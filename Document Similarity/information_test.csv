Cell lines selected in multiple steps for increasing resistance to hydroxyurea have been shown to have corresponding increases in ribonucleotide reductase activity. We have isolated a number of cDNA clones from a cDNA library constructed from a highly hydroxyurea-resistant hamster cell line, 600H, in which the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is elevated more than 80-fold. These clones correspond to genomic DNA sequences amplified in the 600H cell line compared with the V79 parental line. One of these cDNA clones, termed P5, codes for a 50 kDa protein detected by in vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA isolated by hybridization/selection. The cDNA sequence contains a single open reading frame of 1317 nucleotides which encodes a polypeptide of 439 amino acids. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA insert contains two copies of the 11-amino-acid sequence Val-Glu-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Pro-Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys. Duplicate copies of this sequence also occur in the active site of rat and human protein disulphide isomerase (also known as the beta-subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, tri-iodothyronine-binding protein) and in Form I phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, indicating that P5 falls into this newly defined superfamily of proteins. Genomic sequences similar to the cDNA clone are amplified 10-20-fold in hamster cells selected for resistance to increasing concentrations of hydroxyurea, a phenomenon observed earlier with cDNA clones for the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and ornithine decarboxylase. RNA blots probed with P5 cDNA show two poly(A)+ RNA species which are elevated in hydroxyurea-resistant cells.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) is an essential enzyme in the post-translational modification of collagen. Inhibitors of this enzyme are of potential interest for the treatment of diseases involving excessive deposition of collagen. We have found that anthraquinones with at least two hydroxy groups ortho to each other are potent inhibitors of this enzyme. Kinetic studies revealed that 2,7,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone (THA) competitively inhibited the co-substrate, 2-oxoglutarate, but was non-competitive with regard to ascorbate and was tentatively considered to be uncompetitive with regard to protocollagen. The inhibition by THA was greatly enhanced in the absence of added Fe2+ and was partially reversed by the addition of concentrations of Fe2+ in excess of the optimum for the enzymic reaction. Binding studies indicated that THA is an effective chelating agent for Fe2+. Several non-quinoidal compounds bearing the catechol moiety also inhibited the enzyme. The results suggest that THA inhibited prolyl 4-hydroxylase by binding to the enzyme at the site for 2-oxoglutarate possibly involving the Fe2+ atom, rather than by complexing with Fe2+ in free solution. The inhibition of prolyl 4-hydroxylase by THA exhibited strong positive co-operativity and may involve three distinct but non-independent binding sites.

From the structure-activity relationships of known competitive inhibitors, coumalic acid (2-oxo-1,2H-pyran-5-carboxylic acid) was deduced to be a potential syncatalytic inhibitor for chick-embryo prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The compound caused time-dependent inactivation, the reaction rate being first-order. The inactivation constant was 0.094 min-1, the Ki 17 mM and the bimolecular rate constant 0.09 M-1 X S-1. Human prolyl 4-hydroxylase and chick embryo lysyl hydroxylase were also inactivated, though to a lesser extent. Inactivation could be prevented by adding high concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate or its competitive analogues to the reaction mixture. In Lineweaver-Burk kinetics, coumalic acid displayed S-parabolic competitive inhibition with respect to 2-oxoglutarate. The inactivation reaction had cofactor requirements similar to those for the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate. Enzymic activity was partially preserved in the absence of iron, but the rescue was incomplete, owing to decreased stability of the enzyme under this condition. Coumalic acid also decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the alpha-subunit, but the beta-subunit was not affected. Prolonged incubation of coumalic acid above pH 6.8 led to loss of its inactivating potency, owing to hydrolysis. It is concluded that the inactivation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase by coumalic acid is due to a syncatalytic mechanism. The data also suggest that the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site of the enzyme is located within the alpha-subunit.	Time-dependent inactivation of chick-embryo prolyl 4-hydroxylase by coumalic acid.

The anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin were found to act as irreversible inhibitors of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The reaction rate for enzyme from both chick and human origin was first order, the concentration of inhibitor giving 50% inhibition being 60 microM for both compounds after 1 h. The effect was dependent on the presence of iron ions in the reaction mixture. Inactivation could be prevented by addition of high concentrations of ascorbate, but not 2-oxoglutarate, before the inactivation period. The same results were obtained with competitive analogues of these cosubstrates. Lysyl hydroxylase from chick embryos was also susceptible to inactivation. Its activity was decreased by 50% after incubation for 1 h with a 150 microM concentration of the inhibitors. When chick-embryo prolyl 4-hydroxylase was incubated with [14-14C]doxorubicin, both enzyme subunits were radioactively labelled, about 70% of the total radioactivity being found in the alpha-subunit. Since the anthracyclines are known to undergo a redox reaction generating semiquinone radicals with Fe3+ only, the results suggest that the enzyme-bound iron ion is oxidized to a tervalent intermediate in uncoupled reaction cycles. The data also suggest that both enzyme subunits contribute to the catalytic site of prolyl 4-hydroxylase.ImagesFig. 6.	Syncatalytic inactivation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase by anthracyclines.

The levels of lysine hydroxylase protein and the levels of the mRNAs for lysine hydroxylase and the alpha- and beta-subunits of proline 4-hydroxylase were measured in cultured human skin fibroblasts treated with 1 mM-minoxidil. The data demonstrate that minoxidil decreases the amount of lysine hydroxylase protein, this being due to a decrease in the level of lysine hydroxylase mRNA. The effect of minoxidil appears to be highly specific, as no changes were observed in the amounts of mRNAs for the alpha- and beta-subunits of proline 4-hydroxylase.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.

1. The number of reactive thiol groups in mammalian liver protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) in various conditions was investigated by alkylation with iodo[14C]acetate. 2. Both the native enzyme, as isolated, and the urea-denatured enzyme contained negligible reactive thiol groups; the enzyme reduced with dithiothreitol contained two groups reactive towards iodoacetic acid at pH 7.5, and up to five reactive groups were detectable in the reduced denatured enzyme. 3. Modification of the two reactive groups in the reduced native enzyme led to complete inactivation, and the relationship between the loss of activity and the extent of modification was approximately linear. 4. Inactivation of PDI by alkylation of the reduced enzyme followed pseudo-first-order kinetics; a plot of the pH-dependence of the second-order rate constant for inactivation indicated that the essential reactive groups had a pK of 6.7 and a limiting second-order rate constant at high pH of 11 M-1.s-1. 5. Since sequence data on PDI show the presence within the polypeptide of two regions closely similar to thioredoxin, the data strongly indicate that these regions are chemically and functionally equivalent to thioredoxin. 6. The activity of PDI in thiol/disulphide interchange derives from the presence of vicinal dithiol groups in which one thiol group of each pair has an unusually low pK and high nucleophilic reactivity at physiological pH.

1. The activities of protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) and thioredoxin in catalysing disulphide bond isomerization in a protein substrate were compared by using the standard assay, namely the re-activation of 'scrambled' RNAase. 2. The specific activity of PDI was 25-fold greater than that of thioredoxin. 3. The greater efficiency of PDI compared with thioredoxin is considered to be due more to the presence of multiple catalytic domains in PDI than to differences in their active-site sequences. 4. Data and procedures were defined for expressing enzyme activity in standard units, i.e. mumol of active RNAase generated/min.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase was partially purified and characterized from the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardii. This enzyme differed from all the animal and plant prolyl 4-hydroxylases studied so far in that its Mr was only about 40,000 by gel filtration, being thus less than one-sixth of those determined for the vertebrate and higher-plant enzymes. The algal enzyme did not hydroxylate to any significant extent chick-embryo protocollagen or triple-helical (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, whereas a low hydroxylation rate was found with denatured (Pro-Pro-Gly)10. Poly(L-proline), which is an effective inhibitor of the vertebrate enzymes but acts as a substrate for some higher-plant enzymes, was a good substrate. In the absence of poly(L-proline) the enzyme catalysed an uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate. Studies of the Km values for the co-substrates and cofactors and the specificity of the 2-oxoglutarate requirement, as well as inhibition studies with selected 2-oxoglutarate analogues, suggested that the catalytic site of the algal enzyme is similar to, but not identical with, those of the vertebrate enzymes. The existence of distinct similarities was further demonstrated by an inhibition of the algal enzyme activity with a monoclonal antibody to the beta-subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The amount of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in the algal cells was not altered by signals which recognize the presence or absence of the cell wall, as determined in studies on experimental cell-wall regeneration and wall-less mutants.

The deacetylcephalosporin C synthetase (hydroxylase) gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus has been cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame codes for a protein with an Mr of 34,584. The hydroxylase gene (cefF) is closely linked to the epimerase gene (cefD) and the expandase gene (cefE) and is transcribed in the opposite orientation. The hydroxylase and expandase genes are 59 and 71% identical at the amino acid and DNA levels, respectively. cefE and cefF may have arisen from a gene duplication in the actinomycetes.

The microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein (MTP), an alpha beta dimer, is obligatory for the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in liver and intestinal cells. The beta subunit is identical with protein disulphide isomerase, a 58 kDa endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein involved in ensuring correct disulphide bond formation of newly synthesized proteins. We report here the expression of the human MTP subunits in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. When the alpha subunit was expressed alone, the polypeptide formed insoluble aggregates that were devoid of triacylglycerol transfer activity. In contrast, when the alpha and beta subunits were co-expressed, soluble alpha beta dimers were formed with significant triacylglycerol transfer activity. Expression of the alpha subunit with a mutant protein disulphide isomerase polypeptide in which both -CGHC- catalytic sites had been inactivated also yielded alpha beta dimers that had comparable levels of lipid transfer activity relative to wild-type dimers. The results indicate that the role of the beta subunit in MTP seems to be to keep the alpha subunit in a catalytically active, non-aggregated conformation and that disulphide isomerase activity of the beta subunit is not required for this function.	The role of protein disulphide isomerase in the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein does not reside in its isomerase activity.

Human pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) was identified in lung lavage by its similarity to rat SP-D in both its molecular mass and its Ca(2+)-dependent-binding affinity for maltose [Persson, Chang & Crouch (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5755-5760]. For structural studies, human SP-D was isolated from amniotic fluid by affinity chromatography on maltose-Sepharose followed by f.p.l.c. on Superose 6, which showed it to have a molecular mass of approx. 620 kDa in non-dissociating conditions. On SDS/PAGE the human SP-D behaved as a single band of 150 kDa or 43 kDa in non-reducing or reducing conditions respectively. The presence of a high concentration of glycine (22%), hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine in the amino acid composition of human SP-D indicated that it contained collagen-like structure. Collagenase digestion yielded a 20 kDa collagenase-resistant globular fragment which retained affinity for maltose. Use of maltosyl-BSA as a neoglycoprotein ligand in a solid-phase binding assay showed that human SP-D has a similar carbohydrate-binding specificity to rat SP-D, but a clearly distinct specificity from that of other lectins, such as conglutinin, for a range of simple saccharides. Amino acid sequence analysis established the presence of collagen-like Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets in human SP-D and also provided sequence data from the globular region of the molecule which was used in the synthesis of oligonucleotide probes. Screening of a human lung cDNA library with the oligonucleotide probes, and also with rabbit anti-(human SP-D), allowed the isolation of two cDNA clones which overlap to give the full coding sequence of human SP-D. The derived amino acid sequence indicates that the mature human SP-D polypeptide chain is 355 residues long, having a short non-collagen-like N-terminal section of 25 residues, followed by a collagen-like region of 177 residues and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain of 153 residues. Comparison of the human SP-D and bovine serum conglutinin amino acid sequences indicated that they showed 66% identity despite their marked differences in carbohydrate specificity.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.

Inhibition of lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 3-hydroxylase was studied with 23 selected aromatic and aliphatic structural analogues of 2-oxoglutarate and the results were compared with those previously reported for prolyl 4-hydroxylase. All the compounds inhibited the hydroxylases competitively with respect to 2-oxoglutarate and noncompetitively with respect to Fe2+ and the peptide substrate. The inhibition patterns for the three collagen hydroxylases were basically similar, but certain differences in detail emerged. One systematic difference was that lysyl hydroxylase had a higher Ki for almost all the compounds than had the two prolyl hydroxylases. Another interesting difference was that pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate was the most potent inhibitor of lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 3-hydroxylase, with Ki values of 50 microM and 3 microM respectively, whereas pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate was the most potent inhibitor of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. These and other data suggest that the three collagen hydroxylases have similar but not identical 2-oxoglutarate-binding sites. Pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate and pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate and their corresponding benzene derivatives were also found to inhibit 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, but with this enzyme, unlike the collagen hydroxylases, no distinct difference in the Ki values was found between the corresponding pyridine and benzene derivatives. This demonstrates the importance of the metal ion for the binding of various compounds at the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site of the collagen hydroxylases. 2-Oxoadipate was shown to replace 2-oxoglutarate in the lysyl hydroxylase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase reactions, as has previously been reported for prolyl 4-hydroxylase, whereas no other 2-oxo acid tested had any co-substrate activity. The 2-oxoglutarate-binding site of these enzymes is thus flexible to a certain degree, as it can accommodate molecules of different shapes and volumes. On the basis of the present data pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate seems to be a quite specific inhibitor of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the Ki for 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase being about 4000-fold higher.

Human placental lysyl hydroxylase gave two bands in SDS/polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis: a broad, diffuse, major band corresponding to an apparent Mr of 80,000-85,000, and a sharp minor band with Mr 78,000. Mouse and chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylases gave only the broad, diffuse band, whereas the sharp band could not be detected. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared to the two bands of the human enzyme separately, and monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the whole purified enzyme preparation. Both types of polyclonal antibody inhibited and precipitated the enzyme activity, and both stained the two polypeptide bands in immunoblotting after SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Only one out of five monoclonal antibodies inhibited the enzyme activity, whereas they all precipitated the activity when studied with antibody coupled to Sepharose. All five monoclonal antibodies stained the whole broad band in immunoblotting, and at least three of them also stained the sharp band. Peptide maps produced from the two polypeptide species by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were highly similar. Experiments with endoglycosidase H demonstrated that the Mr-80,000-85,000 polypeptide contains asparagine-linked carbohydrate units, which are required for maximal lysyl hydroxylase activity. The data suggest that the lysyl hydroxylase dimer consists of only one type of monomer, the heterogeneity of which is due to differences in glycosylation.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, catalyses the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens. The beta subunit is known to be identical with the enzyme protein disulphide-isomerase and to possess disulphide-isomerase activity even when present in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer. We here report that lysyl hydroxylase, a homodimer, and algal prolyl 4-hydroxylase, a monomer, do not contain detectable protein disulphide-isomerase activity. Since the hydroxylase reaction mechanisms are similar, the data suggest that the protein disulphide-isomerase activity of the vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta subunit is unlikely to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction.	The catalytic mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction of peptidyl proline and lysine does not require protein disulphide-isomerase activity.	R Myllyla, D D Kaska, K I Kivirikko	2557001	1989-10-15	17	
A search for conserved amino acid residues within the cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of 2-oxoglutarate-coupled dioxygenases revealed the presence of two distinct motifs, spaced 49-71 amino acids apart, toward the C-terminal regions of these proteins. Each of the two common motifs contains an invariant histidine residue at a conserved position. The 2-oxoglutarate-coupled dioxygenases function in diverse processes, including the post-translational hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in vertebrate collagens and the biosynthesis of microbial cephalosporins, yet they have a common reaction mechanisms, which requires the binding of Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2 and ascorbate at the catalytic site. The two regions of homology, and specifically the identical histidines, potentially represent functionally important sites related to their catalytic activity. Modification of histidine residues by diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated vertebrate and algal prolyl 4-hydroxylase and vertebrate lysyl hydroxylase, indicating that histidine residues function in the catalytic site of these 2-oxoglutarate-coupled dioxygenases. Inactivation was prevented by the presence of co-substrates, but not by the peptide substrate. It is proposed that the histidine residues in the conserved motifs may function as Fe(2+)-binding ligands.

The sequences of amino acid residues 38--51 of the A-chain, and residues 42--90 of the C-chain, of human subcomponent C1q are given. These results, along with previously published sequence data [Reid (1974) Biochem.J. 141, 189--203; Reid (1977) Biochem.J. 161, 247--251; Reid & Thompson (1978) Biochem.J. 173, 863--868] allow the presentation, and comparison with each other, of the complete amino acid sequences of the collagen-like regions found in the A-, B- and C-chains of human subcomponent C1q. Each chain has the continuity of its collagen-like Gly-X-Y repeating triplet amino acid sequence broken. The B- and C-chains have alanine residues at positions B-9 and C-36 where glycine might be expected. The A-chain has a threonine residue at position A-39, which is located between two Gly-X-Y triplets.

The activity of highly purified lysyl hydroxylase towards lysyl residues within both the helical and the N-terminal non-helical telopeptide regions of chick type I collagen has been examined. The peptides alpha 1(I)-CB1 and alpha 2(I)-CB1, isolated from protocollagen following CNBr digestion and containing the N-terminal telopeptidyl lysyl residues, failed themselves to act as substrates. With protocollagen as substrate, analysis of products obtained following bacterial collagenase digestion of the reaction mixture showed that overall 37% hydroxylation of lysyl residues within the helical region of collagen had been obtained, which may be maximal. No hydroxylation, however, of the single lysyl residue in either alpha 1(I)-CB1 or alpha 2(I)-CB1, isolated following CNBr digestion of the reaction mixture, was observed, despite the known susceptibility of these residues to hydroxylation. These findings provide strong circumstantial evidence for the suggestion that a lysyl hydroxylase specific for the telopeptidyl residues and distinct from that active towards lysyl residues in the helical portion of the molecule may exist [Barnes, Constable, Morton & Royce (1974) Biochem. J. 139, 461-468].	Failure of highly purified lysyl hydroxylase to hydroxylate lysyl residues in the non-helical regions of collagen.	P M Royce, M J Barnes	3931636	1985-09-01	17	
Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is a unique polypeptide which resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and also functions as the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, as a cellular thyroid hormone-binding protein, as the smaller subunit of the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein complex, as a dehydroascorbate reductase and as a protein that binds various peptides in a specific manner. We have recently demonstrated that the promoter of the PDI gene contains six CCAAT boxes and other elements which are needed for efficient transcription. We now demonstrate that purified human recombinant transcription factor Sp1 interacts with two perfect GGGCGG sequences and three other GC-rich elements of the PDI promoter. Sp1 also appears to participate in the regulation of PDI gene expression, since overexpression of Sp1 stimulated PDI promoter activity in HeLa cells and mutations introduced into each of these Sp1-binding sites separately reduced the promoter strength, although even the largest decrease was only about 50%. These results support our view that expression of the gene for this polypeptide with multiple functions is secured by several regulatory elements, some of which are functionally redundant.ImagesFigure 2	Interaction of transcription factor Sp1 with the promoter of the gene for the multifunctional protein disulphide isomerase polypeptide.

Prolyl 3-hydroxylase was purified up to about 5000-fold from an (NH4)2SO4 fraction of chick-embryo extract by a procedure consisting of affinity chromatography on denatured collagen linked to agarose, elution with ethylene glycol and gel filtration. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme is about 160000 by gel filtration The enzyme is probably a glycoprotein, since (a) its activity is inhibited by concanavalin A, and (b) the enzyme is bound to columns of this lectin coupled to agarose and can be eluted with a buffer containing methyl alpha-D-mannoside. The Km values for Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2 and ascorbate in the prolyl 3-hydroxylase reaction were found to be very similar to those previously reported for these co-substrates in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase reactions.

The biochemical and morphological consequences of procollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibition by pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) and its diethyl ester (diethyl-2,4-PDC) were studied in chick-embryo calvaria, which predominantly synthesize type I collagen. Half-maximal inhibition of tissue hydroxyproline formation required 650 microM-2,4-PDCA, whereas the Ki with respect to chicken prolyl 4-hydroxylase in vitro was 2 microM. In contrast, half-maximal inhibition was caused by 10 microM-diethyl-2,4-PDC in the intact calvaria, although chicken prolyl 4-hydroxylase in vitro was not inhibited even at 1 mM. The collagenous material produced in the presence of diethyl-2,4-PDC showed an altered 'melting' profile and a lowering of the transition temperature by 10 degrees C, indicating misalignment and thermal instability of its triple-helical structure. Amount and electrophoretic mobility of procollagen type I chains were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of partially processed species and alpha-chains were decreased, without change in mobility. This marked effect on procollagen-collagen conversion in the intact calvaria suggests that the underhydroxylated collagenous material generated in the presence of diethyl-2,4-PDC is resistant to or acts as endogenous secondary inhibitor of type I procollagen N-proteinase. Electron microscopy of treated calvaria cells showed dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous phagolysosomes, indicating intracellular retention and lysosomal degradation of the newly synthesized underhydroxylated collagenous material. In summary, these results identify 2,4-PDCA and diethyl-2,4-PDC as the first prolyl 4-hydroxylase-directed inhibitor/proinhibitor pair that affects intra- and extra-cellular events during collagen formation.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 4.

The ability of structural analogues of ascorbate to serve as substitutes for this reducing agent in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction was studied. In experiments using the purified enzyme, variations of the compounds' side chain were compatible with co-substrate activity. The presence of very large hydrophobic substituents or a positively charged group caused an increase in the observed Km values. A negative charge and smaller modifications did not change the affinity to the enzyme when compared with L-ascorbate. 6-Bromo-6-deoxy-L-ascorbate had a lower Km than the physiological reductant. Substitution at the -OH group in ring position 3 prevented binding to the enzyme. The same pattern of activity was observed when the full and uncoupled prolyl 4-hydroxylase reactions were studied. The Vmax. values with all compounds were similar. The reaction of microsomal prolyl 4-hydroxylase was supported by D-isoascorbate, O6-tosyl-L-ascorbate and 5-deoxy-L-ascorbate, giving the same dose-response behaviour as L-ascorbate itself. Again, 6-bromo-6-deoxy-L-ascorbate gave a lower Km and a similar Vmax. value. L-Ascorbic acid 6-carboxylate produced substrate inhibition at concentrations above 0.3 mM. The Km and Vmax. values calculated from concentrations up to 0.2 mM were similar to those of L-ascorbate. The enzyme activity observed with 6-amino-6-deoxy-L-ascorbate was very low in the microsomal hydroxylation system. The calculated Vmax. value was lower than that of L-ascorbate, suggesting a restriction of the access of this compound to the enzyme.

Two procedures are reported for the purification of lysyl hydroxylase, both procedures involving (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-agarose and elution of the column with ethylene glycol. The additional steps in procedure A consist of gel filtration and chromatography on a hydroxyapatite column, and in procedure B of affinity chromatography on collagen linked to agarose and gel filtration. The best preparations obtained with either of the two procedures were pure when examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide-disc-gel or slab-gel electrophoresis, but about half of the preparations obtained by procedure A had minor contaminants. The specific activity of a typical preparation purified by procedure B was 13 4000 times that of the 15 000 g supernatant of the chick-embryo homogenate, with a recovery of about 4%. The molecular weight of the pure enzyme was bout 200 000 by gel filtration, and that of the enzyme subunit about 85 000 by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-disc-gel or slab-gel electrophoresis. It is suggested that the active enzyme is a dimer consisting of only one type of monomer, and that a previously described enzyme form with an apparent molecular weight of about 550 000 is a polymeric form of this dimer. The catalytic-centre activity of the pure enzyme, as determined with a saturating concentration of a synthetic peptide substrate and under conditions specified, was about 3-4 mol/s per mol.ImagesFig. 4.

The cysteine proteinases synthesized by the adult stage of the trematode Fasciola hepatica were found to be a very heterogeneous group of proteins as demonstrated by one- and two-dimensional gel analyses. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated the presence of at least two distinct gene products among the secreted cysteine proteinases. Enzymic studies and peptide sequence analysis of the excreted/secreted cysteine proteinases suggested a close relationship to the plant thiol cathepsins and the mammalian cathepsin L subfamily. The cloning of a representative cDNA for a putative Fasciola cathepsin confirmed similarities to the cathepsin L subfamily but revealed low identity with the cathepsin-like proteinases of the related trematode, Schistosoma, nematode cathepsins and the mammalian cathepsin B subfamily. Furthermore, peptide and protein sequencing revealed the modification of certain highly conserved prolines to unusual 3-hydroxyproline derivatives. This is the first report of modified prolines in any proteinase. This finding, as well as the high activities of these cathepsins at neutral to alkaline pH values, raises a number of questions as to the physiological function of these thiol cathepsins and their interaction with host tissues.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 6	The secreted cathepsin L-like proteinases of the trematode, Fasciola hepatica, contain 3-hydroxyproline residues.

Mammalian ribonucleotide reductase consists of two nonidentical subunits, proteins M1 and M2, which are differentially regulated during the cell cycle. We have isolated expressible cDNA clones of both subunits from an Okayama-Berg cDNA library made with mRNA from hydroxyurea-resistant, M2 protein-overproducing mouse TA3 cells. Expression of M2 protein could be demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy after transfection of COS-7 monkey cells with the plasmid. Electrophoresis and blot analyses of the parent and hydroxyurea-resistant TA3 mRNA revealed two M2 transcripts, a major one of 2.1 kilobases and a minor one of about 1.6 kilobases. Restriction endonuclease mapping of the corresponding cDNAs indicated that the two mRNAs differed only in the length of the 3' untranslated ends. By contrast, there was only one mRNA corresponding to the M1 protein, and its mobility corresponded to about 3.1 kilobases. The hydroxyurea-resistant TA3 cells contained a 50- to 100-fold excess of the M2 mRNAs over that of the parent cells and a 10-fold excess of the M1 mRNA. However, a Southern blot analysis of the corresponding genomic DNA sequences showed that the M2 gene was amplified fivefold but the M1 gene was still single copy. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 2,111-base-pair-long M2 cDNA revealed an open reading frame coding for 390 amino acids, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 45,100. The mouse M2 protein sequence was quite homologous to the equivalent protein in the clam Spisula solidissima, while the homology to the smaller subunits of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 2, and Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductases were less pronounced.Images	Isolation and characterization of expressible cDNA clones encoding the M1 and M2 subunits of mouse ribonucleotide reductase.

A convenient technique for the partial purification of large quantities of functional, poly(adenylic acid)-rich mRNA is described. The method depends upon annealing poly(adenylic acid)-rich mRNA to oligothymidylic acid-cellulose columns and its elution with buffers of low ionic strength. Biologically active rabbit globin mRNA has been purified by this procedure and assayed for its ability to direct the synthesis of rabbit globin in a cell-free extract of ascites tumor. Inasmuch as various mammalian mRNAs appear to be rich in poly(adenylic acid) and can likely be translated in the ascites cell-free extract, this approach should prove generally useful as an initial step in the isolation of specific mRNAs.Images	Purification of Biologically Active Globin Messenger RNA by Chromatography on Oligothymidylic acid-Cellulose	Haim Aviv, Philip Leder	4504350	1972-06-01	17	
Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2), an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, catalyses the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens by the hydroxylation of proline residues in peptide linkages. We report here the isolation of cDNA clones coding for the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase from a human hepatoma lambda gt11 library and a corresponding human placenta library. Five overlapping clones covering all the coding sequences and almost all the non-coding sequences were characterized. The size of the mRNA hybridizing with these clones in Northern blotting is approximately 2.5 kb. The clones encode a polypeptide of 508 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 17 amino acids. These human sequences were found to be very similar to those recently reported for rat protein disulphide isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1). The degree of homology between these two proteins was 84% at the level of nucleotide sequences or 94% at the level of amino acid sequences. Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA with a cDNA probe for the beta-subunit indicated the presence of only one gene containing these sequences. The product of a single gene thus appears to possess two different enzymatic functions depending on whether it is present in cells in monomer form or in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 4.

We describe a simple procedure for isolating specific mRNAs and for mapping them to the regions of the DNA from which they originate. The method involves hybridization of total cytoplasmic RNA to restriction fragments of DNA that have been fractionated in agarose gels and immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. The hybridization-selected RNAs are eluted and translated in a cell-free system in order to identify their encoded polypeptides. Optimal hybridization and filter washing conditions are given for selection of mRNAs from adenovirus 2-infected cells and transformed cells.Images	Purification and mapping of specific mRNAs by hybridization-selection and cell-free translation.

Prolyl hydroxylase (proline,2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, EC 1.14.11.2) is a mixed-function oxygenase that hydroxylates peptidyl proline with the simultaneous and stoichiometric decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate and CO2. It has been found that highly purified preparations of the enzyme can decarboxylate alpha-ketoglutarate in the absence of a peptidyl proline substrate. The uncoupled decarboxylation proceeds at only a fraction of the rate of the whole reaction and for study requires substrate quantities of the pure enzyme, as well as oxygen, ferrous ion, and ascorbate. No hydroxyproline is formed under these conditions. Immobilized antiserum to prolyl hydroxylase was found to remove both activities from enzyme preparations. However, addition of free antiserum during incubation inhibits only the complete reaction. Poly(L-proline), a specific inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation, enhances the uncoupled decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate without itself being hydroxylated. All of these findings prove that alpha-ketoglutarate can serve as substrate in the absence of peptidyl proline and is most likely the initial site of attack by oxygen. In the coupled reaction an oxidized form of the keto acid, perhaps a peroxy acid, then attacks prolyl residues in the unhydroxylated substrate.

A protein, enzymatically inactive but immunologically related to prolyl hydroxylase (prolyl-glycyl-peptide, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.14.11.2) (cross-reacting protein), has been purified to near homogeneity from skin of newborn rats. The purified protein has a molecular weight of 60,000 on gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, corresponding to that of the smaller of the two dissimilar subunits of the enzyme. The two subunits of prolyl hydroxylase differ markedly from one another in their amino acid compositions, but crossreating protein and the smaller subunit are very similar in composition. On antibody-affinity chromatography both subunits reacted with the antibody developed against the intact enzyme. Neither crossreacting protein nor the 60,000 molecular weight subunit was adsorbed onto concanavalin A, which adsorbed the intact enzyme as well as the larger subunit. It would appear that crossreacting protein is identical to one of the subunits of prolyl hydroxylase or metabolically related to it.Images	Homology between a prolyl hydroxylase subunit and a tissue protein that crossreacts immunologically with the enzyme.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) is a key enzyme required for the posttranslational hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of two pairs of nonidentical subunits (alpha 2 beta 2). The beta subunit is protein disulfide-isomerase, a ubiquitous enzyme found in the endoplasmic reticulum of many cell types. We report here the amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit. One cDNA clone (alpha 1) was isolated from a chicken embryo cDNA expression library in lambda gt11 by screening with anti-alpha-subunit polyclonal immunoglobulins. This alpha 1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1401 base pairs. A comparison of the translation of the nucleotide sequence with protein sequences obtained from the purified chicken alpha-subunit polypeptide verified that alpha 1 cDNA encoded the alpha subunit. Polymerase chain reactions were used to extend the sequence of alpha 1 cDNA toward the 5' end of alpha-subunit mRNA. The mature alpha subunit is composed of 516 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 59,373 Da. The compiled amino acid sequence contains two potential glycosylation sites, an observation that agrees with a previous demonstration that the alpha subunit contains two N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Blot hybridization analysis of total chicken embryo RNA detected an mRNA of 3.5 kilobases, a size that closely resembles the size of the cloned cDNA. Since the expression of the alpha subunit is confined to cell types that synthesize and secrete collagens, the regulation of the synthesis of the alpha subunit may play a central role in determining the expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity.Images	Prolyl 4-hydroxylase: molecular cloning and the primary structure of the alpha subunit from chicken embryo.

Several recent studies indicate that a single polypeptide may act as the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the enzyme protein disulphide-isomerase and a cellular thyroid-hormone-binding protein. We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding this multifunctional protein in the chicken. All the coding sequences were determined on the basis of nucleotide sequencing of five cDNA clones and amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal end of the chicken beta-subunit. The processed polypeptide contains 493 amino acid residues, the size of the respective mRNA being about 2.7 kb. The chicken beta-subunit cDNA sequences were 78% homologous to the previously reported human beta-subunit cDNA sequences at the nucleotide level and 85% homologous at the amino acid level. The homology of the chicken beta-subunit sequences to those reported for bovine thyroid-hormone-binding protein and rat protein disulphide-isomerase was also 85% at the amino acid level. Primary-structure comparisons between the four species indicated that the two proposed active sites of protein disulphide-isomerase, the two Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys-Lys sequences, are located within highly conserved regions, which are also homologous to the active sites of a number of thioredoxins. The middle of the polypeptide has an additional conserved region 100 amino acid residues in length in which the degree of homology between the four species is 94% at the amino acid level. This long conserved region may also be important for some of the multiple functions of the protein. The four extreme C-terminal amino acids of the polypeptide in all four species are Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, a sequence that has been suggested to function as a signal for the retention of a protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 5.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase [procollagen-proline, 2-oxyglutarate 4-dioxygenase; procollagen-L-proline, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.11.2], an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens by the hydroxylation of proline residues in peptide linkages. We report here on the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the alpha-subunit of the enzyme from human tumor HT-1080, placenta, and fibroblast cDNA libraries. Eight overlapping clones covering almost all of the corresponding 3000-nucleotide mRNA, including all the coding sequences, were characterized. These clones encode a polypeptide of 517 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Previous characterization of cDNA clones for the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase has indicated that its C terminus has the amino acid sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, which, it has been suggested, is necessary for the retention of a polypeptide within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The alpha-subunit does not have this C-terminal sequence, and thus one function of the beta-subunit in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer appears to be to retain the enzyme within this cell organelle. Interestingly, three of the cDNA clones for the alpha-subunit contained a 64-nucleotide sequence homologous but not identical to the corresponding 64-nucleotide sequence found in four other cDNA clones. Nuclease S1 mapping experiments demonstrated that this difference was due to the existence of two types of mRNA present in approximately equal amounts. Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA with a cDNA probe for the alpha-subunit suggested the presence of only one gene encoding the two types of mRNA, which appear to result from mutually exclusive alternative splicing of primary transcripts of one gene.Images	Molecular cloning of the alpha-subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase: the complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence and evidence for alternative splicing of RNA transcripts.

1. Protein disulphide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) and glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase (EC 1.8.4.2) were resolved by covalent chromatography. Both activities, in a partially purified preparation from bovine liver, bind covalently as mixed disulphides to activated thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B, in a new stepwise elution procedure protein disulphide-isomerase is displaced in mildly reducing conditions whereas glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase is only displaced by more extreme reducing conditions. 2. This together with evidence for partial resolution of the two activities by ion-exchange chromatography, conclusively establishes that the two activities are not alternative activities of a single bovine liver enzyme. 3. Protein disulphide-isomerase, partially purified by a published procedure, has now been further purified by covalent chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. The final material is 560-fold purified relative to a bovine liver homogenate; it has barely detectable glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase activity. 4. The purified protein disulphide-isomerase shows a single major band on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis corresponding to a mol.wt. of 57000. 5. The purified protein disulphide-isomerase has Km values for 'scrambled' ribonuclease and dithiothreitol of 23 microgram/ml and 5.4 microM respectively and has a sharp pH optimum at 7.5. The enzyme has a broad thiol-specificity, and several monothiols, at 1mM, can replace dithiothreitol. 6. The purified protein disulphide-isomerase is completely inactivated after incubation with a 2-3 fold molar excess of iodoacetate. The enzyme is also significantly inhibited by low concentrations of Cd2+ ions. These findings strongly suggest the existence of a vicinal dithiol group essential for enzyme activity. 7. When a range of thiols were used as co-substrates for protein disulphide-isomerase activity, the activities were found to co-purify quantitatively, implying the presence of a single protein disulphide-isomerase of broad thiol-specificity. Glutathione-disulphide transhydrogenase activities, assayed with a range of disulphide compounds, did not co-purify quantitatively.

Protein disulphide-isomerase from bovine liver was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid analysis. The preparative procedure, a modification of that of Carmichael, Morin & Dixon [(1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7163-7167], is much faster and higher-yielding than previous procedures, and the final purified material is of higher specific activity. The enzyme has Mr 57 000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, both in the presence and in the absence of thiol compounds. Gel-filtration studies on Sephadex G-200 indicate an Mr of 107 000, suggesting that the native enzyme is a homodimer with no interchain disulphide bonds. Ultracentrifugation studies give a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5S, implying that the enzyme sediments as the monomer. The isoelectric point, in the presence of 8 M-urea, is 4.2, and some microheterogeneity is detectable. The amino acid composition is comparable with previous analyses of this enzyme from bovine liver and of other preparations of thiol:protein disulphide oxidoreductases whose relation to protein disulphide-isomerase has been controversial. The enzyme contains a very high proportion of Glx + Asx residues (27%). The N-terminal residue is His. The pure enzyme has a very small carbohydrate content, determined as 0.5-1.0% by the phenol/H2SO4 assay. Unless specific steps are taken to remove it, the purified enzyme contains a small amount (5 mol/mol of enzyme) of Triton X-100 carried through the purification.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.

The protein disulphide-bond isomerization activity of highly active homogeneous protein disulphide-isomerase (measured by re-activation of 'scrambled' ribonuclease) is enhanced by EDTA and by phosphate buffers. As shown for previous less-active preparations, the enzyme has a narrow pH optimum around pH 7.8 and requires the presence of either a dithiol or a thiol. The dithiol dithiothreitol is effective at concentrations 100-fold lower than the monothiols reduced glutathione and cysteamine. The enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to these substrates; Km values are 4,620 and 380 microM respectively. The enzyme shows apparent inhibition by high concentrations of thiol or dithiol compounds (greater than 10 X Km), but the effect is mainly on the extent of reaction, not the initial rate. This is interpreted as indicating the formation of significant amounts of reduced ribonuclease in these more reducing conditions. The purified enzyme will also catalyse net reduction of insulin disulphide bonds by reduced glutathione (i.e. it has thiol:protein-disulphide oxidoreductase or glutathione:insulin transhydrogenase activity), but this requires considerably higher concentrations of enzyme and reduced glutathione than does the disulphide-isomerization activity. The Km for reduced glutathione in this reaction is an order of magnitude greater than that for the disulphide-isomerization activity, and the turnover number is considerably lower than that of other enzymes that can catalyse thiol-disulphide oxidoreduction. Conventional two-substrate steady-state analysis of the thiol:protein-disulphide oxidoreductase activity indicates that it follows a ternary-complex mechanism. The protein disulphide-isomerase and thiol:protein-disulphide oxidoreductase activities co-purify quantitatively through the final stages of purification, implying that a single protein species is responsible for both activities. It is concluded that previous preparations, from various sources, that have been referred to as protein disulphide-isomerase, disulphide-interchange enzyme, thiol:protein-disulphide oxidoreductase or glutathione:insulin transhydrogenase are identical or homologous proteins. The assay, nomenclature and physiological role of this enzyme are discussed.

Protein disulphide-isomerase was purified to homogeneity from rat liver by a rapid high-yielding procedure. Structural properties of the pure enzyme were very similar to those of the bovine liver enzyme purified by the same method. The purified rat liver enzyme was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the presence and in the absence of microsomal membranes, and shown to co-electrophorese with a major acidic polypeptide clearly identifiable in the two-dimensional electrophoretic profile of microsomal membranes. This identification was confirmed by peptide 'mapping' of the pure enzyme and of the defined spot from a two-dimensional electrophoresis gel.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.

1. The redox properties of the active-site dithiol/disulphide groups of PDI were determined by equilibrating the enzyme with an excess of GSH + GSSG, rapidly alkylating the dithiol form of the enzyme to inactivate it irreversibly, and determining the proportion of the disulphide form by measuring the residual activity under standard conditions. 2. The extent of reduction varied with the applied redox potential; to a first approximation, the data fitted a model in which all the enzyme dithiol/disulphide groups are independent and equivalent and the equilibrium constant between these sites and the GSH/GSSG redox couple is 42 microM at pH 7.5. 3. The standard redox potential for PDI active-site dithiol/disulphide couples was calculated from this result and found to be -0.11 V; hence PDI is a stronger oxidant and weaker reductant than GSH, nicotinamide cofactors, thioredoxin and dithiothreitol. 4. The redox equilibrium data for PDI with the GSH/GSSG redox couple showed sigmoidal deviations from linearity. The sigmoidicity could be modelled closely by assuming a Hill coefficient of 1.5. 5. This evidence of co-operative interactions between the four active sites in a PDI dimer was extended by studying the reaction between PDI and homobifunctional alkylating agents with various lengths between the reactive groups. A species whose electrophoretic mobility suggested it contained an intrachain cross-link was observed in all cases, whereas there was no evidence for cross-linking between the chains of the PDI homodimer. Most effective cross-linking was achieved with reagents containing five or more methylene spacer groups, implying a minimum distance of 1.6 nm (16 A) between the active-site reactive groups within the two thioredoxin-like domains of the PDI polypeptide.ImagesFig. 4.

1. Inhibition of endogenous microsomal NADPH oxidase by CO enables membrane-bound glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase (EC 1.8.4.2) to be assayed conveniently by a linked assay involving NADPH and glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2). 2. The specific activity of the enzyme in rat liver microsomal preparations is of the order of 1 nmol of oxidized glutathione formed/min per mg of membrane protein. 3. The specific activity of the enzyme is comparable in rough and smooth microsomal fractions, and the activity is not affected by treatment with EDTA and the removal of ribosomes from rough microsomal fractions. 4. Membrane-bound glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase is not affected by concentrations of deoxycholate up to 0.5%, whereas protein disulphide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) is drastically inhibited. 5. On these grounds it is concluded that, in rat liver microsomal fractions, glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase and protein disulphide-isomerase activities are not both catalysed by a single enzyme species.ImagesPLATE 1	Thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductases.

The enzyme prolyl hydroxylase (proline: 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, EC 1.14.11.12), induced in suspension-cultured cells of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (French bean) by treatment with an elicitor preparation from the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, has been investigated. The enzyme, which catalyses the hydroxylation of poly-L-proline with the stoichiometric decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, has been shown to be localized mainly in smooth endoplasmic reticulum. After solubilization from microsomal membranes, the hydroxylase was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on poly-L-proline-Sepharose 4B. The subunit Mr, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulphate/poly-acrylamide-gel electrophoresis, was 65 000, the subunit apparently being recovered as a doublet: the subunits associate under non-denaturing conditions to give at least a tetramer. The bean hydroxylase has kinetic properties and cofactor requirements similar to those previously reported for the enzyme from other plants. Elicitor treatment of suspension-cultured bean cells leads to a rapid induction of prolyl hydroxylase activity concomitant with induction of a protein: arabinosyl-transferase and increased levels of an arabinosylated hydroxyproline-rich protein.

Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase (expandase), which catalyzes ring expansion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC), has been stabilized in vitro and purified to near homogeneity from the industrially important fungus Cephalosporium acremonium. Throughout the purification, the expandase activity remained physically associated with and in a constant ratio of 7:1 to DAOC hydroxylase activity. The latter activity mediates hydroxylation of DAOC to deacetylcephalosporin C (DAC). The copurified expandase/hydroxylase appeared to be monomeric, with a molecular weight of 41,000 +/- 2,000 and an isoelectric point of 6.3 +/- 0.3. Both catalytic activities required alpha-ketoglutarate, Fe2+, and O2 and were stimulated by ascorbate, dithiothreitol, and ATP. The Fe2+ requirement was specific, and sulfhydryl groups in the purified protein were apparently essential for both ring expansion and hydroxylation. The kinetics and stoichiometry of DAOC/DAC formation from the expandase/hydroxylase-catalyzed reactions suggested that ring expansion of penicillin N preceded hydroxylation of DAOC.Images	Copurification and characterization of deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase/hydroxylase from Cephalosporium acremonium.

The predicted amino acid sequences of isopenicillin N synthetase from both Cephalosporium acremonium and Penicillium chrysogenum have two cysteine residues in analogous positions (Cys-106 and Cys-255 in the C. acremonium numbering). To examine the role of these cysteine residues in the activity of the C. acremonium enzyme, we used site-directed in vitro mutagenesis to change these cysteine residues to serine residues. Mutation of Cys-255 reduces specific activity approximately equal to 50%, whereas mutation of Cys-106 or mutation of both Cys-106 and Cys-255 reduces specific activity about 97%. This suggests that the cysteines are important but not essential for IPNS activity. Alkylation of IPNS also almost completely inactivated the enzyme, but residual activity could have been due to incomplete alkylation. Atomic substitution via genetic manipulation in this case is a more accurate means of assessing the role of sulfhydryl moieties in enzyme activity.Images	Analysis of the role of cysteine residues in isopenicillin N synthetase activity by site-directed mutagenesis.

Biosynthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics involves an expansion of the five-membered thiazolidine ring of penicillin N to the six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of deacetoxycephalosporin C by a deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase (DAOCS) enzyme activity. Hydroxylation of deacetoxycephalosporin C to form deacetylcephalosporin C by a deacetylcephalosporin C synthetase (DACS) activity is the next step in biosynthesis of cephalosporins. In Cephalosporium acremonium, both of these catalytic activities are exhibited by a bifunctional enzyme, DAOCS-DACS, encoded by a single gene, cefEF. In Streptomyces clavuligerus, separable enzymes, DAOCS (expandase) and DACS (hydroxylase), catalyze these respective reactions. We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed in E. coli an S. clavuligerus gene, designated cefE, which encodes DAOCS but not DACS. The deduced amino acid sequence of DAOCS from S. clavuligerus (calculated Mr of 34,519) shows marked similarity (approximately 57%) to the deduced sequence of DAOCS-DACS from C. acremonium; however, the latter sequence is longer by 21 amino acid residues.Images	Cloning, characterization, and expression in Escherichia coli of the Streptomyces clavuligerus gene encoding deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase.

A cosmid clone containing closely linked beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthetic genes was isolated from a gene library of Flavobacterium sp. SC 12,154. The location within the cluster of the DNA thought to contain the gene for delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS), the first step in the beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthetic pathway, was identified by a novel method. This DNA facilitated the isolation, by cross-hybridization, of the corresponding DNA from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064, Penicillium chrysogenum Oli13 and Aspergillus nidulans R153. Evidence was obtained which confirmed that the cross-hybridizing sequences contained the ACVS gene. In each case the ACVS gene was found to be closely linked to other beta-lactam biosynthetic genes and constituted part of a gene cluster.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.

"Isopenicillin N isomerase (epimerase) has been purified from Streptomyces clavuligerus, and the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus has been determined. By using single oligonucleotide probes based on high GC codon bias (""guessmers""), the translation start codons were determined for two successive genes in the beta-lactam-biosynthetic pathway and mapped within a 3.6-kilobase-pair KpnI restriction fragment. The epimerase gene (cefD) was located immediately upstream of the deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase (expandase) gene (cefE) that was characterized previously. cefD was sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli; the resulting cell extracts contained epimerase activity. Western immunoblots demonstrated that a protein comigrated with purified S. clavuligerus epimerase at 44 kilodaltons. cefD and cefE were separated by an 81-base-pair segment. The DNA sequence upstream of the epimerase gene had a high AT content, suggestive of a promoter region. Primer extension analysis of S. clavuligerus mRNA showed that the start of transcription occurred approximately 130 base pairs upstream of the epimerase translation start site; Northern (RNA blot) analysis revealed a hybridization signal large enough to code for both epimerase and expandase, and nuclease S1 protection assays showed that a single message may code for epimerase, expandase, and another unknown protein. When cefD and cefE were placed in an expression vector, concomitant synthesis of both epimerase and expandase occurred in E. coli.Images"	The beta-lactam biosynthesis genes for isopenicillin N epimerase and deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase are expressed from a single transcript in Streptomyces clavuligerus.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2), an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, catalyzes the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens. The enzyme can easily be dissociated into its subunits, but all attempts to associate a tetramer from the dissociated subunits in vitro have been unsuccessful. Molecular cloning of the catalytically important alpha subunit has identified two types of cDNA clone due to mutually exclusive alternative splicing. The beta subunit is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide, being identical to the enzyme protein disulfide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1). We report here on expression of the alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and a fully active enzyme tetramer in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells by baculovirus vectors. When the beta subunit was expressed alone, the polypeptide produced was found in a 0.1% Triton X-100 extract of the cell homogenate and was a fully active protein disulfide-isomerase. When either form of the alpha subunit was expressed alone, only traces of the alpha subunit could be extracted from the cell homogenate with 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% SDS was required to obtain efficient solubilization. These alpha subunits had no prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. When the cells were coinfected with both alpha- and beta-subunit-producing viruses, an enzyme tetramer was formed, but significant amounts of alpha and beta subunits remained unassociated. The recombinant tetramer was indistinguishable from that isolated from vertebrate tissue in terms of its specific activity and kinetic constants for cosubstrates and the peptide substrate. The two alternatively spliced forms of the alpha subunit gave enzyme tetramers with identical catalytic properties. Baculovirus expression seems to be an excellent system for mass production of the enzyme tetramer and for detailed investigation of the mechanisms involved in the association of the monomers.Images	Characterization of the human prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer and its multifunctional protein disulfide-isomerase subunit synthesized in a baculovirus expression system.

Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide, identical to the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. It has two -Cys-Gly-His-Cys- sequences which represent two independently acting catalytic sites of PDI activity. We report here on the expression in baculovirus vectors of various mutant PDI/beta-subunits together with a wild-type alpha-subunit of the human prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. When either one or both of the -Cys-Gly-His-Cys- sequences was converted to -Ser-Gly-His-Cys-, a tetramer was formed as with wild-type PDI/beta-subunit. This tetramer was fully active prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The data demonstrate that PDI activity of the PDI/beta-subunit is not required for tetramer assembly or for the prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity of the tetramer, and thus other sequences of the PDI/beta-subunit may be critical for keeping the alpha-subunits in a catalytically active, non-aggregated conformation. Measurements of the PDI activities of tetramers containing the various mutant PDI/beta-subunits demonstrated that the activity of the wild-type tetramer is almost exclusively due to the C-terminal PDI catalytic sites, which explains the finding that the PDI activity of the PDI/beta-subunit present in the tetramer is about half that in the free polypeptide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)Images	Site-directed mutagenesis of human protein disulphide isomerase: effect on the assembly, activity and endoplasmic reticulum retention of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells.

Retina cognin (R-cognin) is a developmentally regulated 50-kDa protein that was isolated from chicken embryo retina cell membranes. It mediates the adhesion and reaggregation in vitro of retina cells from chicken and mouse embryos, but not of cells from other tissues, and may be involved in neuronal differentiation. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for R-cognin. A chicken embryo retina cDNA library was constructed in lambda gt11 vector and was screened with polyclonal R-cognin antiserum, yielding several immunoreactive clones. Antiserum prepared to the R-cognin-beta-galactosidase fusion protein produced by one recombinant lysogen recognized the 50-kDa R-cognin protein derived from retina cell membranes. This antiserum inhibited the reaggregation of dissociated retina cells and immunostained chicken embryo retina tissue in a pattern similar to that obtained with R-cognin antiserum. In vitro translation of RNA from a cDNA subclone yielded a 50-kDa protein that was recognized by R-cognin antiserum on a Western blot. By these criteria we identify the cDNA clone as representative of the gene encoding R-cognin. This cDNA is nearly identical to a major portion of the cDNA for the multifunctional protein that is the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and has both protein disulfide isomerase activity and thyroid hormone-binding activity. These findings demonstrate that R-cognin differs from other cell adhesion molecules and suggest possible mechanisms for its action in cell adhesion and neuronal differentiation.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 4	cDNA for R-cognin: homology with a multifunctional protein.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) catalyzes the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens. The vertebrate enzyme is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, the beta subunit of which is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide, being identical to protein disulfide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1). We report here the cloning of a second mouse alpha subunit isoform, termed the alpha (II) subunit. This polypeptide consists of 518 aa and a signal peptide of 19 aa. The processed polypeptide is one residue longer than the mouse alpha (I) subunit (the previously known type), the cloning of which is also reported here. The overall amino acid sequence identity between the mouse alpha (II) and alpha (I) subunits is 63%. The mRNA for the alpha (II) subunit was found to be expressed in a variety of mouse tissues. When the alpha (II) subunit was expressed together with the human protein disulfide-isomerase/beta subunit in insect cells by baculovirus vectors, an active prolyl 4-hydroxylase was formed, and this protein appeared to be an alpha (II) 2 beta 2 tetramer. The activity of this enzyme was very similar to that of the human alpha (I) 2 beta 2 tetramer, and most of its catalytic properties were also highly similar, but it differed distinctly from the latter in that it was inhibited by poly(L-proline) only at very high concentrations. This property may explain why the type II enzyme was not recognized earlier, as an early step in the standard purification procedure for prolyl 4-hydroxylase is affinity chromatography on a poly(L-proline) column.ImagesFig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 4Fig. 5	Cloning, baculovirus expression, and characterization of a second mouse prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha-subunit isoform: formation of an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer with the protein disulfide-isomerase/beta subunit.

A receptor binding to the C1q subcomponent of complement has been reported by many workers. In this paper we report for the first time that C1q receptor binds not only to C1q, but also to three other structurally similar ligands, namely mannan binding protein (MBP), conglutinin, and lung surfactant protein (SP-A). All these ligands have been reported to enhance removal of species bound to their globular domain from blood (MBP, conglutinin, C1q) or lung (SP-A) through phagocytosis. One of the possible roles for ligand-receptor binding may be initiation of phagocytosis.	Human leukocyte C1q receptor binds other soluble proteins with collagen domains		2388038	1990-09-01	17	
Carbohydrate recognition by bovine serum conglutinin has been investigated by inhibition and direct binding assays using glycoproteins and polysaccharides from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), and neoglycolipids derived from N-acetylglucosamine oligomers, mannobiose and human milk oligosaccharides. The results clearly show that conglutinin is a lectin which binds terminal N-acetylglucosamine, mannose and fucose residues as found in chitobiose (GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc), mannobiose (Man alpha 1-3Man) and lacto-N-fucopentaose II [Fuc alpha 1-4(Gal beta 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc] respectively.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.

Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-rich material that promotes alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-fluid interface in the peripheral air spaces. The turnover of surfactant phospholipids in the alveolar space is fast, and several lines of evidence suggest there is rapid formation and replenishment of the phospholipid surface film during normal respiration. Specific proteins may regulate these dynamic surface properties. The predominant surfactant protein is a well-characterized, lipid-associated glycoprotein, SP 28-36 (28-36 kDa). A second group of very hydrophobic proteins has recently been shown to affect the surface activity of surfactant phospholipids. We have isolated this group of hydrophobic proteins, herein called SP 5-18 (5-18 kDa), from canine surfactant and have shown by NH2-terminal sequence analysis that at least two proteins, SP 5-8 and SP 18, are present in this group. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of SP 18 from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs identified with oligonucleotide probes that were based on the NH2-terminal amino acids of SP 18. The protein isolated from extracellular surfactant appears to be a fragment of a much larger precursor protein (40 kDa). The amino acid sequence of SP 18 is markedly hydrophobic and contains two possible bilayer-spanning domains. We have shown that SP 18 and the glycoprotein SP 28-36 have a cooperative, calcium-dependent action in promoting the formation of phospholipid surface films.Images	Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of pulmonary surfactant protein SP 18 and evidence for cooperation between SP 18 and SP 28-36 in surfactant lipid adsorption.

Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-protein complex that promotes alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-fluid interface in the peripheral air spaces. A group of hydrophobic surfactant-associated proteins has been shown to be essential for rapid surface film formation by surfactant phospholipids. We have purified a hydrophobic surfactant protein of approximately 5 kDa that we term SP5 from bronchopulmonary lavage fluid from a patient with alveolar proteinosis and shown that it promotes rapid surface film formation by simple mixtures of phospholipids. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of human SP5 from the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs identified with oligonucleotide probes based on the NH2-terminal sequence of SP5. SP5 isolated from surfactant is a fragment of a much larger precursor protein (21 kDa). The precursor contains an extremely hydrophobic region of 34 amino acids that comprises most of the mature SP5. This hydrophobicity explains the unusual solubility characteristics of SP5 and the fact that it is lipid-associated when isolated from lung.Images	Low molecular weight human pulmonary surfactant protein (SP5): isolation, characterization, and cDNA and amino acid sequences.

Hydrophobic surfactant-associated protein of Mr 6000-14,000 was isolated from ether/ethanol or chloroform/methanol extracts of mammalian pulmonary surfactant. Automated Edman degradation in a gas-phase sequencer showed the major N-terminus of the human low molecular weight protein to be Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Cys-Arg-Ala-Leu-. Because of the N-terminal phenylalanine, the surfactant protein was designated SPL(Phe). Antiserum generated against hydrophobic surfactant protein(s) from bovine pulmonary surfactant recognized protein of Mr 6000-14,000 in immunoblot analysis and was used to screen a lambda gt11 expression library constructed from adult human lung poly(A)+ RNA. This resulted in identification of a 1.4-kilobase cDNA clone that was shown to encode the N-terminus of the surfactant polypeptide SPL(Phe) (Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-) within an open reading frame for a larger protein. Expression of a fused beta-galactosidase-SPL(Phe) gene in Escherichia coli yielded an immunoreactive Mr 34,000 fusion peptide. Hybrid-arrested translation with this cDNA and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products of human poly(A)+ RNA with a surfactant polyclonal antibody resulted in identification of a Mr 40,000 precursor protein. Blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA from human lung detected a 2.0-kilobase RNA that was more abundant in adult lung than in fetal lung. The larger RNA and translation product indicates that SPL(Phe) is derived by proteolysis of a large polypeptide precursor. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein, beginning Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Try-, comprises a hydrophobic peptide that is a major protein component of surfactant lipid extracts used successfully to treat hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants. These proteins, and specifically SPL(Phe), may therefore be useful for synthesis of replacement surfactants for treatment of hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants or of other surfactant-deficient states.Images	cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of human pulmonary surfactant-associated proteolipid SPL(Phe).

Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells. Radioactive phosphatidylcholine has been used as a marker for surfactant secretion. We report findings that suggest that surfactant inhibits secretion of 3H-labeled phosphatidylcholine by cultured rat type II cells. The lipid components and the surfactant protein group of Mr 26,000-36,000 (SP 26-36) inhibit secretion to different extents. Surfactant lipids do not completely inhibit release; in concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml, lipids inhibit stimulated secretion by 40%. SP 26-36 inhibits release with an EC50 of 0.1 microgram/ml. At concentrations of 1.0 microgram/ml, SP 26-36 inhibits basal secretion and reduces to basal levels secretion stimulated by terbutaline, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the ionophore A23187. The inhibitory effect of SP 26-36 can be blocked by washing type II cells after adding SP 26-36, by heating the proteins to 100 degrees C for 10 min, by adding antiserum specific to SP 26-36, or by incubating cells in the presence of 0.2 mM EGTA. SP 26-36 isolated from canine and human sources also inhibits phosphatidylcholine release from rat type II cells. Neither type I collagen nor serum apolipoprotein A-1 inhibits secretion. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that surfactant secretion is under feedback regulatory control.

Two forms of pig kidney calpain II were isolated, both of which appeared to contain an intact 80 kDa large subunit, but which showed specific proteolytic degradation at the N-terminal end of the 30 kDa small subunit. The structure of each of these molecules was investigated by amino acid sequence analysis. The forms corresponded to molecules with small subunits starting at residue 38 (degraded calpain A) and at residue 62 (degraded calpain B) of the complete sequence. These molecules were tested for their ability to interact with phosphatidylinositol and with carbohydrate (agarose gel-filtration media). Calpain and degraded calpain A, but not degraded calpain B, would interact with phosphatidylinositol. Thus the sequence (G)17TAMRILG (residues 38-61) is essential for the interaction. Neither calpain nor the degraded forms of the enzyme showed specific interaction with carbohydrate.ImagesFig. 1.

Oligosaccharide recognition by three mammalian mannose-binding proteins was investigated by using as probes a series of structurally characterized neoglycolipids in t.l.c. binding assays. The neoglycolipids were derived from N-linked oligosaccharides of complex, high-mannose and hybrid types and from human milk oligosaccharides and simple di- and tri-saccharides. The three proteins, namely the recombinant carbohydrate-recognition domain of rat mannose-binding Protein A and the multi-subunit forms of rat and human serum mannose-binding proteins, were shown to have in common reactivity with oligosaccharide probes containing one or more non-reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue(s). Substitution with galactose masks reactivity. The three proteins also bound to non-reducing terminal mannose residues in high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, non-reducing terminal fucose residues in the sequence Fuc alpha 1-4(Gal beta 1-3)GlcNAc and non-reducing terminal glucose residues in dextran oligomers; the recombinant binding domain gave consistently weaker binding. The relative reactivities with the various probes differ for each protein. Overall, the reaction patterns of the three mammalian proteins differ from that of the plant lectin concanavalin A, which showed preferential binding to the high-mannose type, weak binding to biantennary complex type and no binding to the fuco-oligosaccharide and simple oligosaccharide probes. As a group, the three mammalian proteins resemble bovine serum conglutinin and behave as lectins with rather broad sugar specificities directed at certain non-reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, glucose and fucose residues, but with subtle differences in fine specificities. These results illustrate the potential of neoglycolipids in studies of oligosaccharide recognition by natural and recombinant proteins of diverse biological systems.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase was isolated in a highly purified form from a multi-cellular green alga, Volvox carteri, by a procedure consisting of ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on poly(L-hydroxyproline) coupled to Sepharose. Two other affinity-column procedures were also developed, one involving 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate and the other 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionate linked to Sepharose. The Km values of the Volvox enzyme for the co-substrates and the peptide substrate, as well as the inhibition constants for selected 2-oxoglutarate analogues, were similar to those of the enzyme from Chlamydomonas reinhardii, except that the Km for 2-oxoglutarate with the Volvox enzyme was 6-fold greater. The temperature optimum of the Volvox enzyme was also 10 degrees C higher. The apparent Mr of the Volvox enzyme by gel filtration was about 40,000, being similar to that reported for the Chlamydomonas enzyme but markedly lower than that of the vertebrate enzymes. A similar apparent Mr of about 40,000 was also found for prolyl 4-hydroxylase from the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis, whereas the enzyme from various vascular plants gave an apparent Mr greater than 300,000. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis demonstrated in the highly purified Volvox enzyme the presence of a major protein band doublet with a Mr of about 65,000 and a minor doublet of Mr about 55,000-57,000. A polyclonal antiserum, prepared against the Mr-65,000 doublet, stained in immunoblotting the Mr-65,000 doublet as well as the alpha subunit, but not the beta subunit, of the vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase. An antiserum against the beta subunit of the vertebrate enzyme stained in immunoblotting a Mr-50,000 polypeptide in a partially purified Volvox enzyme preparation, but did not stain either the Mr-65,000 or the Mr-55,000-57,000 doublet of the highly purified enzyme. The data thus suggest that the active Volvox carteri prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an enzyme monomer antigenically related to the alpha subunit of the vertebrate enzyme.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.

To understand how fruit development is controlled, we have begun experiments to identify DNA sequences and proteins that regulate gene expression during tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruit ripening. We have focused on the E8 gene because its transcription is responsive to ethylene hormone and is activated at the onset of fruit ripening. We report here that sequences required for ethylene-responsive and developmentally regulated E8 gene expression in transgenic tomato plants are contained on a 4.4 kb restriction fragment which includes sequences 2 kb 5' and 0.5 kb 3' to the gene. In addition, we have identified a DNA-binding factor that specifically interacts with DNA sequences that flank the E8 gene. This DNA-binding activity is low in unripe fruit and increases during fruit ripening. This factor also binds to the 5'-flanking region of another ethylene-responsive gene which is coordinately expressed during tomato fruit ripening. These data suggest that the DNA binding-factor may be involved in the regulation of gene expression during fruit ripening.Images	Interaction of a DNA binding factor with the 5'-flanking region of an ethylene-responsive fruit ripening gene from tomato.

1. A fragment of human subcomponent C1q was prepared by limited proteolysis with pepsin at 37 degrees C for 20 h, and at pH4.4, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. This fragment was shown to contain all the collagen-like features known to be present in the intact molecule [Reid (1976) Biochem. J. 155, 5-17]. 2. Circular-dichroism studies showed the presence of positive bands at 230 and 223 nm in the intact subcomponent C1q and pepsin fragment respectively, compared with a positive band at 220 nm obtained for lathyritic rat skin collagen. These bands were abolished by collagenase treatment, which suggested that there may some collagen-like triple-helical structure in subcomponent C1q and that this structure resides in the pepsin-resistant portion of the molecule. However, the 230 and 223 nm bands had a substantially lower magnitude than that obtained for the unaggregated single fibres of totally triple-helical collagen. 3. Thermal-transition temperatures obtained for subcomponent C1q, the pepsin fragment and the reduced and alkylated pepsin fragment were 48 degrees, 48 degrees and 39 degrees C respectively, compared with a value of 38 degrees C obtained for lathyritic rat skin collagen. 4. Only the unreduced pepsin fragment regained significant amounts (up to 60%) of collagen-like structure, after heat denaturation and cooling, as estimated by circular-dichroism measurements. 5. Electron-microscopy studies of subcomponent C1q and the collagen-like pepsin-resistant fragment of subcomponent C1q showed that the six peripheral globular regions of the molecule were fragmented by pepsin leaving the six collagen-like connecting strands and fibril-like central portion intact.ImagesPLATE 1PLATE 2	Circular-dichroism and electron-microscopy studies of human subcomponent C1q before and after limited proteolysis by pepsin.

The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 108 residues of the B chain of subcomponent C1q of the first component of human complement was determined. The B chain has a blocked N-terminal amino acid, which was judged to be 5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. A collagen-like region of 84 residues was found, which started at position B-6, and all of the six hydroxylysine residues and 12 hydroxyproline residues present in the chain were found in this region. Four of the six hydroxylysine residues may be glycosylated. The repeating nature of the collagen-like region is broken at position B-9, where alanine is found in a position where glycine would be expected. The exact position of the interchain disulphide bond joining the A and B chains of human subcomponent C1q was shown to be between residues A4 and B4.

1. The sequence of the N-terminal 42 amino acid residues and the identity of residue 45 of the C chain of subcomponent C1q were established by the use of the automatic protein sequencer. 2. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the A and C chains of subcomponent C1q shows that they are identical at 18 positions out of the first 45. However, 12 of the amino acid residues in the positions of identity are glycine residues occurring in the repeating triplet sequence Gly-X-Y. 3. Position 36 in the C chain was found to be alanine, which was unexpected since the residue in this position would have to be glycine if the repeating triplet sequence Gly-X-Y were to extend, uniformly, throughout the entire length of the C-chain collagen-like region. This break in the repeating triplet sequence would prevent residue 36 in the C chain from taking part in collagen-like triple-helix formation. 4. The sequence information presented here therefore indicates that there should be a break, or distortion, located approximately half-way along each of the six collagen-like triple-helical regions proposed to be present in subcomponent C1q [Reid & Porter (1976) Biochem. J. 155, 19-23] and this is consistent with what is seen in electron micrographs of intact and pepsin-digested subcomponent C1q.

1. Digestion of human subcomponent C1q with pepsin at pH4.45 for 20h at 37 degrees C fragmented most of the non-collagen-like amino acid sequences in the molecule to small peptides, whereas the entire regions of collagen-like sequence that comprised 38% by weight of the subcomponent C1q were left intact. 2. The collagen-like fraction of the digest was eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 column, was was showm to be composed of two major fragments when examined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels run in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulphate. These fragments were separated on CM-cellulose at pH4.9 in buffers containing 7.5M-urea. 3. Human subcomponent C1q on reduction and alkylation yields equimolar amounnts of three chains, which have been designated A, B and C [Reid et al. (1972) Biochem. J. 130, 749-763]. One of the pepsin fragments was shown to be composed of the N-terminal 95 residues of the A chain linked, via residue A4, by a single disulphide bond to a residue in the sequence B2-B6 in the N-terminal 91 residues of the B chain. The second pepsin fragment was shown to be composed of a disulphide-linked dimer of the N-terminal 94 residues of the C chain, the only disulphide bond being located at residue C4.4. The mol. wts. of the unoxidized and oxidized pepsin fragments were estimated from their amino acid compositions to be 20 000 and 18 200 for the A-B and C-C dimers and 11 400, 8800 and 9600 for the collagen-like fragments of the A, B and C chains respectively. Estimation of the molecular weights of the peptic fragments by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate gave values that were approx. 50% higher than expected from the amino acid sequence data. This is probably due to the high collagen-like sequence content of these fragments.

1. Unreduced human subcomponent C1q was shown by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate to be composed of two types of non-covalently linked subunits of apparent mol.wts. 69 000 and 54 000. The ratio of the two subunits was markedly affected by the ionic strength of the applied sample. At a low ionic strength of applied sample, which gave the optimum value for the 54 000-apparent mol.wt. subunit, a ratio of 1.99:1.00 was obtained for the ratio of the 69 000-apparent mol.wt. subunit to the 5400-apparent-mol.wt. subunit. The amount of the 54 000-apparent-mol.wt. subunit detected in the expected position on the gel was found to be inversely proportional to increases in the ionic strength of the applled sample. 2. Human subcomponent C1q on reduction and alkylation, or oxidation, yields equimolar amounts of three chains designated A, B and C [Reid et al. (1972) Biochem. J. 130, 749-763]. The results obtained by Yonemasu & Stroud [(1972) Immunochemistry 9, 545-554], which showed that the 69 000-apparent-mol.wt. subunit was a disulphide-linked dimer of the A and B chains and that the 54 000-apparent-mol.wt. subunit was a disulphide-linked dimer of the C chain, were confirmed. 3. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in 6.0M-guanidinium chloride showed that both types of unreduced subunit were eluted together as a single symmetrical peak of apparent mol.wt. 49 000-50 000 when globular proteins were used as markers. The molecular weights of the oxidized or reduced A, B and C chains have been shown previously to be very similar all being in the range 23 000-24 000 [Reid et al. (1972) Biochem. J. 130, 749-763; Reid (1974) Biochem. J. 141, 189-203]. 4. It is proposed that subcomponent C1q (mol.wt. 410000) is composed of nine non-covalently linked subunits, i.e. six A-B dimers and three C-C dimers. 5. A structure for subcomponent C1q is proposed and is based on the assumption that the collagen-like regions of 78 residues in each of the A, B and C chains are combined to form a triple-helical structure of the same type as is found in collagens.ImagesPLATE 1PLATE 2	Subunit composition and structure of subcomponent C1q of the first component of human complement.

Glycosylation site binding protein (GSBP) has been shown to be identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; EC 5.3.4.1) in a variety of multicellular organisms. We have utilized immunological and biochemical techniques to determine if GSBP and PDI are identical in yeast. Antiserum prepared against yeast GSBP identified in microsomes by its ability to be labeled with a peptide photoaffinity probe was found to recognize PDI purified from yeast. Moreover, this purified yeast PDI was found to be specifically labeled by the photoaffinity probe originally used to identify GSBP in a variety of eukaryotes. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that yeast GSBP and PDI are the same protein. The structure of the yeast PDI gene revealed a product with sequence similarity to higher eukaryotic PDI/GSBP. Disruption of this gene in yeast resulted in a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that PDI/GSBP is required for cell viability.Images	Glycosylation site binding protein and protein disulfide isomerase are identical and essential for cell viability in yeast.

A family of nuclear proteins, designated SL3-3 enhancer factors 2 (SEF2), were found to interact with an Ephrussi box-like motif within the glucocorticoid response element in the enhancer of the murine leukemia virus SL3-3. Mutation of the DNA sequence decreased the basal enhancer activity in various cell lines. The important nucleotides for binding of SEF2 are conserved in most type C retroviruses. Various cell types displayed differences both in the sets of SEF2-DNA complexes formed and in their amounts. A cDNA which encoded a protein that interacted specifically with the SEF2-binding sequence was isolated from human thymocytes. The nucleotide sequence specificity of the recombinant protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, corresponded to that of at least one of the nuclear SEF2 proteins. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that it belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix class of DNA-binding proteins. Several mRNA transcripts of different sizes were identified. Molecular analysis of cDNA clones revealed multiple related mRNA species containing alternative coding regions, which are most probably a result of differential splicing.Images	Helix-loop-helix transcriptional activators bind to a sequence in glucocorticoid response elements of retrovirus enhancers.

In prior studies we identified a 57-kDa protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum that, in addition to having both protein disulfide isomerase and thyroid hormone-binding protein activities, bound a photoaffinity probe containing the N-glycosylation-site sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr. It was hypothesized that this multifunctional protein, called glycosylation site-binding protein (GSBP), participated in the process of N-glycosylation of proteins. To test this hypothesis we have employed various conditions to deplete the lumen of GSBP and then assess the level of N-glycosylation catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase). Although most conditions leading to depletion resulted in partial loss of OTase activity, this loss was independent of the extent of GSBP depletion. Indeed, virtually complete loss (greater than 99%) of GSBP with partial retention of OTase activity was frequently observed. Moreover, repletion of the microsomal lumen with GSBP did not restore OTase activity to control levels. Thus, no correlation between GSBP content and OTase activity before or after reconstitution was found. These results suggest that this multifunctional 57-kDa protein is not an essential component of the enzymatic reaction in which oligosaccharide chains are transferred from dolichyl-P-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 to nascent polypeptides or to synthetic tripeptide acceptors.Images	Glycosylation site-binding protein is not required for N-linked glycoprotein synthesis.

Prolyl hydroxylase was purified from newborn rats by affinity chromatography using poly(L-proline), and antiserum to the enzyme was prepared in rabbits. The rat prolyl hydroxylase was similar to the chick and human enzymes with respect to specific activity, molecular weight and molecular weights of the polypeptide chains. The activity of prolyl hydroxylase and the content of immunoreactive enzyme were measured in rat liver as a function of age in experimental hepatic injury. Active prolyl hydroxylase comprised about 13.2% of the total immunoreactive protein in the liver of newborn rats and the value decreased to about 3.6% at the age of 420 days. This decrease was due to a decrease in the enzyme activity, whereas only minor changes were found in the content of the immunoreactive protein. In hepatic injury, a significant increase was found in the ratio of active enzyme to total immunoreactive protein, owing to an increase in the enzyme activity. The data indicate that prolyl hydroxylase activity in rat liver is controlled in part by a mechanism which does not involve changes in the content of the total immunoreactive protein.

After severe hepatic injury induced by dimethylnitrosamine, approximately a 4-fold increase in hepatic prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity occurred within 4 days, whereas the increases in total immunoreactive prolyl 4-hydroxylase protein and in prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity were only about 1.4-fold. The different magnitudes of the increases in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and 3-hydroxylase activities were verified after partial purification of the enzymes by gel filtration. The data support previous reports indicating differential increases in the activities of individual enzymes of collagen biosynthesis in hepatic injury. Separation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers from the monomer-size protein by gel filtration indicated that the increase in enzyme activity was similar to that in enzyme tetramers, and an increase had also occurred in the ratio of enzyme tetramers to total enzyme protein. Thus the specific activity of the tetramers had remained unchanged in liver injury. The administration of dimethylnitrosamine was also accompanied by a marked increase in the immunoreactive prolyl 4-hydroxylase protein concentration in the serum, and a similar effect was also noted after carbon tetrachloride administration, results suggesting that the increases originated in the liver.

Prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity, expressed per unit of extract protein, was much higher in rat kidney cortex than in the lung, liver or skin. A marked decrease in activity was found in the kidney cortex, liver and skin beyond 10 days of age. The ratio of prolyl 3-hydroxylase to 4-hydroxylase activity in the kidney cortex was 13--17 times that in the skin, that in the liver 6--8 times, and that in the lung about twice the value for the skin, there being no changes in this ratio with age. In 16-day chick embryos the highest ratios of prolyl 3-hydroxylase to 4-hydroxylase activity were found in the liver, heart, lens, aorta and kidney, and the lowest ratios in tendon, cartilage, cartilaginous and membranous bone and skin. The results suggest that the differences in the extent of prolyl 3-hydroxylation between various collagens can in part be explained by differences in the amount of prolyl e-hydroxylase activity among different cells.

Optimum extraction of collagen galactosyltransferase activity from chick embryos required relatively high concentrations of detergent and salt. The activity was inhibited by concanavalin A, and the enzyme had a high affinity for columns of this lectin coupled to agarose; these results suggest the presence of carbohydrate units in the enzyme molecule. Collagen galactosyltransferase was highly labile, and only 1% of the originally bound enzyme activity could be eluted from the concanavalin A-agarose column with a buffer containing methyl glucoside and ethylene glycol. The purification of the activity over the original supernatant of chick embryo homogenate was 250-300-fold, with the optimum reaction conditions for the purified transferase differing somewhat from those for crude enzyme preparations. The reaction was inhibited by glucose-free basement-membrane collagen, UDP and galactosylhydroxylsine, and also by Co2+ and a number of compounds resembling UDP-galactose. Hydroxylysine was also a weak inhibitor. Immobilized hydroxylysine and UDP-glucuronic acid did not bind the collagen galactosyltransferase, but the enzyme was retarded in a column of UDP-galacturonic acid linked to agarose.

Matrix-free cells from chick-embryo sterna were incubated with various concentrations of 2,2'-bipyridyl, an iron chelator that inhibits prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. At concentrations in the region of 0.1 mM, significant effects on cartilage collagen hydroxylation and secretion were observed. When the underhydroxylated collagens were subsequently digested with chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin plus trypsin at 4 degrees C for 15 min, the minor cartilage collagen precursors (namely types IX and XI) were extensively degraded; type II procollagen was only partially susceptible and was converted into underhydroxylated collagen. The results demonstrate that there were significant differences in triple-helix stability among cartilage collagens such that the underhydroxylated minor collagen precursors were unable to attain a native structure under conditions where type II procollagen was successful.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.

Two pyridinedicarboxylates, predicted [Hanauske-Abel (1983) M.D.-Ph.D. Thesis, Philipps Universität Marburg] and later found to be potent reversible inhibitors of purified prolyl 4-hydroxylase [Majaama, Hanauske-Abel, Günzler & Kivirikko (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 138, 239-245] were investigated with respect to their effect on hydroxyprolyl biosynthesis in the fibroblast/collagen and the macrophage/Clq systems, and the effect was compared with that of the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, the compound usually employed to inhibit cellular hydroxyprolyl formation. Only the enzyme-mechanism-derived pyridinedicarboxylates were highly selective inhibitors, and only they lacked overt cytotoxicity. Morphologically, their effect was restricted to the site of cellular hydroxyprolyl biosynthesis, i.e. the cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. They were equally effective in the different cell types studied, and human and guinea-pig fibroblasts showed the same sensitivity. The minimal lipophilicity of the pyridinedicarboxylates necessitated high concentrations to achieve suppression of cellular hydroxyprolyl formation, but lipophilic bio-activatable pro-inhibitors may overcome this disadvantage. For the first time, experimental evidence is presented suggesting that, in cell culture, the biosynthesis of interstitial collagens and Clq can be suppressed selectively, identifying the pyridinedicarboxylates as promising pilot compounds for experiments in vivo.ImagesFig. 3.Fig. 4.

The relationship between the changes in the four enzyme activities catalysing intracellular post-translational modifications in collagen biosynthesis were studied in rat liver as a function of age and in experimental hepatic injury induced by the administration of dimethylnitrosamine. During aging, relatively large changes were found in prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase activities, whereas only minor changes took place in collagen galactosyltransferase and collagen glucosyltransferase activities. In hepatic injury, the two hydroxylase activities increased earlier and to a larger extent than did the two glycosyltransferase activities, and the largest was found in lysyl hydroxylase activity. The data support previous suggestions that changes in the rate of collagen biosynthesis in the liver cannot be explained simply by a change in the number of collagen-producing cells, but regulation of the enzyme activities existed, so that the two hydroxylase activities altered considerably more than did the two collagen glycosyltransferase activities.

The aim of the work was to identify and characterize the cysteine proteinases of bone tissue, as these enzymes appear necessary for bone resorption. Three cysteine-dependent proteolytic activities were separated from a homogenate of mouse calvaria by a fractionation procedure involving (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The first two are typical cathepsins B and L with respect to (1) their reactivity with anti-(cathepsin B) and anti-(cathepsin L) antibodies respectively, (2) their relative rate constants for inhibition by benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Phe-CHN2 and L-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanid ino)butane and (3) their enzymic properties, such as the higher activities of cathepsin L against collagen and gelatin as compared with cathepsin B, and the fact that benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide is hydrolysed only by cathepsin B. Cathepsin L was mainly recovered in its precursor form, as indicated by its apparent 40 kDa molecular mass and its relative stability at pH 7.2. The third enzyme is a cathepsin L-like proteinase with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. It is immunoprecipitated by anti-(cathepsin L) antibodies, and appears as the 25 kDa band of mature cathepsin L in Western blots. It further resembles (pro)cathepsin L with regard to its activities against synthetic substrates and proteins such as collagen, and with regard to its response to various inhibitors. However, unlike (pro)cathepsin L, it is eluted as a 70 kDa protein on gel filtration (even in the presence of 1% Brij or 1 M-NaCl), it is stable at pH values as high as 9, and it exhibits stronger affinity for phenyl-Sepharose. It might thus result from a strong complex between mature cathepsin L and another entity that confers stability at alkaline pH and favours hydrophobic interactions. This 70 kDa activity was also detected in mouse muscle and long bones of Ca(2+)-deficient chicks but not in mouse liver, spleen or kidney.ImagesFig. 5.

Cathepsin B is a lysosomal thiol proteinase that may have additional extralysosomal functions. To further our investigations on the structure, mode of biosynthesis, and intracellular sorting of this enzyme, we have determined the complete coding sequences for human and mouse preprocathepsin B by using cDNA clones isolated from human hepatoma and kidney phage libraries. The nucleotide sequences predict that the primary structure of preprocathepsin B contains 339 amino acids organized as follows: a 17-residue NH2-terminal prepeptide sequence followed by a 62-residue propeptide region, 254 residues in mature (single chain) cathepsin B, and a 6-residue extension at the COOH terminus. A comparison of procathepsin B sequences from three species (human, mouse, and rat) reveals that the homology between the propeptides is relatively conserved with a minimum of 68% sequence identity. In particular, two conserved sequences in the propeptide that may be functionally significant include a potential glycosylation site and the presence of a single cysteine at position 59. Comparative analysis of the three sequences also suggests that processing of procathepsin B is a multistep process, during which enzymatically active intermediate forms may be generated. The availability of the cDNA clones will facilitate the identification of possible active or inactive intermediate processive forms as well as studies on the transcriptional regulation of the cathepsin B gene.

Human liver cathepsin L consists of a heavy chain and a light chain with Mr values of 25,000 and 5000 respectively. The chains have been purified and their N-terminal amino acid sequences have been determined. The 40 amino acids determined from the heavy chain and 42 amino acids sequenced in the light chain are homologous with the N-terminal and C-terminal regions respectively of the superfamily of cysteine proteinases. Therefore it is likely that the two chains of cathepsin L are derived by proteolysis of a single polypeptide precursor. Of the amino acids sequenced, 81% are identical with the homologous portions of a protein sequence for a major cysteine proteinase predicted from a cDNA clone from a mouse macrophage cell line. This is the closest relative amongst the known sequences in the superfamily and strongly indicates that the protein encoded by this mRNA is cathepsin L. The mouse protein is also probably the major excreted protein of a transformed cell line [Gal & Gottesman (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 139, 156-162]. The heavy chain is identical in only 71% of its residues with the sequence of ox cathepsin S, providing further evidence that this latter enzyme is probably not a species variant of cathepsin L. The relationship with a second unidentified cathepsin cDNA clone from a bovine library is much weaker (41% identity), and so this clone remains unidentified.ImagesFig. 1.

We have separated four cathepsins (B, L, N and S) from rabbit spleen. They are all collagen-degrading cysteine proteinases, with Mr values of 25,250, 23,500, 34,000 and 30,000 for cathepsin B, L, N and S respectively. Cathepsins B, N and S have isoelectric points of 5.4, 6.2 and 6.8 respectively, whereas cathepsin L exhibited multiple charge forms in the range 5.0-5.7. A comparison of their specific activity against a variety of protein and synthetic substrates shows many differences. These differences can be visually illustrated through isoelectric focusing and detection of enzymic activity with protein and synthetic-substrate overlays. By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the binding to chicken cystatin and detection with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to native cathepsins B and L, no cross-reactivity of the four native enzymes was observed. Studies on the co-operative or synergistic effect in degrading collagen indicated that, of the different combinations tested, only the combination of cathepsin B and N exhibited enhanced collagenolysis.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.

"From the lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin B, isolated from human liver in its two-chain form, monoclinic crystals were obtained which contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. The molecular structure was solved by a combination of Patterson search and heavy atom replacement methods (simultaneously with rat cathepsin B) and refined to a crystallographic R value of 0.164 using X-ray data to 2.15 A resolution. The overall folding pattern of cathepsin B and the arrangement of the active site residues are similar to the related cysteine proteinases papain, actinidin and calotropin DI. 166 alpha-carbon atoms out of 248 defined cathepsin B residues are topologically equivalent (with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.04 A) with alpha-carbon atoms of papain. However, several large insertion loops are accommodated on the molecular surface and modify its properties. The disulphide connectivities recently determined for bovine cathepsin B by chemical means were shown to be correct. Some of the primed subsites are occluded by a novel insertion loop, which seems to favour binding of peptide substrates with two residues carboxy-terminal to the scissile peptide bond; two histidine residues (His110 and His111) in this ""occluding loop' provide positively charged anchors for the C-terminal carboxylate group of such polypeptide substrates. These structural features explain the well-known dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B. The other subsites adjacent to the reactive site Cys29 are relatively similar to papain; Glu245 in the S2 subsite favours basic P2-side chains. The above mentioned histidine residues, but also the buried Glu171 might represent the group with a pKa of approximately 5.5 near the active site, which governs endo- and exopeptidase activity. The ""occluding loop' does not allow cystatin-like protein inhibitors to bind to cathepsin B as they do to papain, consistent with the reduced affinity of these protein inhibitors for cathepsin B compared with the related plant enzymes.Images"	The refined 2.15 A X-ray crystal structure of human liver cathepsin B: the structural basis for its specificity.

This paper describes a plasmid vector for cloning cDNAs in Escherichia coli; the same vector also promotes expression of the cDNA segment in mammalian cells. Simian virus 40 (SV40)-derived DNA segments are arrayed in the pcD vector to permit transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation of the cloned cDNA segment. A DNA fragment containing both the SV40 early region promoter and two introns normally used to splice the virus 16S and 19S late mRNAs is placed upstream of the cDNA cloning site to ensure transcription and splicing of the cDNA transcripts. An SV40 late region polyadenylation sequence occurs downstream of the cDNA cloning site, so that the cDNA transcript acquires a polyadenylated 3' end. By using pcD-alpha-globin cDNA as a model, we confirmed that the alpha-globin transcript produced in transfected cells is initiated correctly, spliced at either of the two introns, and polyadenylated either at the site coded in the cDNA segment or at the distal SV40 polyadenylation signal. A cDNA clone library constructed with mRNA from SV40-transformed human fibroblasts and this vector (about 1.4 X 10(6) clones) yielded full-length cDNA clones that express hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Jolly et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press).Images	A cDNA cloning vector that permits expression of cDNA inserts in mammalian cells.	H Okayama, P Berg	6300662	1983-02-01	17	
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) synthesis is regulated in a growth-dependent fashion. Dividing cells synthesize DHFR at a 10-fold-higher rate than do stationary cells. To study this growth-dependent synthesis. DHFR genes have been constructed from a DHFR cDNA segment, the adenovirus major late promoter, and fragments of simian virus 40 (SV40) which provide signals for polyadenylation. These genes have been introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The DHFR mRNAs produced in different transformants are identical at their 5' ends, but differ in sequences in their 3' ends as different sites are utilized for polyadenylation. Three transformants that utilize either DHFR polyadenylation signals or the SV40 late polyadenylation signal exhibit growth-dependent DHFR synthesis. The level of DHFR mRNA in growing cells is approximately 10 times that in stationary cells for these transformants. This growth-dependent DHFR mRNA production probably results from posttranscriptional events. In contrast, three transformants that utilize the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and another transformant that utilizes a cellular polyadenylation signal do not exhibit growth-dependent DHFR synthesis. In these three cell lines, the fraction of mRNAs polyadenylated at different sites in a tandem array shifts between growing and stationary cells. These results suggest that the metabolic state of the cell is important in determining either the efficiency of polyadenylation at various sites or the stability of mRNA polyadenylated at various sites.Images	Growth-dependent expression of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA from modular cDNA genes.

A transcription unit at the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 transforming region, mtr-2 (map coordinates 0.580-0.625), comprises two early, unspliced mRNAs of 4.5 kb and 1.2 kb which are 3' co-terminal; a region including that specifying the 1.2-kb mRNA has been sequenced. The putative translated portions of these two mRNAs do not overlap and this feature, together with the arrangement of the mRNAs, is similar to the apparently equivalent co-linear HSV-1 locus which however does not transform. A putative stem and loops structure containing a TATA box is located upstream from the 5' terminus of the 1.2-kb mRNA within the translated portion of the 4.5-kb mRNA. Evidence for the generation of this structure by intra-strand reassociation under our hybridisation conditions has been obtained and possibilities are that it may function as a transcription-activated promoter or as an RNA polymerase pause site. A comparison of the equivalent HSV-2 and HSV-1 regions reveals a conserved sequence downstream from the 3' co-terminus which is present at a similar location in many eukaryotic genes (consensus sequence YGTGTTYY). The overall sequence conservation at this transcription unit is high except for regions located at: (1) the untranslated leaders of the 1.2-kb mRNAs; (2) the N termini of the polypeptides specified by the HSV-2/HSV-1 1.2-kb mRNAs; (3) the intergenic region beyond the 3' co termini. Regions (2) and (3) are located within a transforming fragment of HSV-2. The possible significance of these data for HSV-mediated cell transformation is discussed.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

The results of immunocytochemical studies using two different monoclonal antibodies against the M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase show an exclusively cytoplasmic localization of this subunit both in cultured MDBK and mouse 3T6 cells, and in cells from various rat tissues. By fluorescent light microscopy, there is a diffuse staining of the cytoplasm, while by electron microscopy the immunoreactive material appears to be associated with ribosomes. In the rat tissues, only actively dividing cells show M1-specific immunofluorescence revealing a strong correlation between the presence of protein M1 and DNA synthesis. Therefore M1 immunofluorescence could be used to study cell proliferation in normal, inflammatory or neoplastic tissue. A lesser variation in M1 staining is observed between individual cells in tissue culture, where most cells are positive, but neither here nor in the tissues examined are any cells with nuclear staining detected. We interpret our results to mean that in mammalian cells ribonucleotide reduction takes place in the cytoplasm and from there the deoxyribonucleotides are transported into the nucleus to serve in DNA synthesis.ImagesFig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

In both clam oocytes and sea urchin eggs, fertilization triggers the synthesis of a set of proteins specified by stored maternal mRNAs. One of the most abundant of these (p41) has a molecular weight of 41,000. This paper describes the identification of p41 as the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme that provides the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis. This identification is based mainly on the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA clones corresponding to p41, which shows homology with a gene in Herpes Simplex virus that is thought to encode the small subunit of viral ribonucleotide reductase. Comparison with the B2 (small) subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase also shows striking homology in certain conserved regions of the molecule. However, our attention was originally drawn to protein p41 because it was specifically retained by an affinity column bearing the monoclonal antibody YL 1/2, which reacts with alpha-tubulin (Kilmartin, J. V., B. Wright, and C. Milstein, 1982, J. Cell Biol., 93:576-582). The finding that this antibody inhibits the activity of sea urchin embryo ribonucleotide reductase confirmed the identity of p41 as the small subunit. The unexpected binding of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase can be accounted for by its carboxy-terminal sequence, which matches the specificity requirements of YL 1/2 as determined by Wehland et al. (Wehland, J., H. C. Schroeder, and K. Weber, 1984, EMBO [Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.] J., 3:1295- 1300). Unlike the small subunit, there is no sign of synthesis of a corresponding large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase after fertilization. Since most enzymes of this type require two subunits for activity, we suspect that the unfertilized oocytes contain a stockpile of large subunits ready for combination with newly made small subunits. Thus, synthesis of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase represents a very clear example of the developmental regulation of enzyme activity by control of gene expression at the level of translation.

We have analyzed the expression of endogenous histone H4 genes and of a newly introduced H4 gene in 21-Tb cells, a mouse mastocytoma cell-cycle mutant. Endogenous H4 mRNAs were less abundant by a factor of 120-180 in G1-arrested than in exponentially multiplying cells. However, H4 transcription rates were only decreased by a factor of 3 under these conditions, as determined by in vitro elongation of nascent transcripts. This indicates that post-transcriptional control of histone mRNA levels is important, in accord with published data. We introduced a mouse H4 gene, modified by a 12-base-pair (bp) insertion in its coding sequence, into 21-Tb cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. The levels of transcripts from this gene were regulated in parallel with those of the endogenous genes. Moreover, fusion of the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter to a 463-bp fragment containing the 3'-terminal half of the mouse H4 gene, including 230 bp of spacer sequences, led to the regulated expression of SV40/H4 fusion RNA. However, a small proportion of SV40-initiated transcripts were not processed to histone-specific 3' ends, but extended farther through the downstream Escherichia coli galactokinase gene to a SV40 polyadenylylation site. In contrast to the short SV40/H4 RNA, the levels of these longer transcripts were not reduced in G1-arrested cells. These results show that sequences in the 3'-terminal part of the H4 gene can regulate gene expression in the cell cycle, presumably at the post-transcriptional level, as long as they are not positioned much more distant from the terminus than normal.Images	Faithful cell-cycle regulation of a recombinant mouse histone H4 gene is controlled by sequences in the 3'-terminal part of the gene.

Methotrexate(MTX)-resistant human promyelocytic-leukaemia cells (HL-60) derived from MTX-sensitive cells have a 20-fold increase in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity as compared with the sensitive cells. This increase is not associated with a concomitant increase in DHFR protein as determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and by immunological methods using mouse anti-DHFR antibody. The rate of DHFR synthesis is similar in both cell lines. Furthermore, both the sensitive and resistant cells have similar amounts of RNA hybridizing to a DHFR complementary-DNA probe, correlating well with the lack of increase in DHFR protein. DHFR-gene dosages were similar in both types of cells. We conclude that the 20-fold increase in DHFR activity present in these MTX-resistant cells is not due to the overproduction of DHFR but due to the expression of a more active form of the enzyme.ImagesFig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.

The rapidly-labeled polyribosomal RNA component from mouse sarcoma 180 cells is retained on nitrocellulose (Millipore) membrane-filters at high ionic strength. This property is due to the presence of a polynucleotide sequence rich in adenylic acid that resists both T1 and pancreatic RNase digestion. The resistant material shows sedimentation characteristics close to those of transfer RNA. The RNA molecules that contain this material can be separated from the rest of the polysomal RNA by differential phenol extraction with neutral and alkaline Tris buffers. Synthetic poly(A) exhibits the same behavior as the rapidly-labeled polysomal RNA with respect to Millipore binding and phenol fractionation. The characteristics of the rapidly-labeled polysomal RNA component permit its isolation free of ribosomal RNA.

Polyadenylate sequences have been found covalently linked in heterogeneous DNA-like nuclear RNA of HeLa cells. This poly(A) material seems homogeneous in size and accounts for about 0.5% of such RNA. Similar poly(A) sequences were found in rapidly-labeled polyribosomal RNA, thought to be messenger RNA. A possible model for mRNA synthesis from large heterogeneous nuclear RNA precursor molecules is discussed.

Small amounts of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA direct a 50-fold increase in amino acid incorporation, in appropriately supplemented ascites tumor cell extracts, under conditions that give rise to authentic viral polypeptides. Incorporation in these crude extracts has a novel characteristic, namely, that it is almost entirely dependent upon the addition of exogenous tRNA. Further, this incorporation is restricted in that tRNA derived from ascites tumor cells or from rat liver permits translation of viral RNA, whereas tRNA from yeast or Escherichia coli does not. These translational barriers are due, at least in part, to an incompatibility between the tRNA of yeast and E. coli and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of the ascites tumor cell. A more extensive basis for this incompatibility is suggested, however, by the failure of the E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to restore viral RNA-directed protein synthesis in the presence of tRNA from E. coli, although the coli synthetases fully restore the poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenyl-alanine. The possible role that unique or favored codon classes might play in this restriction is considered, together with the implications of the observed requirement for tRNA.

Several properties of the viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases and of rabbit globin mRNA make it possible to consider synthesis of the globin gene in vitro. These enzymes copy an RNA template using a short sequence of complementary nucleotides as a primer. Furthermore, globin mRNA has a 3′-terminal sequence of adenylic acid residues that make it particularly suitable as a template, since oligo(dT) can be annealed to a specific site on the mRNA. This small primer could phase the DNA polymerase, possibly ensuring that replication is initiated from that end of the globin message. We have used this approach and find that purified mRNA is an efficient template for the polymerase enzyme. The reaction requires the RNA template and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and it is markedly stimulated by the addition of oligo(dT). Consistent with the expectation that the oligo(dT) uniquely phases the polymerase at an adenine-rich region in the globin message, oligo(dG), oligo(dC), and oligo(dA) fail to serve as primers. The product has a density intermediate between that of DNA and RNA, and shifts to a lighter DNA density after treatment with base. Further, it is specifically complementary to globin mRNA and sediments slightly faster in an alkaline sucrose gradient than a DNA standard that has a molecular weight of 129,000. The data suggest that a major portion of the DNA product is a sequence of at least 500 bases, about 50 more than would be necessary to encode rabbit globin. The potential usefulness of this interesting product is discussed.Images	In Vitro Synthesis of DNA Complementary to Purified Rabbit Globin mRNA	Jeffrey Ross, Haim Aviv, Edward Scolnick, Philip Leder	4333043	1972-01-01	17	
The turnover of prolyl hydroxylase and an immunoreactive protein that corresponds in size to the smaller subunit of the enzyme was studied in vivo after injection of [3H]leucine into 11-day chick embryos. The specific radioactivity and total radioactivity of the monomer-size protein were much higher than those of the enzyme tetramers in the cartilaginous bone at 3h and 12h after the radioisotope injection, indicating that the monomer-size protein represents precursors rather than degradation products of the enzyme tetramers. Between 24 and 144h after the injection the specific radioactivity and total radioactivity of the two forms of the enzyme protein showed essentially identical decay rates, the observed specific radioactivity of the monomer-size protein being about 120–130% and total radioactivity about 80% of that of the enzyme tetramers. The true half-life, when corrected for dilution caused by tissue growth and re-utilization of the [3H]leucine, was 37.9h for the monomer-size protein and 39.0h for the tetramers. The results obtained in the lung were less reliable owing to high blank radioactivity values in the immunoprecipitation, but even so some definite differences were found between this tissue and the cartilaginous bone. The specific radioactivity of both forms of the enzyme protein at 24h was only about 20–25% of that in the cartilaginous bone. The total radioactivity of the monomer-size protein in the lung remained about 5 times that of the enzyme tetramers, whereas it was only about 0.8 times that of the tetramers in the cartilaginous bone. As in the cartilaginous bone, the decay rates of both forms of the enzyme protein were essentially identical in the lung, with a true half-life of about 46h. The results suggest that the rate of prolyl hydroxylase synthesis is slower in the lung than in the cartilaginous bone, whereas the degradation rates are fairly similar in these two tissues. The data further suggest that, in the lung at least, a large part of the monomer-size protein became degraded without being converted into enzyme tetramers.

Embryonic-chick tendon cells were incubated in suspension for 4h with 14C-labelled amino acids, cell extracts were subjected to gel filtration, and the effluent was examined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis by using antibodies specific for the β-subunit of chick prolyl hydroxylase. Two peaks of immunoreactive protein were found. The first peak contained 40% of the immunoreactive protein eluted from the column and 100% of the enzyme activity. Polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate of an immunoprecipitate of this peak demonstrated that it consisted of the tetrameric form of prolyl hydroxylase, subunit composition α2β2 where α and β are non-identical subunits. Only the α-subunits were labelled, indicating that they were synthesized during the 4h labelling period. The β-subunits were unlabelled, indicating that they had been synthesized before the labelling period. The second peak eluted from the gel-filtration column contained 60% of the immunoreactive protein eluted from the column and was enzymically inactive. Polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis of an immunoprecipitate of this peak indicated that it consisted of a single labelled polypeptide chain, identified as cross-reacting protein, which was related to, but not identical with, the β-subunit of prolyl hydroxylase. Pulse–chase experiments were performed on cultured chick tendon cells to demonstrate that α-subunits and cross-reacting protein had half-lives of about 60h. The half-life of β-subunits was considerably longer, and the kinetic pattern was consistent with their being derived from a labelled precursor such as cross-reacting protein. The data presented here indicate that the active tetrameric form of prolyl hydroxylase in cells is assembled from α-subunits which are newly synthesized, and from β-subunits which are derived from cross-reacting protein.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.

The construction, identification, and use of a recombinant DNA clone containing a growth hormone structural gene sequence is described. A cDNA copy of partially purified pregrowth hormone mRNA from cultured rat pituitary tumor (GC) cells was employed in the construction of a hybrid plasmid, designated pBR322-GH1. The cloned DNA sequence was positively identified by a hybridization-translation procedure which should be applicable to any cloned structural gene sequence. This procedure involved hybridization of cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA from GC cells to the cloned DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters, followed by elution of the hybridized RNA and translation in a mRNA-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Physical and immunological criteria were employed to show that the translation products were enriched for pregrowth hormone. Hybridization to excess plasmid DNA of [3H]uridine-labeled, size fractionated GC cell cytoplasmic RNA was used to show that all growth hormone-specific RNA sequences are the same size as functional pregrowth hormone mRNA.Images	Construction and identification by positive hybridization-translation of a bacterial plasmid containing a rat growth hormone structural gene sequence.

A method is presented for the purification of mRNAs and the identification of structural gene sequences in recombinant DNA molecules. RNA is hybridized to double-stranded linear DNA such that R-loops are formed between most DNAs and their complementary RNA sequences. These R-loops are purified from unhybridized RNAs by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of a high concentration of salt. The complementary RNAs are released from the R-loops by heating, and are assayed by gel electrophoresis or cell free translation to determine their purity and to identify the proteins for which they code. We have demonstrated that recombinant DNAs containing sequences for abundant or moderately abundant mRNAs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be identified by this means.Images	The use of R-looping for structural gene identification and mRNA purification.

An mRNA fraction coding for hexon polypeptide, the major virion structural protein, was purified by gel electrophoresis from extracts of adenovirus 2-infected cells late in the lytic cycle. The mRNA sequences in this fraction were mapped between 51.7 and 61.3 units on the genome by visualizing RNA-DNA hybrids in the electron microscope. When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope,branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5' terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5' tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA. Thus, four segments of viral RNA may be joined together during the synthesis of mature hexon mRNA. A model is presented for adenovirus late mRNA synthesis that involves multiple splicing during maturation of a larger precursor nuclear RNA.Images	Spliced segments at the 5' terminus of adenovirus 2 late mRNA.

A method is described for the preparation isolation of highly purified adenovirus RNA species. Cytoplasmic RNAs from cells infected with adenovirus 2 were selected by hybridization to viral DNA fragments bound to nitrocellulose membranes. A series of washes at elevated temperatures (50-70 degrees) determined conditions at which the true hybrids were stable but non-specific RNA was removed. This temperature has been found to correlate with the base composition of the DNA fragment. After washing at this predetermined temperature, the specific RNA was eluted at 85 degrees. The purity of the eluted RNA was greater than 95% as determined by size, sequence specificity, and template activity in an in vitro protein synthesizing system. The method described should be generally useful for purification of specific RNAs.Images	Purification of specific adenovirus 2 RNAs by preparative hybridization and selective thermal elution.

Cytoplasmic RNA, isolated from cells late after infection by adenovirus type 2 and fractionated by hybridization to specific fragments of adenovirus DNA produced by cleavage with the endonuclease R-EcoRI, was used as template for protein synthesis in cell-free mammalian extracts. Each of the R-EcoRI fragments of DNA selects RNA that encodes specific subsets of the viral polypeptides. From the known order of the R-EcoRI fragments, the following partial map is deduced: (III, IIIa, IVa2, V, P-VII, IX), (II, P-VI), 100K, IV-where the relative order of the components enclosed in parentheses has not yet been determined.Images	Mapping of late adenovirus genes by cell-free translation of RNA selected by hybridization to specific DNA fragments.

With oligo(dT)-cellulose as primer, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase catalyzes the synthesis of cellulose-bound DNA that is complementary to mouse globin mRNA. The resulting cellulose-bound or solid phase complementary DNA hybridizes specifically with globin mRNA and permits the recovery of intact globin mRNA. This simple technique for the synthesis of solid phase-bound complementary DNA provides an additional and convenient method for the purification of specific genetic sequences.Images	Enzymatic Synthesis of Solid Phase-Bound DNA Sequences Corresponding to Specific Mammalian Genes	Pal Venetianer, Philip Leder	4139705	1974-10-01	17	
Hybridization to the separated light (L) and heavy (H) strands of adenovirus 2 DNA in 50% formamide at 37° was used to isolate undegraded virus-specific RNA molecules from the polyribosomes of cycloheximide-treated human KB cells early after infection with adenovirus 2. About 20% of polyribosomal RNA labeled with [3H]uridine from 4 to 7 hr after infection was virus-specific. Twice as much labeled RNA was homologous to the L strand as to the H strand. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA selected with unfractionated adenovirus DNA resolved a major component of virus-specific RNA in the 19-20 S region of the gel and smaller amounts of viral RNA in two heterogeneous fractions migrating at 15-18 S and 21-26 S. Selection with individual DNA strands showed that the 19-20 S main size class of early mRNA consists of two homogeneous RNA species with slightly different mobilities, the transcripts from the L and H strand having molecular weights of 7.4 × 105 and 7.7 × 105, respectively. The 15-18 S RNA hybridized with the L strand and the 21-26 S RNA with the H strand.

Changes in the regulation of collagen post-translational modification in transformed cells were studied in three established human sarcoma cell lines and in chick-embryo fibroblasts freshly transformed by Rous sarcoma virus. The collagens synthesized by all but one of these and by all the control human and chick-embryo cell lines were almost exclusively of types I and/or III. The relative rate of collagen synthesis and the amounts of prolyl hydroxylase activity and immunoreactive protein were markedly low in all the transformed human cell lines. The other enzymes studied, lysyl hydroxylase, hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase, never showed as large a decrease in activity as did prolyl hydroxylase, suggesting a more efficient regulation of the last enzyme than of the three others. The chick-embryo fibroblasts freshly transformed by Rous sarcoma virus differed from the human sarcoma cells in that prolyl hydroxylase activity was distinctly increased, whereas the decreases in immunoreactive prolyl hydroxylase protein and the three other enzyme activities were very similar to those in the simian-virus-40-transformed human fibroblasts. It seems possible that this increased prolyl hydroxylase activity is only a temporary phenomenon occurring shortly after the transformation, and may be followed by a decrease in activity later. The newly synthesized collagens of all the transformed cells that produced almost exclusively collagen types I and/or III had high extents of lysyl hydroxylation, and there was also an increase in the ratio of glycosylated to non-glycosylated hydroxylysine. The data suggest that one critical factor affecting modification is the rate of collagen synthesis, which affects the ratio of enzyme to substrate in the cell.

Prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity and the extent of collagen proline 3-hydroxylation were studied in six transformed and three control human cell lines. In the transformed cell lines, the enzyme activity was markedly high in two, similar to that in control cells in two and significantly low in two. The extent of proline 3-hydroxylation was markedly high in cell lines with high enzyme activity, but it was also significantly high in some transformed cell lines with enzyme activities similar to those in the controls. The results thus suggest that, in addition to the amount of enzyme activity present, the rate of collagen synthesis also affects the extent of proline 3-hydroxylation in the newly synthesized collagen. The effect of acute cell transformation on prolyl 3-hydroxylase and 4-hydroxylase activities was studied by infecting chick-embryo fibroblasts with Rous sarcoma virus mutant NY68, temperature-sensitive for transformation. At the permissive temperature prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity showed a more rapid increase and decrease than did prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, the maximal activity for both enzymes being about 2.5 times that in the control chick fibroblasts. When the transformed cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature the decays in the elevated enzyme activities were similar, suggesting identical half-lives.

The labelling of the subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers was studied in freshly isolated chick-embryo tendon cells and in chick-embryo tissues. In the former both the alpha- and beta-subunits of the tetramer were labelled during a 4 h labelling and 2 h chase period, although the radioactivity in the beta-subunit was much lower than in the alpha-subunit. The corresponding subunits of the enzyme from 12-day chick-embryo cartilaginous bone and heart were labelled in 7 h, again the beta-subunit much less than the alpha-subunit, the ratio of radioactivity in the beta-subunit to that in the alpha-subunit (beta/alpha-radioactivity) being 0.20 and 0.32 respectively. The beta/alpha-radioactivity then increased almost linearily with time between 7 and 24 h, by 9.5-fold in the cartilaginous bone and 3-fold in the heart, and beta/alpha-radioactivity values above 1.0 were reached. The free beta-subunit-size protein (the beta'-protein), which is also present in cells, had been labelled quite heavily by 7 h. The beta/alpha-radioactivity at 7h, determined in four tissues with different ratios of prolyl hydroxylase tetramers to total immunoreactive protein (tetramer percentage), was low in tissues with a high tetramer percentage. It is thus proposed that only a minor fraction of the beta'-protein must be processed to the tetrameric beta-subunit and utilized in the synthesis of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers.ImagesFig. 1.

A cDNA library of approximately equal to 9,000 members has been prepared from chicken smooth muscle mRNA by using the plasmid expression vector pUC8. Addition of Sal I and EcoRI linkers at different stages during the preparation of the cDNA resulted in a population of molecules, most of which had EcoRI linkers at the end of the cDNA that corresponded to the 5' end of the template mRNA and Sal I linkers at the end that corresponded to the 3' end of the mRNA. The cDNA molecules then were inserted into a EcoRI-Sal I-cut plasmid vector, pUC8, that contains the transcriptional and translational start sequences from the lacZ gene upstream of the EcoRI site. The sequential addition of the linkers to the cDNA ensured that most of the cDNAs were inserted into pUC8 in the proper orientation for expression. The colonies were replica plated onto nitrocellulose filters and lysed in situ with chloroform vapor. The library was screened for colonies producing products immunologically related to chicken tropomyosin by incubating the filters first with a rabbit antitropomyosin antibody and second with a 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Two colonies were detected that reacted specifically with the antisera. Plasmids from both clones have been partially subjected to sequence analysis; both plasmids contain cDNAs that encode tropomyosin. These protocols are potentially useful for the identification of cDNA clones for genes expressed at low levels from large cDNA expression libraries.Images	Identification of clones that encode chicken tropomyosin by direct immunological screening of a cDNA expression library.

We have developed a bacteriophage lambda cloning vector, lambda ORF8, that can be used for the construction of cDNA libraries. The wild-type lambda genome contains five BamHI, five EcoRI, and seven HindIII restriction sites that have all been removed from the genome of lambda ORF8. Sites for these endonucleases are present within the multiple cloning site of lambda ORF8. We report a method for preparing cDNAs that can be cloned in a single orientation in our phage vector. The method utilizes the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, including priming of first-strand synthesis by oligo(dT). After completion of second-strand synthesis, a bifunctional oligodeoxynucleotide linker is ligated to the cDNA fragments. This linker, which contains a BamHI restriction site, will create a HindIII restriction site when ligated to the 3' end of cDNA fragments. Subsequent treatment of methylated cDNA with HindIII and BamHI endonucleases allows these fragments to be cloned directionally into lambda ORF8. To demonstrate the utility of this cloning system, we prepared a library from 5 micrograms of mRNA isolated from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The primary library contained 2 X 10(8) plaque-forming phage, at least 80% of which contain inserts. A portion of the library was examined for the presence of gamma-interferon-related clones to verify the method had generated a library that was representative of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. This simple and efficient cDNA cloning system significantly reduces the amount of RNA and effort required for the preparation of large directionally cloned libraries.Images	Bacteriophage lambda cloning system for the construction of directional cDNA libraries.

Mouse myeloma cells secreting 19S IgM (immunoglobulin M) (MOPC 104E and TEPC 183) or monomer and polymer IgA (immunoglobulin A) (MOPC 315) were incubated with radioactive leucine and the intracellular and secreted immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin subunits were prepared by preparative sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. Samples were reduced in the presence or absence of isolated J chain, passed over Sephadex G-25 and then incubated at 37°C for 30min with or without a source of disulphide-interchange enzyme. The extent of reassembly of reduced subunits was then evaluated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. Provided that J chain and the disulphide-interchange enzyme were supplied, both IgM and IgA could be assembled from their respective subunits, obtained by reductive cleavage of polymeric forms. Under similar conditions, assembly of polymeric forms from intracellular or secreted 7S monomer subunits also occurred. Under these conditions polymerization was total, there being no residue of the monomeric form. Reassembly did not occur in the absence of either J chain or the enzyme. All of the J chain released from IgM by reductive cleavage was incorporated back into the reassembled polymer. The J chain is therefore likely to be an essential structural requirement for polymeric immunoglobulins. A variety of controls ruled out non-specific interactions, and further suggested that the amino acid sequence of polypeptide chains determines the specificity of polymerization. The fact that intracellular IgA and IgM monomer subunits known to be deficient in galactose and fucose can be completely polymerized suggests that the addition of carbohydrate does not control polymerization.ImagesFig. 7.

A new plot is described for analysing the results of kinetic experiments in which the Michaelis–Menten equation is obeyed. Observations are plotted as lines in parameter space, instead of points in observation space. With appropriate modifications the plot is applicable to most problems of interest to the enzyme kineticist. It has the following advantages over traditional methods of plotting kinetic results: it is very simple to construct, because it is composed entirely of straight lines and requires no calculation or mathematical tables; the kinetic constants are read off the plot directly, again without calculation; it may be used during the course of an experiment to judge the success of the experiment, and to modify the experimental design; it provides clear and accurate information about the quality of the observations, and identifies aberrant observations; it provides a clear indication of the precision of the kinetic constants; constructed with care, it provides unbiased estimates of the kinetic constants, the same as those provided by a computer program; it may be used to simulate results for illustrative purposes very rapidly and simply.

1. Protein disulphide-isomerase and glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase activities were assayed in parallel through a conventional purification of protein disulphide-isomerase from ox liver. 2. Throughout a series of purification steps (differential centrifugation, acetone extraction, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography), the two activities appeared in the same fractions but were purified to different extents. 3. The final sample was 143-fold purified in protein disulphide-isomerase but only 10-fold purified in glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase; nevertheless the two activities in this preparation were not resolved by high-resolution isoelectric focusing and both showed pI4.65. 4. In a partially purified preparation containing both activities, glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase was far more sensitive to heat denaturation than was protein disulphide-isomerase; conversely protein disulphide-isomerase was more sensitive to inactivation by deoxycholate. 5. The data are inconsistent with a single enzyme being responsible for all the protein disulphide-isomerase and glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase activity of ox liver. It is suggested that several similiar thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductases of overlapping specificities may better account for the data.	Thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductases.

1. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity towards 12 substrates has been assessed in rat liver during the perinatal period. 2. Between days 16 and 20 of gestation, enzyme activities towards the substrates 2-aminophenol, 2-aminobenzoate, 4-nitrophenol, 1-naphthol, 4-methylumbelliferone and 5-hydroxytryptamine (the 'late foetal' group) surge to reach adult values, while activities towards bilirubin, testosterone, beta-oestradiol, morphine, phenolphthalein, and chloramphenicol (the 'neonatal' group) remain negligible or at less than 10% of adult values. 3. By the second postnatal day, enzyme activities towards the neonatal group have attained, or approached adult values. 4. Dexamethasone precociously stimulates in 17-day foetal liver in utero transferase activities in the late foetal, but not the neonatal group. A similar inductive pattern is found for 15-day foetal liver in organ culture. 5. It is suggested that foetal glucocorticoids, whose synthesis markedly increases between days 16 and 20 of gestation, are responsibile for triggering the simultaneous surge of all the hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities in the late foetal group. The neonatal group of activities apparently require a different or additional stimulus for their appearance. 6. The relationship of these two groups of transferase activities to other similar groups observed during induction by xenobiotics and enzyme purification is discussed.

After the administration of 3-methylcholanthrene to adult male rats, activities of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase towards six from a group of 12 substrates were stimulated by 250-350%. Activities towards the remaining six substrates were unaffected. Conversely, after phenobarbital administration, activities formerly stimulated by 3-methylcholanthrene remained unchanged, and the other six activities were stimulated by 160-280%. The relationship of these two groups of transferase activities to other evidence suggesting the same heterogeneity of the enzyme is discussed.

Monomeric intracellular mouse immunoglobulin M (hereafter designated IgMs) was purified in milligram quantities from the plasma cells of mouse plasmacytoma MOPC 104E after lysis either in the presence or in the absence of iodoacetate. Peptide `mapping' analysis of the IgMs after partial reduction and carboxy[14C]methylation to label the interchain disulphide bridges showed that the heavy–light bridge and the interheavy bridge present in the Cμ2 region were already formed at lysis. The cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of the heavy chains, which in pentameric IgM form an intersubunit bridge, had free thiol groups at lysis that were reversibly oxidized during isolation in the absence of iodoacetate, probably forming an intrasubunit inter-heavy-chain disulphide bridge. Isoelectric-focusing studies complemented the above findings, showing that all the intracellular IgMs carried free thiol groups that could be carboxymethylated at lysis, and that in non-alkylated preparations these had reversibly oxidized. On the basis of sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis intracellular μ-chains had a consistently lower apparent molecular weight than did secreted μ-chains, and the estimated difference could be accounted for by the known difference in carbohydrate content. We present evidence that in a position homologous to that of a complex oligosaccharide in the Cμ2 region of secreted human μ-chains there is a simple oligosaccharide in intracellular mouse μ-chains that becomes complex on secretion. On the basis of the above findings, we present a model for the mouse intracellular IgM subunit and suggest a mechanism for its assembly into secreted IgM pentamers.ImagesFig. 2.PLATE 1PLATE 2Fig. 3.

1. Protein disulphide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) and glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase (EC 1.8.4.2) activities in bovine liver were studied in parallel during purification of 'thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductase' by the procedure of Carmichael, Morin & Dixon [(1977) J Biol. Chem. 252, 7163-7167]. The two activities showed no quantitative co-purification and were partially resolved by (NH4)SO4 precipitation, indicating that distinct enzymes are present. 2. Protein disulphide-isomerase was purified by a relatively rapid method involving a combination of the early stages of the Carmichael procedure and covalent chromatography, with a new stepwise elution procedure. Ion-exchange chromatography yields a homogeneous preparation of mol.wt. 57 000. 3.

Low-speed centrifugation (640 g) of rat liver homogenates, prepared with a standard ionic medium, yielded a pellet from which a rapidly sedimenting fraction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RSER) was recovered free of nuclei. This fraction contained 20-25% of cellular RNA and approximately 30% of total glucose-6-phosphatase (ER marker) activity. A major portion of total cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondrial marker) activity was also recovered in this fraction, with the remainder sedimenting between 640 and 6,000 g. Evidence is provided which indicates that RSER may be intimately associated with mitochondria. Complete dissociation of ER from mitochondria in the RSER fraction required very harsh conditions. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis revealed that 95% dissociation could be achieved when the RSER fraction was first resuspended in buffer containing 500 mM KCl and 20 mM EDTA, and subjected to shearing. Excluding KCl, EDTA, or shearing from the procedure resulted in incomplete separation. Both electron microscopy and marker enzyme analysis of mitochondria purified by this procedure indicated that some structural damage and leakage of proteins from matrix and intermembrane compartments had occurred. Nevertheless, when mitochondria from RSER and postnuclear 6,000-g pellet fractions were purified in this way fromanimals injected with [35S]methionine +/- cycloheximide, mitochondria from the postnuclear 6,000-g pellet were found to incorporate approximately two times more cytoplasmically synthesized radioactive protein per milligram mitochondrial protein (or per unit cytochrome c oxidase activity) than did mitochondria from the RSER fraction. Mitochondria-RSER associations, therefore, do not appear to facilitate enhanced incorporation of mitochondrial proteins which are newly synthesized in the cytoplasm.

Protein disulphide-isomerase activity was determined in homogenates of chick-embryo tissues. Activities were highest in tissues active in procollagen synthesis and were maximal at the developmental stage of maximal procollagen synthesis. These variations in protein disulphide-isomerase activity correlate closely with those previously observed for protocollagen hydroxylase activities.

1. The molecular weights of chick tendon and cartilage procollagens, and their constituent polypeptides, were determined by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis. The values obtained are in good agreement and indicate that the mol.wts. of the secreted procollagens (types I and II) and their individual pro-alpha-chains are of the order of 405 000-445 000 and 137 000-145 000 respectively.2. Digestion of tendon procollagen with human rheumatoid synovial collagenase gave products consistent with the presence of large non-helical peptide extensions at both N-and C-termini. Electrophoretic analysis gave apparent mol.wts. of 17 500 and 36 000 for the respective N- and C-terminal extensions of pro-alpha1(I)-and pro-alpha2-chains, and inter-chain disulphide bonds were restricted to the C-terminal location. 3. During the biosynthesis of procollagen by tendon and cartilage cells a close correlation was observed between the extent of inter-chain disulphide bonding and the proportion of procollagen polypeptides having a triple-helical conformation. These processes appeared to commence in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and be completed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the rate at which they occur in cartilage cells is markedly slower than that found in tendon cells. 4. When the intracellular [14C]procollagen polypeptides present in the rough-endoplasmic-reticulum fractions of tendon and cartilage cells were analysed under non-reducing conditions on agarose/polyacrylamide composite gels, no significant pools of dimeric intermediates were detected. 5. In both cell types, inter-chain disulphide-bond formation occurred even when hydroxylation, and hence triple-helix formation, was inhibited. The presence of pro-alpha1- and pro-alpha2-components in a ratio of 2:1 in the disulphide-linked unhydroxylated procollagen isolated from tendon cells demonstrated that correct chain association occurs in the absence of hydroxylation. This observation is consistent with a model for the assembly of pro-gamma112-chains in which the recognition and selection of pro-alpha1-and pro-alpha2-chains in a 2:1 ratio are directed by the non-helical C-terminal extension peptides of tendon procollagen.

A re-examination of the subcellular fractions obtained from matrix-free chick tendon and cartilage cells has been made since the discovery that three out of four of the micrographs of chick tendon microsomal fractions published in an earlier paper from this laboratory were not authentic. The present studies demonstrate that by using the procedures previously reported it is possible to isolate microsomal and submicrosomal fractions from tendon and cartilage cells which exhibit typical morphology when examined by electron microscopy. These observations are consistent with our original biochemical characterization of subcellular fractions, which we know to be valid. Other publications from this laboratory in which these fractionation procedures have been applied to studies of collagen biosynthesis are in no way compromised, and indeed, most of our data have been confirmed by several other laboratories.ImagesPLATE 1	The subcellular fractionation of embryonic chick tendon and cartilage cells: a re-examination.

Antibodies to pure lysyl hydroxylase from whole chick embryos were prepared in rabbits and used for immunological characterization of this enzyme of collagen biosynthesis. In double immunodiffusion a single precipitation line was seen between the antiserum and crude or pure chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylase. The antiserum effectively inhibited chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylase activity, whether measured with the biologically prepared protocollagen substrate or a synthetic peptide consisting of only 12 amino acids. This suggests that the antigenic determinant was located near the active site of the enzyme molecule. Essentially identical amounts of the antiserum were required for 40% inhibition of the same amount of lysyl hydroxylase activity units from different chick-embryo tissues synthesizing various genetically distinct collagen types. In double immunodiffusion a single precipitation line of complete identity was found between the antiserum and the purified enzyme from whole chick embryos and the crude enzymes from chick-embryo tendon, cartilage and kidneys. These results do not support the hypothesis that lysyl hydroxylase has collagen-type-specific or tissue-specific isoenzymes with markedly different specific activities or immunological properties. The antibodies to chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylase showed a considerable degree of species specificity when examined either by activity-inhibition assay or by double immuno-diffusion. Nevertheless, a distinct, although weak, cross-reactivity was found between the chick-embryo enzyme and those from all mammalian tissues tested. The antiserum showed no cross-reactivity against prolyl 3-hydroxylase, hydroxylysyl galactosyl-transferase or galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase in activity-inhibition assays, whereas a distinct cross-reactivity was found against prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Furthermore, antiserum to pure prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibited lysyl hydroxylase activity. These findings suggest that there are structural similarities between these two enzymes, possibly close to or at their active sites.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.

Suspension-cultured cells of Phaseolus vulgaris (French bean) incorporated [1-3H] arabinose in vivo into high-Mr polymers that could be separated into glycoprotein and polysaccharide. Microsomal membranes from suspension-cultured cells of beans incorporated arabinose from UDP-beta-L-arabinose in vitro into both polysaccharide and glycoprotein. The enzyme involved in arabinan synthesis, arabinan synthase, appeared to be immunologically distinct from the protein:arabinosyltransferase system. Both these activities are inducible, but behave differently with either plant-growth-regulator or fungal-elicitor treatments. After subculture of cells entering the stationary growth phase the arabinan synthase activity reaches much higher values than does that of the protein transferase system during the initial period of cell division and growth, whereas after elicitation at the same growth stage, all the increased incorporation of arabinose occurs into glycoprotein of Mr higher than 200 000 and to a greater extent into a specific glycoprotein of Mr 42 500. Preliminary characterization of these glycoproteins prepared under non-reducing conditions and after acid and alkaline hydrolysis suggests that the high-Mr glycoprotein material is similar to arabinogalactan protein, whereas the lower-Mr material may be a hydroxyproline-rich protein existing as a dimer and that specifically increases during the hypersensitive response of the cells to the fungal elicitor from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum.

Membrane fractions from bean hypocotyl or suspension cultures incorporated arabinose from UDP-beta-L-arabinose into arabinan and xylose from UDP-alpha-D-xylose in vitro; the level of each activity was dependent on the state of differentiation of the cells. These activities may be due to single transglycosylases, since no lipid or proteinaceous intermediate acceptors were found in either case. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that enzyme activity in vitro was localized in both Golgi-derived membranes and endoplasmic reticulum in similar amounts. However, incorporation into the polymers in vivo in suspension culture cells incubated with [1-3H]arabinose was considerably greater in the Golgi-derived membranes. Thus, although these enzymes may be translated and inserted at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum, their activities are under other levels of control, so that most of the activity in vivo is confined to the Golgi apparatus. Initiation of glycosylation in the endoplasmic activity may, however, occur.	Arabinan synthase and xylan synthase activities of Phaseolus vulgaris.

Membrane preparations from growing regions of 8-day old Pisum sativum epicotyls contain multiple beta-1,4-glucan (cellulose) synthetase activities (UDP- or GDP-glucose: beta-1,4-glucan-glucosyl transferase), and the levels of some of these are influenced by treatments with the growth hormone, indoleacetic acid (IAA). When membranes from control epicotyl segments (zero time) are fractionated by isopycnic sedimentation in sucrose density gradients, all of the synthetase activities are associated mainly with Golgi membrane (density 1.55 g/cm3). After decapitation and treatment of epicotyls with IAA, synthetases also appear in a smooth vesicle fraction (density 1.11 g/cm3) which is rich in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker enzyme. Major fractions of these synthetases are not recovered in association with plasma membrane or washed cell walls. When [14-C]sucrose is supplied in vivo to segments +/- IAA, radioactive cellulose is deposited only in the wall. Cellulose or cellodextrin precursors do not accumulate in those membranes in which synthetase activities are recovered in vitro. In experiments where tissue slices containing intact cells are supplied with [14C]sugar nucleotide in vitro, alkali-insoluble beta-1,4-glucan is synthesized (presumably outside the protoplast) at rates which greatly exceeded (20-30 times) those obtained using isolated membrane preparations. Progressive disruption of cell structure results in increasing losses of this high activity. These results are consistent with the interpretation that Golgi and ER-associated synthetases are not themselves loci for cellulose synthesis in vivo, but represent enzymes in transit to sites of action at the wall:protoplast omterface. There they operate only if integrity of cellular organization is maintained.	The site of cellulose synthesis.

Incubation of a particulate preparation from potato tissue culture cells with UDP-beta-L-[1-3H] arabinose yielded a glycoprotein fraction containing labelled material with the characteristics of hydroxyproline arabinosides. The sugar-protein linkage was resistant to hot alkaline hydrolysis, and the hydrolytic products showed similar electrophoretic and chromatographic behavior to authentic hydroxyproline-arabinosides prepared from potato tissue culture cell walls. Incorporation of arabinose into glycoprotein was stimulated by the addition of de-arabinosylated potato lectin. The product of the incubation co-migrated with native potato lectin on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The subcellular distribution of the arabinosyl-transferase was investigated by fractionating potato tissue culture membranes on a discontinuous sucrose gradient in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Under both fractionation conditions the highest specific activity of the enzyme was found in the Golgi-enriched fraction. The results are discussed in relation to the synthesis of the hydroxy-proline-rich glycoprotein component of plant cell walls.

Suspension cells of bean subcultured into medium that maintains the culture and stimulates cell division but not differentiation brings about an increase in arabinan synthase activity. Subculture into a medium that induces both cell division and xylogenesis brings about in addition an increase in xylan synthase. Both synthases are membrane-bound and are concerned with the formation of neutral pectin or hemicellulose of the cell wall respectively. During the rising phase of the induction of these activities in the appropriate culture medium, the increases in activities were inhibited by either actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcription) or D-2-(4-methyl-2,6-dinitroanilino)-N-methylpropionamide (an inhibitor of translation). Thus the control for the induction of the enzyme activities involves transcription and possibly translation. Subculture of the cells brought about an increase, probably non-specific, in total membrane-bound translation, as indicated by increased amounts of bound polysomes and incorporation of [35S]methionine into membrane proteins. If the control of the appearance of specific mRNA molecules is partially effected by growth factors then these are probably operative during the period of the cell cycle that is stimulated by subculture and it is probably at this time that the growth factors act to bring about the changes necessary for differentiation.

Isopenicillin N synthetase was extracted from Cephalosporium acremonium and purified about 200-fold. The product showed one major protein band, coinciding with synthetase activity, when subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. An isopenicillin N synthetase from Penicillium chrysogenum was purified about 70-fold by similar procedures. The two enzymes resemble each other closely in their Mr, in their mobility on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel and in their requirement for Fe2+ and ascorbate for maximum activity.

The tripeptide delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine, an intermediate in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway, is converted to isopenicillin N by isopenicillin N synthetase (cyclase) of Penicillium chrysogenum. The cyclization required dithiothreitol and was stimulated by ferrous ions and ascorbate. Co2+ and Mn2+ completely inhibited enzyme activity. Optimal temperature and pH were 25 degrees C and 7.8, respectively. The reaction required O2 and was stimulated by increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration of the reaction mixture. Purification of the enzyme to a single major band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was achieved by protamine sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation (50 to 80% of saturation), DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The estimated molecular weight was 39,000 +/- 1,000. The apparent Km of isopenicillin N synthetase for delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine was 0.13 mM. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by glutathione, which acts as a competitive inhibitor. A good correlation was observed between the isopenicillin N synthetase activity in extracts of four different strains of P. chrysogenum (with widely different penicillin-producing capability) and the amount of penicillin production by these strains.Images	Isopenicillin N synthetase of Penicillium chrysogenum, an enzyme that converts delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine to isopenicillin N.

A plasmid conferring resistance to the aminocyclitol antibiotic hygromycin B was isolated from Escherichia coli. The gene conferring resistance to this drug was cloned in pBR322, and the gene was localized to a fragment of ca. 1,510 base pairs. Resistance to hygromycin B is determined by an aminocyclitol phosphotransferase that modifies hygromycin B and structurally related antibiotics. The specific modification of hygromycin B is a phosphorylation of the hydroxyl on the 4 position of the cyclitol ring (hyosamine). The presence of the phosphotransferase in E. coli correlates with reduced accumulation of [14C]hygromycin B.Images	Genetic and enzymatic basis of hygromycin B resistance in Escherichia coli.

Macrocin-O-methyltransferase (MacOMeTase) catalyzes the final enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of tylosin in Streptomyces fradiae. A 44-base mixed oligonucleotide probe containing only guanosine and cytidine in the third position of degenerate codons was synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of MacOMeTase. Plaque blot hybridization to a bacteriophage lambda library and colony blot hybridization to a cosmid library of S. fradiae DNA identified recombinants that contained overlapping fragments of chromosomal DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA verified that the DNA contained the coding sequence for MacOMeTase.

beta-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins are synthesized by a wide variety of microbes, including procaryotes and eucaryotes. Isopenicillin N synthetase catalyzes a key reaction in the biosynthetic pathway of penicillins and cephalosporins. The genes encoding this protein have previously been cloned from the filamentous fungi Cephalosporium acremonium and Penicillium chrysogenum and characterized. We have extended our analysis to the isopenicillin N synthetase genes from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and the gram-positive procaryote Streptomyces lipmanii. The isopenicillin N synthetase genes from these organisms have been cloned and sequenced, and the proteins encoded by the open reading frames were expressed in Escherichia coli. Active isopenicillin N synthetase enzyme was recovered from extracts of E. coli cells prepared from cells containing each of the genes in expression vectors. The four isopenicillin N synthetase genes studied are closely related. Pairwise comparison of the DNA sequences showed between 62.5 and 75.7% identity; comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences showed between 53.9 and 80.6% identity. The close homology of the procaryotic and eucaryotic isopenicillin N synthetase genes suggests horizontal transfer of the genes during evolution.Images	Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of isopenicillin N synthetase genes from Streptomyces lipmanii and Aspergillus nidulans.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H) catalyses a vital post-translational modification in the biosynthesis of collagen. The enzyme consists of two distinct polypeptides forming an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer (alpha = 64 kDa, beta = 60 kDa), the beta-subunit being identical to the multifunctional enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). By studying the cell-free synthesis of the rat alpha-subunit of P4-H we have shown that the alpha-subunit can be translocated, glycosylated and the signal peptide cleaved by dog pancreatic microsomal membranes to yield both singly and doubly glycosylated forms. When translations were carried out under conditions which prevent disulfide bond formation, the product synthesized formed aggregates which were associated with the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). Translations carried out under conditions that promote disulfide bond formation yielded a product that was not associated with BiP but formed a complex with the endogenous beta-subunit (PDI). Complex formation was detected by co-precipitation of the newly synthesized alpha-subunit with antibodies raised against PDI, by sucrose gradient centrifugation and by chemical cross-linking. When microsomal vesicles were depleted of PDI, BiP and other soluble endoplasmic reticulum proteins, no complex formation was observed and the alpha-subunit aggregated even under conditions that promote disulfide bond formation. We have therefore demonstrated that the enzyme P4-H can be assembled at synthesis in a cell-free system and that the solubility of the alpha-subunit is dependent upon its association with PDI.Images	Cell-free synthesis and assembly of prolyl 4-hydroxylase: the role of the beta-subunit (PDI) in preventing misfolding and aggregation of the alpha-subunit.

The binding of C1q to the human macrophage cell line U937 has been studied. Fluorescence microscopy with fluorescein-conjugated F(ab')2 anti-C1q antibody showed that 100% of the cell population is able to bind exogenous C1q. Monomeric C1q binding to U937 cells is very weak at normal ionic strength (I0.15) and was therefore investigated at I0.07, conditions which stabilize the binding. However, aggregation of C1q on dextran sulphate or a lipid A-rich lipopolysaccharide allowed a firm, binding at I0.15. Quantitative binding studies with monomeric 125I-C1q showed a concentration-dependent, saturable, specific and reversible binding involving specific membrane receptors. Scatchard plots of C1q binding indicated [1.6 +/- 0.7 (1 S.D.)] X 10(6) sites per cell with an equilibrium constant of (2.9 +/- 1.8) X 10(7) M-1 at I0.07. The location of the molecule region mediating C1q binding was established with collagen-like fragments prepared by partial pepsin digestion, confirming earlier results obtained by inhibition studies.

Conglutinin binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner to the carbohydrate portion of zymosan and cell-bound iC3b (complement subcomponent C3b cleaved by Factor I in the presence of factor H) similarly to lectin-like proteins that participate in the clearance of plasma glycoproteins. This carbohydrate-binding protein has been found to include both collagenous and non-collagenous domains. Electron micrographs of bovine conglutinin are presented in which conglutinin appears as a tetramer of four 'lollipop' structures emanating from a central hub. The stem region, linking each head to the central hub, is quite stiff, whereas the hub-stem junction is a flexible hinge. From electron micrographs of a pepsin digest of conglutinin, the linkage region is identified as the collagenous portion of the macromolecule. Conglutinin is a multimer of a single polypeptide chain. From sedimentation equilibria of unreduced as compared with reduced and alkylated conglutinin, there are determined to be three disulphide-linked chains. These data, combined with information on the subunit polypeptide of conglutinin, suggest a model for conglutinin in which four disulphide-linked trimers are associated via the N-termini to form the intact macromolecule as viewed in the electron microscope. The ultrastructure of conglutinin appears ideally suited to its lectin-like function.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 5.	Ultrastructure and composition of bovine conglutinin.

The apoproteins of pulmonary surfactant (PSAP) are thought to be critical for normal surfactant function. They bind to surfactant phospholipids and enhance their ability to form surface films in vitro. These acidic glycoproteins have monomeric molecular weights of 36,000, 32,000, and 28,000 (PSAP-36, -32, and -28). Each member of this family of proteins has a similar amino acid composition and their differences in electrophoretic mobility are due in part to glycosylation. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of PSAP-32 from the nucleotide sequence of PSAP cDNA. A cDNA library was prepared from canine lung poly(A)+ RNA and screened with oligonucleotide probes that were based on the NH2-terminal amino acids of PSAP-32 determined by Edman degradation. This protein has the striking feature of collagen-like and non-collagen-like sequences in the same polypeptide chain. There are 24 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets, where Yaa is often hydroxyproline. These repeats comprise one-third of PSAP near the NH2 terminus. The remaining two-thirds of PSAP is resistant to bacterial collagenase digestion and contains a possible N-glycosylation site near the carboxyl terminus.

When chicken calpain II autolysed in the presence of Ca2+, it underwent limited proteolysis to give peptides of Mr 54,000 and 37,000, and several of Mr approx. 30,000 and 18,000. The autolytic peptides were purified and their N-terminal amino acid sequences determined. By comparison of these sequences with the known sequence of the complete calpain molecule, the autolytic cleavage sites were identified. The structural integrity of the molecule during autolysis was investigated by gel-permeation chromatography. Experiments were also done to test the reversibility of adding EDTA to calpain during autolysis, measured as recoverable enzyme activity assayed in the presence of Ca2+. The results are presented in terms of a model for the structural changes occurring in calpain during autolysis. It was concluded that the loss of enzymic activity, which is a consequence of autolysis, was due to dissociation of the autolytic peptides after cleavage of the calpain large subunit within the third domain.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 4.

"cDNA clones specific for the light subunit of porcine calpain I have been isolated from a porcine kidney cDNA library. The complete primary structure of the light subunit has been revealed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA clones isolated and amino acid sequence analysis of peptides isolated from the purified mature protein. We found that the light subunit contains two distinct domains. Domain I, the amino-terminal half, has two unusually long, paired polyglycyl sequences and may serve as a binding site to the heavy subunit. Domain II, the carboxyl-terminal half, is a region highly homologous to the putative Ca2+-binding domain of the heavy subunit of chicken calpain elucidated recently. This region has four potential Ca2+-binding sites, each having the ""E-F hand"" structure. Our results suggest that the Ca2+-mediated proteolytic activity of calpain is controlled through the cooperative and/or sequential actions of multiple Ca2+-binding sites present in both two-subunit molecules, heavy and light subunits of calpain.Images"	A putative Ca2+-binding protein: structure of the light subunit of porcine calpain elucidated by molecular cloning and protein sequence analysis.

Extensins are hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins found in many plant cell walls as a major protein component. The peptide Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp is abundant in the extensins. Using extensin cDNA clones as probes, we isolated six different clones from carrot genomic libraries. One of the genomic clones, pDC5A1, was characterized and found to contain an open reading frame encoding extensin and a single intron in the 3'-non-coding region. The derived amino acid sequence contains a signal peptide sequence and 25 Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro repetitive sequences. Two extensin transcripts were found corresponding to pDC5A1 with different 5' start sites. These transcripts increase in abundance after wounding. This is consistent with the reported extensin accumulation in the cell wall upon wounding.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.Fig. 8.

Splice junction and possible branch point sequences have been collected from 177 plant introns. Consensus sequences for the 5' and 3' splice junctions and for possible branch points have been derived. The splice junction consensus sequences were virtually identical to those of animal introns except that the polypyrimidine stretch at the 3' splice junction was less pronounced in the plant introns. A search for possible branch points with sequences related to the yeast, vertebrate and fungal consensus sequences revealed a similar sequence in plant introns.

We have investigated the regulation of gene expression by the plant hormone ethylene by cloning mRNAs that accumulate in unripe tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum) exposed to exogenous ethylene. The response to exogenous ethylene is rapid; within 30-120 min we detect an increase in the cloned mRNA concentrations. DNA sequence analysis indicates that one of the ethylene-inducible genes is related to a gene encoding wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor I. We have measured ethylene production during fruit development and detect low basal levels in unripe fruit and much higher levels in ripening fruit. Blot hybridization experiments show that expression of the cloned genes is developmentally regulated by ethylene during fruit ripening: the mRNAs produced by these genes are more abundant in ripe fruit than in unripe fruit, and this mRNA accumulation is repressed by a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action, norbornadiene. However, during fruit development some of the cloned mRNAs begin to accumulate when ethylene production is at a basal level, whereas other mRNAs begin to accumulate later when the endogenous ethylene concentration increases, suggesting that gene expression during fruit development can be activated by ethylene in two ways. In some cases gene expression is primarily activated by an increase in sensitivity to basal ethylene levels, whereas in other cases it may be regulated by an increase in ethylene concentration.Images	Regulation of gene expression by ethylene during Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit development.

The transcriptional enhancer of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) is organized as a 75-base-pair repeat, and in each copy of the repeat there are multiple binding sites for nuclear factors. We have introduced point mutations into each of the known nuclear factor-binding sites in the MoMLV enhancer, in both copies of the direct repeat, and have analyzed the transcriptional activity conferred by the mutated enhancers by transient-expression assays in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines. Mutation of individual binding sites in the MoMLV enhancer has moderate effects (less than 2-fold to 20-fold) on transcription in six independent cell lines. Several mutations decreased transcription from the MoMLV enhancer ubiquitously (the leukemia virus factor b site and the glucocorticoid response element), whereas others affected transcription specifically in lymphoid cell lines (core motif) or, more significantly, in fibroblasts (nuclear factor 1 site). The transcriptional activity of the MoMLV enhancer can be induced 8- to 10-fold by 1,3-phorbol myristate acetate in Jurkat T cells. Mutations in any of three adjacent binding sites (leukemia virus factor b and c sites and the core motif) within a 28-base-pair region in the center of the direct repeat sequence of the MoMLV enhancer completely attenuate the response to 1,3-phorbol myristate acetate.Images	Point mutations in the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer identify a lymphoid-specific viral core motif and 1,3-phorbol myristate acetate-inducible element.

We have analyzed t(1;14)(p32;q11) chromosome translocations from two patients with T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The chromosome 1 breakpoints of these patients lie within a kilobasepair of each other, and thus define a genetic locus (designated tal) involved in T cell oncogenesis. Moreover, we have identified sequences within tal that potentially encode an amphipathic helix-loop-helix motif, a DNA-binding domain found in a variety of proteins that control cell growth and differentiation. The homology domain of tal is especially related to that of lyl-1, a gene on chromosome 19 that has also been implicated in T cell oncogenesis. Hence, tal and lyl-1 encode a distinct family of helix-loop-helix proteins involved in the malignant development of lymphocytes.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 3.Fig. 6.

We aligned published sequences for the U3 region of 35 type C mammalian retroviruses. The alignment reveals that certain sequence motifs within the U3 region are strikingly conserved. A number of these motifs correspond to previously identified sites. In particular, we found that the enhancer region of most of the viruses examined contains a binding site for leukemia virus factor b, a viral corelike element, the consensus motif for nuclear factor 1, and the glucocorticoid response element. Most viruses containing more than one copy of enhancer sequences include these binding sites in both copies of the repeat. We consider this set of binding sites to constitute a framework for the enhancers of this set of viruses. Other highly conserved motifs in the U3 region include the retrovirus inverted repeat sequence, a negative regulatory element, and the CCAAT and TATA boxes. In addition, we identified two novel motifs in the promoter region that were exceptionally highly conserved but have not been previously described.

The role of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and other resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen in co- and post-translational modification of secretory proteins has been studied in experiments on translation in vitro. We have devised procedures for extracting the lumenal content proteins of dog pancreas microsomal vesicles by alkaline buffer, or detergent washing, and for reconstitution of the depleted membrane fraction. When microsomal membranes are depleted of content by washing at pH 9.1, they are able to co-translationally glycosylate human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and yeast pro-alpha-factor and the products appear to be identical to those produced by control microsomes. However, when microsomal membranes are depleted of content by washing with saponin they are still able to co-translationally translocate and glycosylate human IFN-gamma, but the products were of higher apparent Mr than those generated by control microsomes. When saponin-washed microsomal membranes were reconstituted with homogeneous protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), the generated vesicles gave the same pattern of co-translationally glycosylated IFN-gamma as saponin-washed microsomal membranes lacking PDI. These results are discussed in relation to the roles of resident ER proteins in co-translational modification; they suggest that PDI is not an essential component of the machinery of co-translational N-glycosylation, but that detergent washing may inactivate or remove some ER glycosidases.ImagesFig.1Fig.2Fig.3Fig.4Fig.5Fig.6Fig.7	Cotranslational glycosylation of proteins in systems depleted of protein disulphide isomerase.

1. The glycosylation of hydroxylysine during the biosynthesis of procollagen by embryonic chick tendon and cartilage cells was examined. When free and membrane-bound ribosomes isolated from cells labelled for 4min with [14C]lysine were assayed for hydroxy[14C]lysine and hydroxy[14C]lysine glycosides, it was found that hydroxylation took place only on membrane-bound ribosomes and that some synthesis of galactosylhydroxy[14C]lysine and glucosylgalactosylhydroxy[14C]lysine had occurred on the nascent peptides. 2. Assays of subcellular fractions isolated from tendon and cartilage cells labelled for 2h with [14C]lysine demonstrated that the glycosylation of procollagen polypeptides began in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 14C-labelled polypeptides present in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi fractions were glycosylated to extents almost identical with the respective secreted procollagens. 3. Assays specific for collagen galactosyltransferase and collagen glucosyltransferase are described, using as substrate chemically treated bovine anterior-lens-capsule collagen. 4. When homogenates were assayed for the collagen glycosyltransferase activities, addition of Triton X-100 (0.01%, w/v) was found to stimulate enzyme activities by up to 45%, suggesting that the enzymes were probably membrane-bound. 5. Assays of subcellular fractions obtained by differential centrifugation for collagen galactosyltransferase activity indicated the specific activity to be highest in the microsomal fractions. Similar results were obtained for collagen glucosyltransferase activity. 6. When submicrosomal fractions obtained by discontinuous-sucrose-density-gradient-centrifugation procedures were assayed for these enzymic activities, the collagen galactosyltransferase was found to be distributed in the approximate ratio 7:3 between rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum of both cell types. Similar determinations of collagen glucosyltransferase indicated a distribution in the approximate ratio 3:2 between rough and smooth microsomal fractions. 7. Assays of subcellular fractions for the plasma-membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase revealed a distribution markedly different from the distributions obtained for the collagen glycosyltransferase. 8. The studies described here demonstrate that glycosylation occurs early in the intracellular processing of procollagen polypeptides rather than at the plasma membrane, as was previously suggested.

Hydroxylation of lysine and glycosylation of hydroxylysine during collagen biosynthesis in isolated chick-embryo cartilage cells were studied by using continuous labelling and pulse-chase labelling experiments with [14C]lysine. Control experiments with [14C]proline indicated that in continuous labelling the hydroxylation of [14C]proline became linear with time after about 4 min and the secretion of collagen after about 35 min, as reported previously. In similar experiments with [14C]lysine the hydroxylation of [14C]lysine and the glycosylations of hydroxy[14C]lysine became linear at about 4 min, suggesting that these reactions were initiated while the polypeptide chains were growing on the ribosomes. Pulse-chase labelling experiments with [14C]lysine indicated that after a 5 min pulse-label the hydroxylation of [14C]lysine and the glycosylations of hydroxyl[14C]lysine continued during the chase period for about 20 min. The data suggest that these reactions are continued after the release of complete polypeptide chains into the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the reactions are probably not continued after the formation of the triple helix and the movement of the molecules into the Golgi vacuoles.

The glycosylations of hydroxylysine during collagen biosynthesis in isolated chick-embryo tendon cells were studied by using pulse-chase labelling experiments with [14C]-lysine. The hydroxylation of lysine and the glycosylations of hydroxylysine continued after a 5 min pulse label for up to about 10 min during the chase period. These data differ from those obtained previously in isolated chick-embryo cartilage cells, in which, after a similar 5 min pulse label, these reactions continued during the chase period for up to about 20 min. The collagen synthesized by the isolated chick-embryo tendon cells differed markedly from the type I collagen of adult tissues in its degree of hydroxylation of lysine residues and glycosylations of hydroxylysine residues. When the isolated tendon cells were incubated in the presence of L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, the degree of glycosylations of hydroxylysine during the first 10 min of the chase period was identical with that in cells incubated without thcarboxylic acid for at least 60 min, whereas no additional glycosylations took place in the control cells after the 10 min time-point. As a consequence, the collagen synthesized in the presence of this compound contained more carbohydrate than did the collagen synthesized by the control cells. Additional experiments indicated that azetidine-2-carboxylic acid did not increase the collagen glycosyltransferase activities in the tendon cells or the rate of glycosylation reactions when added directly to the enzyme incubation mixture. Control experiments with colchicine indicated that the delay in the rate of collagen secretion, which was observed in the presence of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, did not in itself affect the degree of glycosylations of collagen. The results thus suggest that the increased glycosylations were due to inhibition of the collagen triple-helix formation, which is known to occur in the presence of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.

Lysophosphatidylcholine stimulated the activities of collagen galactosyl- and glucosyl-transferases in chick-embryo extract and its particulate fractions in vitro, whereas essentially no stimulation was noted in the high-speed supernatant, where the enzymes are soluble and membrane-free. The stimulatory effect of lysophosphatidylcholine was masked by 0.1% Triton X-100. In kinetic experiments lysophosphatidylcholine raised the maximum velocities with respect to the substrates and co-substrates, whereas no changes were observed in the apparant Km values. Phospholipase A preincubation of the chick-embryo extract resulted in stimulation of both transferase activities, probably gy generating lysophosphatides from endogenous phospholipids. No stimulation by lysophosphatidylcholine was found when tested with 500-fold-purified glycosyltransferase. The results suggest that collagen glycosyltransferases must be associated with the membrane structures of the cell in order to be stimulated by lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophosphatidylcholine could have some regulatory significance in vivo, since its concentration in the cell is comparable with that which produced marked stimulation in vitro.

The activities of four intracellular enzymes of collagen biosynthesis were assayed in freshly isolated rat peritoneal macrophages and mast cells and compared with the same enzymes in freshly isolated chick-embryo tendon cells. The macrophages were found to contain activities of all four enzymes, those of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase being 7 and 12% respectively of those in the tendon cells when expressed per cell or 3 and 4% when expressed per unit of soluble cell protein. The corresponding values for hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase activities were about 82 and 68% or 32 and 24% respectively. When the macrophages were incubated in suspension with [14C]proline, they synthesized a small but significant amount of non-diffusible hydroxy[14C]proline. The synthesis per cell was only about 0.1% of that formed by the tendon cells, and its distribution between the cells and the medium also differed from that in the tendon cells. The hydroxy[14C]proline synthesized by the macrophages may be present in the Clq subcomponent of the complement, but its amount was too small to allow any characterization of the protein. All four enzyme activities, and in particular the two hydroxylysyl glycosyltransferase activities, seem to be present in macrophages in a large excess compared with the very low rate of synthesis of hydroxy-proline-containing polypeptide chains. The mast cell extract was found to inhibit all four enzyme activities, but even when corrected for this inhibition, prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase activities in the mast cells were less than 0.08% and the two hydroxylysyl glycosyltransferase activities less than 1% of those in the tendon cells. The intracellular enzyme pattern of collagen biosynthesis in the mast cells is thus completely or virtually completely repressed.

The major excreted protein (MEP) purified from Kirsten-virus-transformed 3T3 fibroblasts and mature human cathepsin L were compared in respect to a number of catalytic criteria and found to be similar. The Mr of MEP is 39,000, whereas that of mature human cathepsin L is 30,000. Sequence data suggested that MEP could be a pro-form of mouse cathepsin L. Both enzymes acted on the synthetic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide with similar catalytic constants and acted optimally at pH 5.5. Both were rapidly inactivated by the active-site-directed inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Phe-diazomethane and L-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidin o)butane, and furthermore, 3H-labelled L-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leucylamido-(4-acetamid o)butane, which binds covalently to the heavy chain of mature cathepsin L, also bound to MEP. MEP autolyses rapidly at pH 3.0 to give lower-Mr (35,000 and 30,000) forms, but all forms react with the radiolabelled inhibitor. No autolysis occurred above pH 5.0. MEP hydrolysed azocasein at pH 5.0, demonstrating that it is capable of hydrolysing protein substrates without autolytic activation. Unlike mature forms of cathepsin L, MEP is stable, but not active, at neutral pH. The present work shows that cathepsin L can be secreted as a higher-Mr precursor that is stable in extracellular fluids but only active where local pH values fall below 6.0. These results suggest that the extra N-terminal peptide on MEP is not an activation peptide, but is a regulatory peptide affecting the pH-stability and activity of mouse cathepsin L.ImagesFig. 4.Fig. 5.

Transfection of an activated rat oncogene into NIH3T3 fibroblasts leads to transformation and induction of a metastatic phenotype. To identify genes whose activation might mediate these processes, we used a differential screening strategy. A 1.5-kb transcript is induced fiftyfold, constitutes 1% of ras transformed cell messenger RNA (mRNA) and is the most abundantly induced message in these cells. Our sequence data shows that it encodes murine cathepsin L, a potent collagenolytic and elastinolytic lysosomal enzyme. The murine clone was used to isolate human cathepsin L complementary DNA (cDNA) clones. The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human and murine preprocathepsin L are presented and compared to other papain family cysteine proteinases. Northern analysis shows that both human and murine cathepsin L probes hybridize to a 1.5-kb transcript in several tissues, but also to a 4-kb transcript in human kidney. These clones will facilitate studies of the structure, expression, and function of cathepsin L, including its unexpected upregulation in transformation.Images	Complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human and murine preprocathepsin L.

The major active forms of cathepsins B and L were identified in Kirsten-virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts by the use of a specific radiolabelled inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Tyr(-125I)-Ala-CHN2. No other proteins were labelled, demonstrating the specificity of this inhibitor for cysteine proteinases. Cathepsins B and L were distinguished by the use of specific antibodies. One active form of cathepsin B, Mr 33,000-35,000, and two active forms of cathepsin L, Mr 30,000 and 23,000, were identified. The intracellular precursors of these proteins had higher Mr values of 39,000 and 36,000 for cathepsins B and L respectively, as shown by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine-labelled proteins. These did not react with the inhibitor under our culture conditions. The precursor of cathepsin L was secreted whereas the precursor of cathepsin B was not, demonstrating that secretions of the two enzymes are regulated differently. In contrast with results found previously for the purified protein [Mason, Gal & Gottesman (1987) Biochem. J. 248, 449-454], the secreted precursor form of cathepsin L did not react with the inhibitor either, indicating that it is not active and therefore, as such, cannot be directly involved in tumour invasion. The secreted protein did react with the inhibitor when incubated at pH 3.0, showing that the protein can be activated, although this did not occur under our culture conditions.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.

Cathepsin L was partially purified from lysates of freshly isolated macrophages lavaged from lungs of apparently healthy adults and found to be chromatographically and catalytically identical with liver cathepsin L. Western-blotting analysis showed that lung macrophages contain significant levels of a precursor of cathepsin L (43 kDa) in addition to mature enzyme (25 kDa). After culturing for a further 24 h, the precursor disappeared and a new band, corresponding to 34 kDa, appeared, suggesting that the precursor had been processed to an intermediate form of cathepsin L. Biosynthetic labelling of macrophages in vitro with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation with the cathepsin L antibody confirmed that the cells synthesize cathepsin L as a 43 kDa precursor that is then processed to the mature form (25 kDa) via a 34 kDa intermediate. The precursor, but not the processed forms, was released into the culture medium. During culture in vitro the 34 kDa intermediate accumulated, and little enzyme was processed to the 24 kDa form, consistent with the immunoblot data. Human lung macrophages contain a 1.5 kb transcript of cathepsin L mRNA, whereas none is detectable in human monocytes. These results establish that differentiation of human macrophages within the lung is accompanied by synthesis and expression of an elastinolytic enzyme, cathepsin L. The altered processing of cathepsin L observed during cultivation in vitro suggests caution in the assessment of the elastinolytic potential of human macrophages based on assay in vitro.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

Cathepsin S was detected in bovine kidney, spleen, lymph nodes and lung by immunochemical methods. The immunostaining of cathepsin S in kidney was concentrated to the cells of the proximal tubule, where the enzyme was present in cytoplasmic granules. The purification method for cathepsin S from bovine spleen involved (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and chromatofocusing (pH 8.0-6.0). The enzyme was partially destroyed by autolysis of the homogenate at pH 4.2. The isoelectric point of cathepsin S was 7.0. Cathepsin S was found to hydrolyse proteins at a similar rate to cathepsin L below pH 7.0. At pH values of 7.0-7.5 cathepsin S retained most of its activity, whereas cathepsin L was completely inactive.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 6.	Cathepsin S from bovine spleen.

The peptide-bond-specificity of bovine spleen cathepsin S in the cleavage of the oxidized insulin B-chain and peptide methylcoumarylamide substrates was investigated and the results are compared with those obtained with rat liver cathepsins L and B. Major cleavage sites in the oxidized insulin B-chain generated by cathepsin S are the bonds Glu13-Ala14, Leu17-Val18 and Phe23-Tyr26; minor cleavage sites are the bonds Asn3-Gln4, Ser9-His10 and Leu15-Tyr16. The bond-specificity of this proteinase is in part similar to the specificities of cathepsin L and cathepsin N. Larger differences are discernible in the reaction with synthetic peptide substrates. Cathepsin S prefers smaller neutral amino acid residues in the subsites S2 and S3, whereas cathepsin L efficiently hydrolyses substrates with bulky hydrophobic residues in the P2 and P3 positions. The results obtained from inhibitor studies differ somewhat from those based on substrates. Z-Phe-Ala-CH2F (where Z- represents benzyloxycarbonyl-) is a very potent time-dependent inhibitor for cathepsin S, and inhibits this proteinase 30 times more efficiently than it does cathepsin L and about 300 times better than it does cathepsin B. By contrast, the peptidylmethanes Z-Val-Phe-CH3 and Z-Phe-Lys(Z)-CH3 inhibit competitively both cathepsin S and cathepsin L in the micromolar range.	The specificity of bovine spleen cathepsin S.

The degradative actions of cathepsins L and B on human articular-cartilage proteoglycan aggregates were examined. Cathepsin L was found to be much more extensive than cathepsin B in degrading proteoglycan aggregates. It released products with size similar to that of single chondroitin sulphate chains, and a series of degraded link-protein fragments in the digestion mixtures. These proteolytically modified link-protein components (Mr 25,000 and 33,000) have similar Mr values to those of fragments observed in adult human cartilage. In contrast, cathepsin B exhibited a much more limited degradation on both proteoglycan subunits and link-protein components. Both cathepsins L and B generate multiple but distinct cleavage sites on human link proteins, and the hydrolysed bonds have been identified in the region between residues 18 and 29. Protein sequencing analysis of these modified link-protein components also provided evidence for the location of a second N-linked glycosylation site at residue 41 in human link proteins, in addition to that previously described at residue 6 on a proportion of the link proteins. Furthermore, it allows us to report the sequence of human link protein up to residue 65.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.

We characterized a clone carrying the guinea pig preproinsulin gene, which, in contrast to other mammalian preproinsulin genes, is highly divergent in its regions encoding the B and A chains of mature insulin. Blot hybridization analysis indicates that this gene is present in only one copy in the guinea pig genome and that other normal or mutated preproinsulin genes do not exist in this animal. Moreover, the position of introns in this gene and the homology of its 3' flanking region to the corresponding regions of other sequenced mammalian genes show that it has been derived from the common mammalian stock. The rapid evolution of the region encoding the B and A chains can be interpreted, according to our sequence-divergence analysis, as due to the fixation of both neutral and adaptive mutations.Images	Guinea pig preproinsulin gene: an evolutionary compromise?

The cysteine proteinase cathepsin B is one member of the lysosomal acid hydrolases. Based on the peptide sequence of rat liver cathepsin B, an oligonucleotide mixture containing 128 different 17-mers was synthesized and used as a probe to screen adult and fetal human liver cDNA libraries. A recombinant clone with a 1540-nucleotide insert was identified from the fetal library, and DNA sequence analysis confirmed that this clone encodes human cathepsin B. The clone, designated pCB-1, has sequences for 81% of the coding region (for amino acid residues 50-252) together with approximately equal to 880 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA. The DNA sequence also shows that the predicted carboxyl terminus of the coding sequence is longer than the mature protein by 6 amino acid residues. Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme digests of human placental DNA revealed a simple pattern of hybridizing fragments using the cathepsin B coding sequence as probe. The result suggests that there is a single copy of cathepsin B gene per haploid genome.Images	Isolation of a cDNA clone for the human lysosomal proteinase cathepsin B.

A cDNA clone for a thiol endoproteinase has been isolated from a bovine heart cDNA library by using a mixture of 32 synthetic oligonucleotides as a hybridization probe. The inserted region is 672 base pairs in length. It contains a sequence encoding the C-terminal region of a protein that is homologous to rat liver cathepsins B and H and to plant thiol proteinases. In addition, it contains the sequence of 442 bases corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA. The inserted region was used as a specific probe in RNA transfer analysis; the size of the mRNA encoding the thiol endoproteinase is estimated to be approx. 1.7 kilobases. Thus, the maximum size of the encoded protein is about 350-400 amino acids.ImagesFig. 4.	Molecular cloning of a bovine cathepsin.	N J Gay, J E Walker	3838468	1985-02-01	17	
An 1110-base-pair cDNA clone for human cathepsin D was obtained by screening a lambda gt10 human hepatoma G2 cDNA library with a human renin exon 3 genomic fragment. Poly(A)+ RNA blot analysis with this cathepsin D clone demonstrated a message length of about 2.2 kilobases. The partial clone was used to screen a size-selected human kidney cDNA library, from which two cathepsin D recombinant plasmids with inserts of about 2200 and 2150 base pairs were obtained. The nucleotide sequences of these clones and of the lambda gt10 clone were determined. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence shows that human cathepsin D consists of 412 amino acids with 20 and 44 amino acids in a pre- and a prosegment, respectively. The mature protein region shows 87% amino acid identity with porcine cathepsin D but differs in having nine additional amino acids. Two of these are at the COOH terminus; the other seven are positioned between the previously determined junction for the light and heavy chains of porcine cathepsin D. A high degree of sequence homology was observed between human cathepsin D and other aspartyl proteases, suggesting a conservation of three-dimensional structure in this family of proteins.Images	Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA for human cathepsin D.

Human cathepsin B was purified by affinity chromatography on the semicarbazone of Gly-Phe-glycinal linked to Sepharose 4B, with elution by 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide at pH 4.0. The product obtained in high yield by the single step from crude starting material was 80-100% active cathepsin B. The possibility that this new form of affinity chromatography may be of general usefulness in the purification of cysteine proteinases is discussed.ImagesFig. 1.

Cathepsin S was purified from bovine spleen by acid autolysis, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50, CM-cellulose and activated-thiol-Sepharose. Cathepsin L was isolated from lysosomal fractions of rat liver, rat kidney and bovine liver. Generally, cathepsin L was bound tightly to CM-Sephadex C-50. Preparations of cathepsin L from rat liver, rat kidney and bovine liver were shown to have kinetic constants for the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide in the same range (Km 2-3 microM). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Phe-diazomethane proved to be a sensitive irreversible inhibitor of cathepsin L from different species. Cathepsin S differed in all these characteristics from cathepsin L. A polyclonal antibody to cathepsin L from rat reacted with bovine cathepsin L but not with bovine cathepsin S.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.	Cathepsin S.

The major excreted protein (MEP) of malignantly transformed mouse fibroblasts is a secreted thiol proteinase. Sequencing of the MEP cDNA shows the coding region for the protein to be identical with the sequence for a mouse cysteine proteinase isolated from macrophages, but the MEP cDNA is polyadenylated at a different site in the 3' non-coding region. Strong homology of MEP with human cathepsin L suggests that MEP is the mouse analogue of cathepsin L. Amino acid sequencing of the N-terminus of the secreted form of MEP indicates that, during secretion, the polypeptide is cleaved between amino acids 17 and 18. We have placed the MEP cDNA in a eukaryotic expression vector and demonstrated the production of the 39 kDa polypeptide form of mouse MEP in monkey CV-1 cells.ImagesFig. 3.

The major excreted protein (MEP) of malignantly transformed mouse fibroblasts is the precursor to an acid proteinase with enzymic specificity similar to that of human cathepsin L. By cross-hybridization with a mouse MEP sequence, cDNA clones of the human form of MEP in an SV40 expression vector were isolated. A 1.6 kb cDNA showed 70% deduced amino acid sequence identity with mouse MEP. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned human MEP was the same, except for two amino acids, as the N-terminal sequence of mature human cathepsin L, thereby establishing that human MEP is human pro-(cathepsin L). Use of this human pro-(cathepsin L) cDNA clone allowed the detection of a 1.6-1.8 kb pro-(cathepsin L) mRNA in human cells which was not detected with a mouse pro-(cathepsin L) probe.ImagesFig. 3.

The pH-dependences of kcat, Km and kcat./Km for the hydrolysis at 25 degrees C at I 0.1 of L-arginine 2-naphthylamide catalysed by cathepsin H from bovine spleen were determined in the pH range approx. 4-8. The pH-dependences of these kinetic parameters were determined also for the hydrolysis at 25 degrees C at I 0.1 of N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-arginyl-L-arginine 2-naphthylamide catalysed by cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) from bovine spleen in the pH range 7-8, which extends the studies in acidic media reported by Willenbrock & Brocklehurst [(1984) Biochem. J. 222, 805-814]. These results are discussed and related to those from the reactivity-probe kinetics reported in the preceding paper [Willenbrock & Brocklehurst (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 511-519] and to known structural features present in rat liver cathepsins B and H and in papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and actinidin (EC 3.4.22.14). Consideration of the kinetic data leads to the suggestion that in the cysteine proteinases rearrangement of intimate S-/ImH+ ion-pairs in catalytic sites is brought about by a combination of field effects in the immediate vicinity of the ion-pair and consequences of protonic dissociation of a group with pKa 5-6 remote from the catalytic site. The contributions of the two types of effect seem to differ from enzyme to enzyme. Of the four cysteine proteinases considered, only cathepsin B exerts an absolute requirement for the proton-deficient form of a group with pKa 5-6 for catalytic activity. Protonic dissociation with pKa 5-6 enhances catalytic activity in cathepsin H and in actinidin and appears to have little or no effect in papain. Only cathepsin B lacks a polar or negatively charged side chain in the residue analogous to Asp-158 in papain, and this is suggested to account for its total dependence on a protonic dissociation remote from the catalytic site.	A general framework of cysteine-proteinase mechanism deduced from studies on enzymes with structurally different analogous catalytic-site residues Asp-158 and -161 (papain and actinidin), Gly-196 (cathepsin B) and Asn-165 (cathepsin H).

A procedure for the isolation of cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) and of cathepsin H from bovine spleen involving covalent chromatography by thiol-disulphide interchange and ion-exchange chromatography was devised. The stabilities of both cathepsins in alkaline media are markedly temperature-dependent, and reliable kinetic data can be obtained at pH values up to 8 by working at 25 degrees C with a continuous spectrophotometric assay. Both enzyme preparations contain only one type of thiol group as judged by reactivity characteristics towards 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide at pH values up to 8; in each case this thiol group is essential for catalytic activity. Cathepsin H was characterized by kinetic analysis of the reactions of its thiol group with 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide in the pH range approx. 2-8 and the analogous study on cathepsin B [Willenbrock & Brocklehurst (1984) Biochem. J. 222, 805-814] was extended to include reaction at pH values up to approx. 8. Cathepsin H, like the other cysteine proteinases, was shown to contain an interactive catalytic-site system in which the nucleophilic character of the sulphur atom is maintained in acidic media. The considerable differences in catalytic site characteristics detected by this two-protonic-state reactivity probe between cathepsin B, cathepsin H, papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and actinidin (EC 3.4.22.14) are discussed. Reaction with 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide in acidic media, which is known to provide a rapid spectrophotometric active centre titration for many cysteine proteinases, is applicable to cathepsin H. This is useful because other active-centre titrations have proved unsuitable in view of the relatively low reactivity of the thiol group in cathepsin H.

Double stranded DNA has been synthesized in vitro from rabbit globin messenger RNA and elongated with homopolymeric dG tails. An E. coli plasmid was cleaved by EcoRI. The cohesive ends were repaired and dC tails added, to permit reconstitution of the EcoRI sites upon annealing with the dG elongated globin DNA. Transformation of E. coli with the globin-plasmid DNA hybrid has yielded a clone which harbours a recombinant plasmid (pCR1-betaG1), as demonstrated by hybridization experiments with radioactive globin cDNA. The sequence carried by the recombinant plasmid corresponds to part of the gene sequence coding for the beta chain of rabbit globin. Circular DNA of the purified recombinant plasmid exhibits sensitivity to EcoRI.Images	Insertion of a rabbit beta-globin gene sequence into an E. coli plasmid.

We have isolated a cDNA clone for one of the HLA-B locus alloantigens by hybridization with a 30-nucleotide-long DNA probe. The probe was isolated from a reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA nucleotidyltransferase)-catalyzed cDNA synthesis reaction on poly(A)-mRNA in which an oligonucleotide (5'-32P)dC-T-T-C-T-C-C-A-C-A-TOH served as a primer and in which dideoxynucleoside triphosphates were used to reduce the size and heterogeneity of the cDNA products. The desired cDNA clone was isolated from a library of recombinant cDNA clones in the plasmid pBR322. The partial nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone corresponds to the amino acid sequence of HLA-B7 antigen. The approach described in this paper is extremely sensitive and may be useful in cloning other genes for which the corresponding mRNA is present at low levels. This cDNA clone is nearly full length and can be used to isolate and to study the genes within the HLA region and to obtain expression of HLA-B peptides in cells.Images	Isolation and partial nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone for human histocompatibility antigen HLA-B by use of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer.

We have isolated three cDNA clones for beta 2-microglobulin, the small subunit of the major histocompatibility antigens. beta 2-Microglobulin makes up less than 0.1% of mouse liver protein, and its mRNA is approximately 0.03% of liver poly(A)+ mRNA. The cDNA clones were identified by screening 1400 cDNA clones made from 9--10S mouse liver poly(A)+ mRNA. The procedure for screening the cDNA clones involved binding pooled plasmid DNA to nitrocellulose filters and testing the ability of each filter to select beta 2-microglobulin mRNA. The filter-selected mRNAs were assayed for their ability to direct the synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin in translation reactions in vitro. The isolated clones were shown by nucleotide sequence analysis to encode beta 2-microglobulin. The positive-selection--hybridization assay has been modified to facilitate the screening of large numbers of cDNA clones, and the modified assay should allow the isolation of cDNAs corresponding to any mRNA whose in vitro translation products can be immunoprecipitated. These modifications are of particular value in the isolation of cDNA clones corresponding to rare species of mRNA.Images	Mouse beta 2-microglobulin cDNA clones: a screening procedure for cDNA clones corresponding to rare mRNAs.

Mouse cells deficient in the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC 2.4.2.8) have been transfected with total human DNA, and cells producing human enzyme were isolated by growth in selective medium. DNA from several such cell lines has been used to generate secondary transfectants that make human HPRT. Blots of the DNA of these secondary cells have been hybridized with total human DNA probes or with cloned human Alu sequences, and one of several common bands has been cloned in pBR322. Colonies of transformed Escherichia coli containing human sequences were detected by their homology with human DNA, and subclones of resulting recombinant plasmids were prepared. Two subclones free of Alu sequences were found to contain human sequences that hybridized to human X chromosome DNA. One of these, pBR1.5, also hybridized to a single RNA band on gel blots of human and secondary transfectant cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNA but not to RNA from the parent mouse cell line. These results indicate that these clones represent human HPRT gene fragments. This has been confirmed by using pBR1.5 as a probe to isolate an authentic and expressible human HPRT cDNA clone from a library prepared by H. Okayama and P. Berg.Images	Isolation of a genomic clone partially encoding human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.	D J Jolly, A C Esty, H U Bernard, T Friedmann	6956912	1982-08-01	17	
Murine 3T6 selected in increasing concentrations of methotrexate were unstable with respect to dihydrofolate reductase overproduction and methotrexate resistance when they are cultured in the absence of methotrexate. An analysis of the karyotypes of these resistant cells revealed the presence of numerous double minute chromosomes. We observed essentially identical kinetics of loss of dihydrofolate reductase gene sequences in total deoxyribonucleic acid and in deoxyribonucleic acid from fractions enriched in double minute chromosomes and in the numbers of double minute chromosomes per cell during reversion to methotrexate sensitivity, and this suggested that unstably amplified gene sequences were localized on double minute chromosomes. This conclusion ws also supported by an analysis of cell populations sorted according to dihydrofolate reductase enzyme contents, in which relative gene amplification and double minute chromosome content were related proportionally.Images	Relationship of amplified dihydrofolate reductase genes to double minute chromosomes in unstably resistant mouse fibroblast cell lines.

Isolation of early viral transcriptional complexes and incorporation in vitro of radiolabeled precursors into nascent RNA has permitted an analysis of early simian virus 40 (SV40) transcription. Under conditions such that viral DNA replication was undetectable, both early and late SV40 RNA were synthesized. This finding provides evidence that viral DNA replication is not an absolute requirement for late transcription and supports earlier observations that late viral RNA is synthesized in SV40-infected nonpermissive mouse cells. The majority of the early viral transcriptional activity can be solubilized, indicating that a substantial portion of this RNA is transcribed from free rather than integrated templates. Sedimentation analysis of the transcriptional complexes resulted in the detection of two separate peaks of activity, suggesting the possibility of two distinct types of early SV40 templates.Images	Characterization of early simian virus 40 transcriptional complexes: late transcription in the absence of detectable DNA replication.

We have used the technique of DNA-excess filter hybridization to measure directly the content and metabolism of the mRNA for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3). The studies were conducted with a methotrexate-resistant derivative of mouse 3T6 fibroblasts (M50L3) that overproduces the enzyme and its mRNA by a factor of 300 but regulates the level of the enzyme during the cell cycle in the same manner as normal 3T6 cells. We found that, when resting (G0) M50L3 cells were serum-stimulated to reenter the cell cycle, the 10-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of DHFR that occurs at the beginning of S phase was the result of a corresponding increase in DHFR mRNA content. In pulse-labeling experiments, we found that there was a similar increase in the rate of production of the mRNA just prior to S phase. However, the half-life of the mRNA was the same (7.5 hr) in resting and exponentially growing cells. Therefore, the increase in DHFR mRNA content was due to an increase in the rate of production rather than an increase in the stability of the message. The delay between addition of [3H]-uridine to the culture medium and the emergence of DHFR mRNA from the nucleus was 15-20 min for both resting and growing M50L3 cells. A similar delay was observed for total mRNA. Therefore, the time required for the processing of newly synthesized DHFR heterogeneous nuclear RNA into DHFR mRNA is about the same as that for the average mRNA.

We used methotrexate-resistant mouse cells in which dihydrofolate reductase levels are approximately 500 times normal to study the effect of growth stimulation on dihydrofolate reductase gene expression. As a result of growth stimulation, the relative rate of dihydrofolate reductase protein synthesis increased threefold, reaching a maximum between 25 and 30 h after stimulation. The relative rate of dihydrofolate reductase messenger ribonucleic acid production (i.e., the appearance of dihydrofolate reductase messenger ribonucleic acid in the cytoplasm) increased threefold after growth stimulation and was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the relative steady-state level of dihydrofolate reductase ribonucleic acid in the nucleus. However, the increase in the nuclear level of dihydrofolate reductase ribonucleic acid was not accompanied by a significant increase in the relative rate of transcription of the dihydrofolate reductase genes. These data indicated that the relative rate of appearance of dihydrofolate reductase messenger ribonucleic acid in the cytoplasm depends on the relative stability of the dihydrofolate reductase ribonucleic acid sequences in the nucleus and is not dependent on the relative rate of transcription of the dihydrofolate reductase genes.

We have isolated as recombinant DNA clones, in the plasmid pBR322, regions of the herpesvirus type 1 genome spanning the region between 0.53 and 0.6 on the prototypical arrangement. This 11,000-base-pair region corresponds to 10% of the large unique region and encodes five major and several minor mRNA species abundant at different times after infection, which range in length from 7 to 1 kilobase. In this report, we have used RNA transfer blots and S1 nuclease digestion of hybrids between viral DNA and polyribosomal RNA to precisely localize (+/- 0.1 kilobase) these mRNA's. Comparison of neutral and alkaline gels of S1 nuclease-digested hybrids indicates no internal introns in the coding sequences of these mRNA's, although noncontiguous leader sequences near (ca. 0.1 kilobase) the 5' ends of any or all mRNA's could not be excluded. The 5' ends of several late mRNA's that are encoded opposite DNA strands map very close to one another, and the 3' ends of a major late and a major early mRNA, which are partially colinear, terminate in the same region. In vitro translation of the viral mRNA's isolated by hybridization with DNA bound to cellulose and fractionation of mRNA species on denaturing agarose gels allowed us to assign specific polypeptide products to each of the mRNA's characterized. Among other results, it was demonstrated unequivocally that two major late mRNA's, which partially overlap, encode the same polypeptide.Images	Detailed characterization of the mRNA mapping in the HindIII fragment K region of the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome.

The BglII N fragment of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) DNA (approximately 0.58 to 0.63 map unit) was examined for encoded products. Using plasmid pGZ59, which consists of BglII-N cloned in pAT153, in conjunction with hybrid arrested translation, mRNA selection, and in vitro protein synthesis, we found that the major translated product of this region has an approximate molecular weight of 37,800. By further mapping, coding sequences for this polypeptide were located within the region of BglII-N representing approximately 0.58 to 0.61 genome map unit. To demonstrate immunological specificity, we used staphylococcal A protein immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-HSV-1 or HSV-2 sera and antigens from HSV-1 or HSV-2 total mRNA translated in vitro and BglII-N-selected mRNA. The results show that the 37,800-dalton polypeptide has HSV-2 immunological specificity, as it is precipitated with anti-HSV-2 sera but not with anti-HSV-1 or control sera.Images	Identification of a virus-specific polypeptide associated with a transforming fragment (BglII-N) of herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA.

A 3' co-terminus of two early herpes simplex virus type 1 mRNAs has been identified using the nuclease -S1 mapping procedure with cloned virus DNA probes. These mRNAs (5.0 kb and 1.2 kb), located within the genome region 0.56-0.60, are unspliced and are transcribed rightwards on the prototype genome orientation. The position of their 3' ends has been located on the virus DNA sequence and lies downstream from the polyadenylation signal 5'-AATAAA-3'. This hexanucleotide sequence also was present in the complementary DNA strand and was shown to be the polyadenylation signal for a leftwards-transcribed late mRNA. The abundance within the cytoplasm of the 5.0 kb and 1.2 kb mRNAs was investigated. Results indicated that these mRNAs were regulated in concert. It is suggested that sequences at the 3' co-terminus may be involved in their regulation.Images	A 3' co-terminus of two early herpes simplex virus type 1 mRNAs.

Cloned BglII fragment N (map units 0.58 to 0.625) of herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA has been shown to transform rodent cells to an oncogenic phenotype (Galloway and McDougall, J. Virol. 38: 749-760, 1981). RNA homologous to this fragment directs the synthesis of five polypeptides in a cell-free translation system. The approximate molecular weights of these proteins are 140,000, 61,000, 56,000, 35,000, and 23,500. The 35,000-dalton protein is the major species late in infection and is the only species detected before the onset of viral DNA replication. The arrangement of the sequences encoding these proteins along the herpes simplex virus type 2 genome was determined by hybridization of the RNA to cloned PstI fragment of BglII-N and to single-stranded DNA segments cloned into M13mp7. Both the hybridization experiments and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies suggested that the 140,000- and 35,000-dalton proteins are at least partially colinear and share antigenic determinants.Images	Identification of proteins encoded by a fragment of herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA that has transforming activity.

RNA species, extracted at the time of peak synthesis of the alpha, beta, and gamma classes of herpes simplex virus polypeptides from lytically infected Vero cells, were examined for homology to the BglII-N fragment (map units 0.58 to 0.63) of herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA. By using northern blot analysis, two major and several minor polyadenylated RNA species showed homology to the BglII-N fragment at times corresponding to the maximum synthesis of the beta (7 h postinfection) and gamma (12 h postinfection) herpes simplex virus polypeptides. No alpha RNA homologous to the BglII-N fragment was detected.Images	Detection by RNA blot hybridization of RNA sequences homologous to the BglII-N fragment of herpes simplex virus type 2 DNA.

Polyadenylated immediate-early transcripts of herpes simplex virus type 1, made in BHK cells infected and maintained in the presence of cycloheximide, have been separated on denaturing agarose gels containing methyl mercuric hydroxide. Three virus-specific mRNA bands of estimated sizes 4.7, 3.0, and 2.0 kilobases (kb) were detected, and these mRNA's were mapped on the virus genome and also used to direct protein synthesis in vitro. The 4.7- and 3.0-kb mRNA's hybridized predominantly to certain DNA fragments which are located in the short and long repetitive regions of the genome, respectively, whereas the 2.0-kb mRNA's mapped to three discrete regions of the virus DNA. In vitro translation of these separated mRNA size classes indicated that the 3.0-kb mRNA specified the synthesis of virus polypeptide Vmw 110, whereas the 2.0-kb mRNA's specified Vmw 68, 63, and 12. The synthesis of small amounts of Vmw 175 was specified by the 4.7-kb mRNA. In contrast with the mRNA's which specify these other immediate-early polypeptides, that specifying Vmw 12 is much larger than required for its coding sequences.Images	Separation and characterization of herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early mRNA's.

A method is described for the production of hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies directed against the polyoma virus tumor antigens (T-Ags). Ten cloned lines have been established by this procedure and designated alpha Py Cl and C4, with activities against all three T-Ags; alpha Py LT1, -4 and -7, with activities against large T-Ag only; and alpha Py MT5, -7, -10, -13, and -16, with activities against middle T-Ag only. Some of the antibodies appear to react also with specific cellular protein. Data from studies on alpha Py MT7 point to the possible existence of more than one antigenic form of the viral middle T-Ag and, similarly, from studies on alpha Py LT7, to more than one form of large T-Ag. The approximate positions on the polyoma virus genome of the sequences encoding antigenic determinants have been mapped by using defined polyoma virus deletion mutants. The availability of these monoclonal antibodies allows the isolation of large amounts of viral T-Ags.Images	Monoclonal antibodies against polyoma virus tumor antigens.

Over 30 viral-specified polypeptides are translated in vitro from RNA of cells productively infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The polypeptides map to sites in EBV DNA by hybrid selection. Almost all of the polypeptides are reactive with EBV immune human serum. Several of the polypeptides are part of the early antigen complex. Two others are likely to be major structural components of the virus. Genes encoding persistent early and late polypeptides are intermixed through most of the EBV genome.Images	Mapping of polypeptides encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus genome in productive infection.

Mammalian cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) express a novel ribonucleotide reductase which is biochemically and immunologically distinct from the uninfected-cell enzyme. Using polyvalent rabbit antiserum raised against partially purified HSV type 2 reductase as well as monoclonal antibodies to HSV type 1 and HSV type 2 early antigens, we have been able to show that in both serotypes reductase activity is associated with phosphoproteins of molecular weights 144,000 and 38,000 encoded between map units 0.566 and 0.602 in the viral genomes. The major antigenic species (144,000) have been tentatively identified as HSV type 1 ICP6 and HSV type 2 ICP10.Images	Immunological characterization of herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 polypeptide(s) involved in viral ribonucleotide reductase activity.

Analysis of 35S-methionine-labeled extracts of adenovirus 2-infected KB cells revealed 22 virus-induced polypeptide components. Most proteins of the virion were easily detected in extracts of whole cells labeled for short periods between 15 and 30 h after infection; however, several virion components were conspicuously absent. Radioactivity appeared in two of these virion components during a chase in nonradioactive medium, and this appearance was paralleled by a decrease in the radioactivity associated with two nonvirion adenovirus-induced proteins, results which imply precursor-product relationships for these components. Comparison of one of the chasable adenovirus-induced components (designated P-VII; mass of 20,000 daltons) and the major core protein (VII; mass of 18,500 daltons) of the virion showed that they have four common methionine-containing tryptic peptides; P-VII has an additional methionine residue which is not found in the major core protein. We propose that at least two of the adenovirus 2 virion components are derived by the cleavage of higher molecular weight precursor polypeptides.Images	Processing of Adenovirus 2-Induced Proteins	C.

We measured the content and metabolism of histone mRNA in mouse 3T6 fibroblasts during a serum-induced transition from the resting to growing state. The content of several histone H3 and H2b mRNAs was measured by an S1 nuclease procedure. All of these increase in parallel by a factor of about 50 during S phase. However, the rate of H3 gene transcription increased only fivefold during this period, as determined in an in vitro transcription assay. This suggests that histone mRNA content is also controlled at the posttranscriptional level. When resting cells were serum stimulated in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, the rate of H3 gene transcription increased to about the same extent as that in control-stimulated cells. However, cytoplasmic H3 mRNA content increased only five to seven-fold. The half-life of H3 mRNA during S phase was about 4 to 5 h. When cytosine arabinoside was added to cells in the S phase, the half-life of the message decreased to about 15 min. The rapid turnover of H3 mRNA was prevented when the drug was added in the presence of cycloheximide or puromycin. The rate of H3 gene transcription decreased by only 35% after treatment with cytosine arabinoside. These results suggest that H3 gene transcription is not tightly coupled to DNA replication but is controlled temporally during the resting to growing transition. However, there is a correlation between the rate of DNA synthesis and the stability of histone H3 mRNA.Images	Regulation of histone mRNA production and stability in serum-stimulated mouse 3T6 fibroblasts.

The levels of histone mRNAs are reduced 90 to 95% after treatment of mouse myeloma cells with inhibitors of DNA synthesis which disrupt deoxynucleotide metabolism. In contrast, novobiocin, which inhibits DNA synthesis but does not alter deoxynucleotide metabolism, did not alter histone mRNA levels. Upon reversing the inhibition by fluorodeoxyuridine by feeding with thymidine, histone mRNA levels are restored to control levels within 40 to 60 min. The rate of histone gene transcription is reduced 75 to 80% within 10 min after treatment with fluorodeoxyuridine and increased to control levels within 10 min after refeeding with thymidine. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or puromycin in cells which had been treated with fluorodeoxyuridine resulted in an increase of histone mRNA levels. This was partly due to an increase in the rate of transcription. The data indicate that both transcription and mRNA degradation are linked to deoxynucleotide metabolism. Continued protein synthesis is necessary for maintaining the inhibition of histone gene transcription.Images	Rapid reversible changes in the rate of histone gene transcription and histone mRNA levels in mouse myeloma cells.

In attempting to understand the molecular basis of the control of chicken thymidine kinase (cTK) gene expression, we have examined the steady state cTK RNA content, and the patterns of DNA methylation, chromatin structure and endogenous nuclear runoff transcription of this gene in dividing and non-dividing cells. Our results reveal that the steady state level of cTK poly A+ RNA is correlated with the divisional activity of normal avian cells and tissues. However, no differences in the pattern of Hpa II site methylation or chromatin structure are found among cells containing high or undetectable levels of steady state cTK RNA. In addition, no differences in cTK transcription as assayed by nuclear runoff experiments are detectable in isolated nuclei derived from dividing or non-dividing cells containing high or low levels of steady state cTK RNA. These results suggest that the principal control of chicken thymidine kinase gene expression is post-transcriptional in nature.Images	Post-transcriptional regulation of the chicken thymidine kinase gene.

Primer extension analysis has been used to study the principal H4 mRNAs present at different developmental stages and in several adult tissues of Xenopus borealis and X. laevis. In X. borealis a single sequence class predominates in oocytes, tadpoles and cultured fibroblasts. There is also a polymorphic minor type which shows no developmental regulation. The primer extension bands obtained from adult liver and kidney RNA appear to be the same as ovary and therefore these tissues almost certainly contain the same major H4 mRNA species. This is confirmed by S1 mapping of the 3' end of the mRNA. Thus for H4 genes in X. borealis there is no evidence of the kind of switches in histone gene expression seen in sea urchins or certain protostomes. The situation in X. laevis is complicated by considerably higher gene variability both within and between individuals. Nevertheless, in this species, as in X. borealis, there seems to be no major developmental switch in the regulation of H4 gene expression, a conclusion that also holds for an H1C and an H3 gene.Images	Are there major developmentally regulated H4 gene classes in Xenopus?

We have examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition on histone gene expression during the HeLa cell cycle. Histone mRNAs, which normally are rapidly degraded in the absence of DNA synthesis, persist and increase in concentration when translation is inhibited before DNA replication is halted. This is not a function of polysomal shielding of these mRNAs from active degradation mechanisms since inhibitors of translation initiation alone effect stabilization and induction. The superinduction of histone mRNAs by protein synthesis inhibition is effective at the G1/S border, and in the S-phase and non-S-phase periods of the cell cycle. However, the relative increase in histone mRNA is greater when cells not synthesizing DNA are treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor than when S-phase cells are so treated. Non-histone mRNAs examined are not superinduced by translation inhibition. Transcription rates from both histone and non-histone genes increase after protein synthesis inhibition. Although the decrease in histone gene transcription associated with DNA synthesis inhibition is prevented and reversed by protein synthesis inhibition, we have no evidence that histone gene-specific transcriptional regulation is dependent on protein synthesis. Transcriptional increases may contribute to the superinduction effect but cannot explain its differential extent during the cell cycle, since these increases are similar when replicating or nonreplicating cells are treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor. We believe that changes in histone mRNA stability can account for much of the differential superinduction effect. Our results indicate a requirement for continuing protein synthesis in the cell cycle regulation of histone mRNAs.Images	Regulation of human histone gene expression during the HeLa cell cycle requires protein synthesis.

We have studied the metabolism of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) RNA in cells synchronized in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by starvation for isoleucine and glutamine. The relative content and stability of DHFR mRNA and the relative rate of transcription of the DHFR gene are similar in starved and exponentially growing cells. However, the relative rate of labeling of DHFR mRNA is about three times lower in starved cells than in exponentially growing cells. When the starved cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by feeding them with complete medium, the relative rate of labeling of DHFR mRNA increases about fourfold within 6 h. However, the relative rate of transcription of the DHFR gene changes very little during this period. Continuous labeling experiments show that starved cells convert DHFR heterogeneous nuclear RNA into cytoplasmic DHFR mRNA much more slowly than serum-limited or exponentially growing cells. Pulse-chase experiments show that DHFR mRNA sequences contained in DHFR heterogeneous nuclear RNA appear to be conserved in starved cells. In addition, the content of DHFR RNA sequences in the nuclei of starved cells is about three times greater than that in exponentially growing cells. Delayed processing of DHFR heterogeneous nuclear RNA is also observed when exponentially growing cells are treated with inhibitors of protein synthesis. Our results suggest that, although delayed processing leads to a decrease in the initial labeling rate of DHFR mRNA, it does not result in a decrease in the actual rate of production of the message.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) from encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus stimulates the incorporation of amino acids into protein in cell-free protein-synthetic systems derived from Krebs mouse ascites tumor cells and chick embryo fibroblasts; the mouse system is the more responsive to the viral RNA. The greater part of this difference in activity can be ascribed to the cell sap, but the origin of the ribosomes also has a marked effect. The nature of the polypeptides formed in these cell-free systems was investigated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and by fingerprint analysis of tryptic digests. The same product in part appears to be synthesized in response to the EMC RNA in both systems. It was not detected if the EMC RNA was partly degraded (≤4S) or replaced by other species of RNA, including that from influenza virus. The results suggest that EMC RNA is partially translated in these systems to yield virus-specific polypeptides.Images	Virus Protein Synthesis in Animal Cell-Free Systems: Nature of the Products Synthesized in Response to Ribonucleic Acid of Encephalomyocarditis Virus	Ian M.

The activity of ribosome and cell-sap fractions from interferon-treated and control chick embryo fibroblasts was compared in mixed chick-mouse and purely chick cell-free systems capable of the synthesis of viral polypeptide(s) in response to viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Interferon treatment of cells did not affect the intrinsic amino acid incorporation activity of these systems or their response to polyuridylic acid. With encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus RNA as messenger, however, a fraction of the ribosomes from interferon-treated cells appeared less active than parallel controls. The results obtained with the corresponding cell-sap fractions were variable. Although competition between endogenous and added messengers cannot be excluded in these systems, a reduced level of translation of EMC RNA with interferon-treated cell ribosomes was also suggested by the results of analyses of tryptic digests of the products formed in response to the RNA. In addition, these analyses showed that this reduced activity must reflect a reduction in the rate or frequency of translation rather than a decrease in the length of the EMC RNA translated, for the same polypeptides were synthesized in response to the RNA with material from interferon-treated and control cells. Interferon added directly to the cell-free system was without effect. Although suggestive, these results do not provide definitive evidence for or against the hypothesis that virus protein synthesis is inhibited at the translational level in the interferon-treated cell. Possible alternative interpretations of the data are discussed.Images	Protein Synthesis in Cell-Free Systems: an Effect of Interferon	Ian M. Kerr	4329562	1971-04-01	17	
Antisera, raised in rats, containing specificities directed against tumor antigen of polyoma virus also react with several proteins present in the plasma membrane of mouse cells infected with the virus. The main component has an apparent molecular weight of 55,000. The appearance of this protein after infection with early temperature-sensitive A mutants was temperature-dependent like tumor antigen itself. Pulse and chase isotope experiments suggest that this protein originates from a precursor, perhaps by cleavage; its production appears to be facilitated by the A mutation. Two other components with apparent molecular weights of 61,000 and 28,000 were also present but were more variable from experiment to experiment. All proteins were absent from the plasma membranes of cells infected with a transformation-defective mutant, NG-18. Up to four virus-specific proteins could be isolated from the plasma membranes of rat, hamster, and mouse cells transformed by the virus. The possible role of the plasma membrane proteins in cell transformation is discussed.Images	Virus-specific proteins in the plasma membrane of cells lytically infected or transformed by pol-oma virus.

Simian virus 40 (SV40) mRNA was isolated by hybridization of cytoplasmic RNA, from SV40-infected BS-C-1 monkey cells early in lytic infection, to SV40 DNA immobilized on Sepharose. The early viral mRNA, when added to a wheat-germ translation system, directed the synthesis of a unique class of products including a 90,000 molecular weight (Mr) polypeptide. It was found that this 90,000 Mr product as well as a prominent 17,000 Mr polypeptide could be specifically immunoprecipitated with hamster antiserum to SV40 T-antigen, but not with hamster control serum. Similar immunoprecipitation of extracts of SV40-infected cells with hamster anti-T serum yielded 90,000 Mr and 17,000 Mr polypeptides; these polypeptides were not found in immunoprecipitates of uninfected cell extracts. SV40 cRNA, prepared by asymmetric transcription of plaque-purified SV40 DNA, directed the cell-free synthesis of several products, including a 70,000 Mr polypeptide that could be specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-T serum. However, no T-antigen-related polypeptide was found in infected cells that corresponded in size to the major immunoprecipitated cRNA product.Images	Cell-free translation of simian virus 40 early messenger RNA coding for viral T-antigen.

The early region of simian virus 40 codes for at least two immunologically related polypeptides: large-T and small-t, with apparent molecular weights of 90,000-100,000 and 15,000-20,000, respectively. Because small-t shares methionine-containing tryptic peptides with large-T, the two polypeptides are probably coded, in part, by a common nucleotide sequence. To locate the coding sequences for large-T and small-t in the DNA, the production of these proteins was examined after infection of CV-1 cells with wild-type and deletion mutants of simian virus 40. We found that a deletion at the distal portion of the early region alters the structure of large-T but not of small-t; but deletions within the region between map coordinates 0.59 and 0.55 result in an alteration or absence of small-t and a normal large-T. These findings have been rationalized by a model that proposes the existence of two early mRNAs, one coding for large-T and the other for small-t. Both mRNAs span virtually the entire early region; but the mRNA coding for large-T lacks the nucleotide sequence between map coordinates 0.59 and 0.54. We suggest that small-t is translated from the larger of the two mRNAs, beginning at or near its 5′ end and terminating at a termination codon at about map coordinate 0.54. Larger-T, on the other hand, is translated from the shorter mRNA, beginning at the same initiator codon, and, because of the deletion of the terminator codon at 0.54, translation proceeds to the terminator codon at or near map position 0.18.Images	Organization and expression of early genes of simian virus 40	L.

When isolated by means of an anti-polyoma tumor (T) antiserum, the major product from mouse cells productively infected by wild-type polyoma virus is a polypeptide of 100,000 apparent molecular weight as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In cells infected by NG-18, an hr-t mutant carrying a deletion of about 150 base pairs in the early region of the viral DNA, a T antigen species appears that comigrates with that of the wild-type virus. Comparisons of peptides after partial proteolysis reveal no differences between mutant and wild-type products. Both wild-type and mutant 100,000 products can be labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate. An independent and more reliable estimate of the molecular weight of this protein using guanidine/Sepharose chromatography yields a value of 81,000 for both mutant and wild-type species. The apparent identity of wild-type and mutant products indicates that the deletion in NG-18 lies outside of the region encoding this major T antigen species.Immunoprecipitates from wild-type infected cells shows four bands in addition to the “100,000” band; these have apparent molecular weights of 63,000, 56,000, 36,000, and 22,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the 56,000 and 36,000 species are phosphorylated. All four of these lower molecular weight bands are absent or drastically reduced in the immunoprecipitates from NG-18-infected cells.Images	Tumor antigen(s) in cells productively infected by wild-type polyoma virus and mutant NG-18	Brian S.

A study of simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigens isolated from productively infected CV1 cells using a variety of different extraction procedures showed that under some conditions the highest molecular weight form of T-Ag (large-T) isolated comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with large-T from SV40-transformed H65-90B cells. Other faster-migrating forms of large-T are probably generated during the extraction procedure by a protease which is active at low pH, and such forms are probably experimental artifacts. After extraction under conditions which minimize proteolytic degradation of large-T, a further form of T-antigen was isolated; this has an apparent molecular weight in the range 15,000 to 20,000 and is referred to as small-t. Fingerprint analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled SV40 proteins showed that small-t has 10 to 12 methionine peptides whereas large-T has 15 to 18 methionine peptides. All but two of the methionine tryptic peptides present in small-t are also present in large-T. The fingerprint data also showed that T-antigens have no peptides in common with SV40 VP1. Experiments using reagents which inhibit posttranslational cleavage of encephalomyocarditis virus polyproteins showed that these reagents do not affect the synthesis of small-t and suggest that it is not made by proteolytic cleavage of large-T in vivo. An alternative model, which proposes that large-T and small-t are synthesized independently, is discussed in terms of the fingerprint data and the number of methionine tryptic peptides predicted from the primary sequence of SV40 DNA.Images	Extraction and fingerprint analysis of simian virus 40 large and small T-antigens.

We have constructed and cloned, in bacteria, recombinant plasmids containing DNA complementary to mRNA coding for a pancreatic pre-prosomatostatin, a product of the cell-free translation of pancreatic islet mRNAs shown previously by immunoprecipitation to be a precursor of somatostatin. A clone containing a nearly full-length cDNA insert of 550 base pairs was identified and appeared to contain the entire coding sequence for the somatostatin precursor in addition to portions of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. mRNA coding for the pre-prosomatostatin is 600-630 bases long as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization with labeled cDNA. Analyses of the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed a protein of 119 amino acid beginning with methionine followed by a typical leader sequence containing 18 hydrophobic amino acids. The tetradecapeptide somatostatin, identical in sequence to mammalian hypothalamic somatostatin, is located at the carboxy terminus followed immediately by a stop codon. An ARg-Lys sequence immediately preceding the sequence of somatostatin is typical of a prohormone cleavage site. A sequence Ala-Pro-Arg-Glu preceding the Arg-Lys cleavage site is identical to that found in porcine prosomatostatin. The evolutionary conservation of the identical amino acid sequence of the somatostatin tetradecapeptide from fish to mammals is remarkable. In addition, similar conservation, in fish and mammals, of the sequence Ala-Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys preceding the coding region for somatostatin suggets that this particular sequence may have biologic importance in cellular processing of the somatostatin precursor.Images	Nucleotide sequence of a cloned structural gene coding for a precursor of pancreatic somatostatin.

"Complementary DNA, transcribed in vitro from purified rabbit globin messenger RNA and made double-stranded, has been inserted into Escherichia coli plasmids pSC101 and pMB9 by the poly(dT)/poly(dA) ""tailing"" and annealing technique. E. coli transformants given by this DNA preparation have been shown to contain globin sequences by the hybridization of globin RNA to DNA from clones grown and lysed in situ on nitrocellulose filters. An estimate of the amount of inserted globin sequences has been provided by fingerprint analysis of globin mRNA sequences hybridized to the purified plasmid chimeras. Inserted sequences so far subjected to detailed analysis have been ascribed to the rabbit beta globin chain. The susceptibility of inserted beta globin, sequences to the restriction endonuclease EcoRI confirms the existence of a site already found through previous nucleotide sequence analysis.Images"	A general method for cloning eukaryotic structural gene sequences.

We have investigated whether the large (5- to 15-fold) stimulation of synthesis of growth hormone (somatotropin) observed upon exposure of a strain of rat pituitary (GH3) cells to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) arises from a stimulation of pregrowth hormone mRNA. A good agreement was observed between the stimulation of growth hormone synthesis and the stimulation of cytoplasmic levels of pregrowth hormone mRNA, assayed by translation in wheat germ extracts. Electrophoresis on formamide-acrylamide gels of oligo(dT)-treated membrane fraction RNA revealed a band that was induced by dexamethasone to about the same extent as was translatable pregrowth hormone mRNA. Elution of the band and translation in wheat germ extracts showed directly that it contained pregrowth hormone mRNA. These results suggest that the dexamethasone induction of growth hormone synthesis in GH3 cells arises from an accumulation of pregrowth hormone mRNA in the cytoplasm of the cells. The pregrowth hormone mRNA band observed by gel electrophoresis had an estimated molecular weight of 3.6 X 10(5), suggesting the existence in this molecule of an untranslated region at least 200 nucleotides in length.Images	Pregrowth hormone messenger RNA: glucocorticoid induction and identification in rat pituitary cells.

In a cell-free protein-synthesizing system from a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, total RNA extracted from cultured rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells directed, in a dose-related manner, the synthesis of proteins that were precipitated by antisera specific to rat growth hormone (somatotropin) and rat prolactin. A marked decrease in growth hormone secretion and growth hormone mRNA activity was observed when cells were grown in a medium deficient in thyroid hormone. Addition of triiodothyronine in physiologic amounts both prevented and completely reversed this effect within 48 hr. Thyroid hormone had no effect on prolactin secretion or prolactin mRNA activity. These data suggest that thyroid hormone may stimulate synthesis of growth hormone through induction of transcriptional activity. The possibility of an additional effect at the posttranscriptional level has not been excluded. Although thyroid hormone is believed to have a general effect on a variety of metabolic processes, some effects, at the molecular level, may be quite selective, as indicated by the observed changes in growth hormone but not prolactin mRNA activity. The GH3 cell model is useful in the study of triiodothyronine action because of independence from secondary hormonal effects caused by hypothyroidism and because simultaneous measurement of prolactin mRNA activity serves as a unique internal control.

Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones stimulate growth hormone synthesis in cultured rat pituitary cells (GC). We have compared changes in growth hormone production and mRNA in these cells. Triiodothyronine (10 nM) and dexamethasone (1 micron) stimulated increases in growth hormone production by 2.5- and 3.8-fold, respectively. There were corresponding increases in the capacity of RNA from hormone-treated cells to direct synthesis of pregrowth hormone in a wheat germ cell-free translation system, suggesting hormone-regulated increases in growth hormone mRNA. Hormone-induced changes in mRNA were also demonstrated by determining the kinetics of hybridization of a cDNA probe prepared from RNA enriched (about 70%) for growth hormone translational activity with RNA from control and hormone-treated cells. These results suggest that thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones can regulate growth hormone production by influencing the levels of its mRNA.Images	Regulation of growth hormone messenger RNA by thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones.

We have previously demonstrated that thyroid hormone controls growth hormone synthesis in GH1 cells and that the induction of the growth hormone response by glucocorticoid appears to be highly dependent on thyroid hormone action. Thyroid hormone induces growth hormone synthesis approximately 5- to 20-fold and cortisol increases this response 2- to 6-fold further. Long-term kinetics of the growth hormone response show that, without added thyroid hormone, cortisol can induce a small-growth hormone response after 48 hr of incubation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins synthesized in intact cells demonstrates that the cortisol enhancement of growth hormone synthesis in cells incubated with thyroid hormone is a relatively selective process. Quantitation of growth hormone mRNA levels by cell-free protein synthesis demonstrates that the regulation of growth hormone synthesis by thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones is explained by a synergistic pretranslational control mechanism, presumably at the level of the growth hormone gene.

Extracts of wheat germ are capable of synthesizing the major capsid protein of simian virus 40. Poly(A)-containing RNA from BS-C-1 cells infected with simian virus 40 directed the synthesis of a novel polypeptide that migrates in polyacrylamide gels together with the major capsid polypeptide of simian virus 40, VP-1. The patterns of the major tryptic peptides of purified VP-1 and the novel polypeptide synthesized in vitro were identical after two-dimensional paper electrophoresis. The novel polypeptide was not synthesized in response to poly(A)-rich RNA from uninfected cells or from virus-infected cells treated with cytosine arabinoside. Messenger RNA from infected cells purified by selective hybridization to DNA of simian virus 40 directs the synthesis of a major polypeptide of electrophoretic mobility similar to that of VP-1 of simian virus 40. This approach should prove useful in identifying additional products specified by DNA tumor viruses.Images	Cell-Free Translation of Messenger RNA of Simian Virus 40: Synthesis of the Major Capsid Protein	Carol L.

Growth hormone has been synthesized in a cell-free system derived from Krebs II ascites cells, under the direction of RNA prepared from rat pituitary tumor (GC) cells. Growth hormone synthesized in the cell-free system was identified by precipitation with antiserum against growth hormone developed in baboon, followed by electrophoretic analysis of the dissolved precipitate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. RNA from both the membrane and the post-membrane fractions of the cytoplasm of GC cells stimulated protein synthesis in the cell-free system, but only RNA from the membrane fraction was found to direct the synthesis of growth hormone.

Membrane fraction RNA isolated from rat pituitary tumor (GC) cells has been translated in a wheat germ extract. A product was synthesized which was immunologically related to growth hormone, but which migrated more slowly than growth hormone upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mobility of the cell-free product on gels of this type was unchanged by treatment with either KOH or RNase. The mobilities during paper electrophoresis of the methionine-containing tryptic peptides obtained from the cell-free product were identical to those obtained from growth hormone synthesized and secreted by the GC cells. Molecular weights for growth hormone and the cell-free product of 19,500 and 24,000, respectively, were determined by gel electrophoresis of these proteins together with marker proteins of known molecular weights. No protein with the properties of the cell-free product was detected after a 2 min incubation of the GC cells with [35S]methionine. However, treatment of the GC cells, with a protease inhibitor, L-1-tosylamide-2-phenyl-ethylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK), led to the appearance of a new polypeptide, immunologically related to growth hormone, and with a mobility on gels identical to that of the cell-free product. These results strongly imply that the cell-free product represents a growth hormone precursor (pregrowth hormone) which is rapidly converted to growth hormone in pituitary cells.

The order of transcription and the length of nascent RNA transcripts from adenovirus-2 (Ad-2) DNA in the nucleus of infected cells has been deduced by labeling the growing RNA chains in vivo for a very brief period, separating the RNA on the basis of size, and hybridizine to the ordered EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragments derived from Ad-2 DNA. The majority of the virus-specific RNA molecules are synthesized as very high-molecular-weight units beginning at a common point at least 25-30,000 base pairs from one end of the Ad-2 DNA. These molecules can be reduced in size without further RNA synthesis. The experiments indicate the obligatory origin of Ad-2 mRNA from a high-molecular-weight precursor molecule.

Late adenovirus messenger RNA was annealed to complementary regions of partially melted viral double-stranded DNA. The RNA. DNA hybrid regions within the DNA molecules were visualized as loops in the electron microscope. Loops occurred at several regions of the DNA, most frequently, however, at a location near the center of the molecule. This hybridization technique appears well suited for an accurate mapping of messenger RNA, as well as for studies of RNA processing.Images	Mapping of adenovirus messenger RNA by electron microscopy.

Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from cells productively infected with adenovirus type 2 was isolated by affinity chromatography on polyuridylic acid [poly (U)] bound to Sepharose. At least 90% of the polyadenylic acid [poly (A)]-containing polysomal mRNA was retained by the poly (U) Sepharose and thus separated from more than 95% of the ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. In these experiments, 65% of the early (3 to 5 hr postinfection) and 85% of the late (14 to 16 hr postinfection) virus-specific RNA was retained by the poly (U) Sepharose. Early in the infection 18%, and late in the infection more than 95%, of the poly (A)-containing fraction, eluted from the poly (U) Sepharose with 90% formamide, was adenovirus-specific, as shown by exhaustive hybridization. Different patterns, containing several distinct species of viral mRNA, were detected early and late in the infectious cycle. No distinct viral mRNA lacking poly (A) was discovered.

RNA was isolated from polyribosomes of cells double labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine and 32PO4 from 2 to 7 g postinfection in the presence of cycloheximide. Cycloheximide ensures that methylation and processing are performed by preexisting host cell enzymes. RNA was fractionated into polyadenylic [poly(A)]+ and poly(A)- molecules using poly(U)-Sepharose, and undergraded virus-specific RNA was isolated by hybridization to viral DNA in 50% formamide at 37 degrees C. Viral mRNA was digested with RNase T2 and chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex in 7 M urea. Two 3H-labeled RNase T2-resistant oligonucleotide fractions with charges between -5 and -6 were obtained, consistent with two classes of 5' terminal methyl ""cap"" structures, m7G(5')ppp(5')NmpNp (cap 1) and m7G(5')ppp(5')NmNmpNp (cap 2) (Nm is a ribose 2'-O-methylation). The putative cap 1 contains all the methylated constituents of cap 1 plus Cm. The molar ratios of m7G to 2'-O-methylnucleosides is about 1.0 for cap 1 and 0.5 for cap 2, consistent with the proposed cap structures. Most significant, compositional analysis indicates four different cap 1 structures and at least three different cap 2 structures. Thus there is a minimum of seven early viral mRNA species with different cap structures, unless each type of mRNA can have more than one 5' terminus. In addition to methylated caps, early mRNA contains internal base methylations, exclusively as m6A, as shown by analyses of the mononucleotide (-2 charge) fraction. m6A was present in the ratio of 1 mol of m6Ap per 450 nucleotides. Thus viral mRNA molecules contain two to three internal m6A residues per methyl cap, since there is on the average 1 cap per 1,250 nucleotides."

Adenovirus-specific nuclear and polysomal RNA, both early and late in the infectious cycle, contain a covalently linked region of polyadenylic acid 150-250 nucleotides long. A large proportion of the adenovirus-specific messenger RNA contains poly(A). As revealed by hybridization experiments, the poly(A) is not transcribed from adenovirus DNA. Furthermore, an adenosine analogue, cordycepin, blocks the synthesis of poly(A) and also inhibits the accumulation of adenovirus messenger RNA on polysomes. Addition of poly(A) to viral RNA may involve a host-controlled mechanism that regulates the processing and transport of messenger RNA.

The nuclear synthesis of adenovirus-specific RNA late in the infectious cycle in the presence of toyocamycin (an adenosine analogue) has been investigated. There is reduced synthesis of viral RNA with an accumulation of virus-specific RNA in the molecular weight range of at least 4 to 8 × 106. No new viral RNA associates with cytoplasmic polyribosomes. In addition, hybridization competition experiments indicate a 70% competition between these large nuclear transcripts and polyribosome-associated viral RNA that was synthesized in the absence of inhibitor. These data are consistent with the following interpretations: complete nuclear processing of viral RNA is necessary for polyribosome association, and precursor viral message(s) contain sequences that are lost normally during post-transcriptional processing.

RNA labeled with [methyl-3H] methionine and [14C]uridine was isolated from the cytoplasm of adenovirus-infected cells and purified by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography and hybridization to filters containing immobilized adeovirus DNA. Analysis by dimethyl sulfoxide-sucrose gradient sedimentation suggested that the major mRNA species were methylated. 7-Methylguanosine was identified at the 5'-terminus of the advenovirus-specific RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta-elimination. Structures of the type m7G(5')ppp(5')Nm containing the unusual nucleoside N6, O2'-dimethyladenosine, and smaller amounts of 2'-O-methyladenosine were isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography after P1 nuclease digestion of the RNA. Evidence for some 5'-terminal sequences, m7G(5')ppp(5')m6AmpNm, with additional 2'-O-methylribonucleosides was also obtained. A base-methylated nucleoside, N6-methyladenosine, is located within the RNA chain and is released as a mononucleotide by alkali hydrolysis.

Cytoplasmic RNA extracted from human tissue culture cells infected with adenovirus type 2 was used to program protein synthesis in a cell-free system derived from mammalian cells. Analysis of the protein product by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed ten adenovirus-specific polypeptides. Five of these were further identified by analysis of tryptic peptides. Translation of RNA fractionated by sedimentation through sucrose gradients containing formamide demonstrated seven size classes of RNA, each of which programmed the synthesis of only one or two virus-specific polypeptides. Six of the virus-specific polypeptides were translated from RNAs much larger than expected for the size of the polypeptide.Images	Cell-free Synthesis of Adenovirus 2 Proteins Programmed by Fractionated Messenger RNA: A Comparison of Polypeptide Products and Messenger RNA Lengths	C.

Adenovirus 2 mRNAs synthesized in productive infection were assigned to specific regions of the genome by hybridization to unique fragments of viral DNA. Radioactive viral RNA synthesized early or late in infection was first fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eluted RNAs were then tested for complementary hybrid formation with each of the six fragments of adenovirus 2 DNA generated by cleavage with endonuclease R·R1.Early RNA species migrating as 13S, 19S, and 20S RNAs were identified as transcription products of fragments A, B, and D, respectively. In addition to the 13S RNA transcribed from A fragment DNA, 13S RNA also hybridized to the D and E fragment DNAs; 11S RNA annealed to both A and B fragments. The RNA that hybridized to fragment C DNA was heterogeneous in size.Viral RNA synthesized late in infection included 27S, 24S, 19S, and 11S size classes, all of which annealed to A fragment DNA. Additional RNA migrating as 24S hybridized to E and C fragment DNA, and 23S RNA annealed to F fragment DNA.The results of the hybridizations of size fractionated RNAs with viral DNA fragments enabled formation of a partial map of viral mRNAs with respect to the adenovirus 2 genome. Some of the viral RNAs may represent transcripts which overlap R1 cleavage sites, because in at least three instances hybridization revealed viral RNAs which have the same electrophoretic mobility and anneal to fragments that are contiguous on the genome.

We demonstrate here the usefulness of cytochalasin B enucleate cells for the study of the metabolism of cytoplasmic mRNA and for determining its half-life in animal cells. Simian virus 40 infected monkey cells in which the RNA had been labeled with [3H]uridine were enucleated, and the decay of the two prominent RNAs of simian virus 40, the 19S and 16S species, was measured by analysis on sucrose gradients. The results of these experiments, together with kinetic analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic viral RNA, indicate a precursor-product relationship between the 19S and 16S cytoplasmic viral RNA species, which decay by first-order kinetics with a mean half-life of about 3 hr and 6 hr, respectively.

Infection of African green monkey kidney cells with type 5 adenovirus leads to the synthesis of two infected, cell-specific proteins with approximate molecular weights of 72,000 and 48,000, that bind specifically to single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. The production of these two proteins was studied after infection with two DNA-negative adenovirus mutants belonging to different complementation groups (H5 ts36 and H5 ts 125). Both DNA binding proteins were detected in cells infected with either mutant at the permissive temperature (32 C) AND ALSO IN H5 ts36-infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 C). In H5 ts125-infected cells at 39.5 C, however, less than 5% of the normal wild-type level of these DNA binding proteins was detectable. When H5 ts125-infected cells were labeled with radioactive leucine at 32 C and subsequently shifted to 39.5 C in the presence of unlabeled leucine (chase), the level of DNA binding proteins found in these infected cells was markedly reduced compared to cultures not shifted to 39.5 C. These data suggest that the DNA binding proteins themselves were temperature sensitive. This conclusion was confirmed by experiments in which the DNA binding proteins were eluted from DNA cellulose with buffers of increasing temperatures (thermal elution). The H5 ts 125 proteins were shown to elute at lower temperatures than either wild-type or H5 ts36 proteins. These results are taken to indicate that the H5 ts125 mutant codes for a DNA binding protein that is thermolabile for continued binding to single-stranded DNA.

Adenovirus 2 RNA synthesized early in productive infection was analyzed by RNA-DNA hybridization. Hybridization experiments were performed with adenovirus 2 DNA and wit, the six adenovirus 2 DNA fragments generated 0y digestion with the restriction endonuclease Eco R.R1. Duplex formation between RNA and -32P-labeled viral DNA was assayed by S(1) nuclease digestion. RNA from the cytoplasm annealed 12 percent of the total viral DNA and the following percentage of each of the R.R1 fragments: 6 percent of R1-A, 24 percent of R1-B, 0 percent of R1-F, 40 percent of R1-D, 13 percent of R1-E, and 22 percent of R1-C. The early cytoplasmic RNA is composed of two sequence classes: class I, present in greatly reduced quantities at late times in infection (18 h), and class II, which remains at high concentrations at 18 h. In hybridization-inhibition experiments, hybridization of class II RNA is inhibited by late cytoplasmic RNA, whereas hybridization of class I RNA is not blocked by late cytoplasmic RNA (J. J. Lucas and H. S. Ginsberg, 1971; E.A. Craig and H. J. Raskas, 1971). To determine the location of class I and II sequences on the genome, membrane bound DNA fragments were used in hybridization-inhibition experiments. These studies demonstrated that the early cytoplasmic transcripts of R1-D belong to class II, whereas R1-C transcripts are class I sequences. The cytoplasmic RNAs transcribed from fragments A and B contain both class I and class II sequences. Analysis of cytoplasmic RNA fractionated by size demonstrated that the class I sequences include a 19 S RNA transcribed from R1-B and class II sequences include a 20S RNA derived from R1-D. Nuclear RNA purified from cultures early in infection was annealed with -32P-labeled R1 fragments. With all six fragments the nuclear RNA annealed as much or more of the DNA than did cytoplasmic RNA. Eco R1-F annealed at least 25 percent with early nuclear RNA, whereas no sequences homologous to R1-F were detected in early cytoplasmic RNA. When cultures were labeled from 2 to 6 h after infection, at least 5 percent of the -3H-labeled early nuclear viral RNA annealed to Eco R1-F. Some of these nuclear transcripts from R1-F appear to be covalently linked to sequences transcribed from a contiguous region of the genome (Eco R1-B). 8.4 percent of the RNA selected by hybridization of R1-F reannealed to R1-B, whereas no more than 1.5 percent reannealed to R1 fragments A, D, E, or C.

A crude extract of commercial wheat germ is capable of translating mRNAs from widely different sources with high efficiencies. Of six wheat germs analyzed only one was found capable of a high level or incorporation with natural mRNAs. Under optimum conditions at a saturating level of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) RNA (4.5 μg) and labeled amino acid, 68% of all the available 14C leucine is incorporated in 70 min. at 30°C with a stimulation of 425 fold above background (with an efficiency of 252 moles leucine/mole TMV RNA). Thus this system which is 30 fold more efficient for TMV translation than previous reported wheat germ cell free systems is capable of yielding 568 pmoles of 14C leucine incorporated into protein in a 50 μl assay. 80% of the proteins produced have a molecular weight greater than TMV coat protein (17,400). This level of incorporation requires optimization of extract concentration, pH, Mg+2, K+ and spermine concentration as well as the method of extract preparation.Samples of crude polysomal RNA from hen oviducts (3% mRNA) and chorionating moth follicular cells (1% mRNA) are also translated in the wheat germ cell free system with high efficiency.

"The region of the simian virus 40 genome complementary to the 5' end of the most abundant poly(A)-containing 19S and 16S mRNAs was mapped by hybridization of double-labeled RNA ([3H]methyl group and [14C]uridine) to specific DNA fragments. Chemical identification of methylated residues indicated that a common ""leader"" sequence adjacent to the 5' terminus of both 19S and 16S mRNA is transcribed from DNA sequences located between 0.67 and 0.76 map units. The estimated size of this ""leader"" RNA, which does not code for any known viral protein, is 170-200 nucleotides. Our results indicate that sequences complementary to the ""leader"" region and coding portion of 16S mRNA are located in separate parts of the simian virus 40 genome.Images"	5'-Terminal sequences and coding region of late simian virus 40 mRNAs are derived from noncontiguous segments of the viral genome.

Late cytoplasmic RNAs specified by two regions of the adenovirus 2 genome (39.3--51.8 and 70.7--83.4 map units) were analyzed by size fractionation of poly(A)-[3H]RNA and subsequent hybridization to DNA fragments. Both regions encode RNAs whose sequence content exceeds the coding capacity of the region. These multiple transcripts are likely to function as mRNAs, because they are present on polyribosomes. The DNA segment 39.3--51.8 specifies 27S, 22S, and 18S RNAs. The genome sites specifying these three size classes were determined by hybridizations with seven different DNA fragments from this region of the genome. The 3' termini of all three size classes are specified by sequences near a common site, position 50.1. The 27S RNA includes sequences beginning near 39.3, the 22S RNA contains sequences from 41.0, and the 18S RNA includes sequences from approximately 45.3 on the unit genome. A second family of four RNAs is transcribed from 70.7--83.4. These 28S, 22S, 18S, and 16S RNAs have a relationship similar to the RNAs transcribed from 39.3--51.8. Sequences near the 5' ends of these four size classes are specified by different genome sites. However, the 3' termini of all four size classes were localized near map position 80.4. The synthesis of families of RNA may allow the translation of multiple polypeptides from a genome segment that has only one terminator site for mRNA synthesis.

Viral mRNA species synthesized early in adenovirus type 2 infection in the presence of cycloheximide were compared with those synthesized in the absence of drug or in the presence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Cycloheximide caused approximately a 10-fold stimulation in the accumulation of [3H]uridine into early viral mRNA species. The only exception was a 24s mRNA transcribed from the transforming end of the genome; in the presence of cycloheximide, accumulation of this mRNA species was stimulated no more than 2-fold. Treatment with cycloheximide also resulted in the accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs transcribed from EcoRI-C that are heterogeneous and smaller than the 20S mRNA. Other translation inhibitors were shown to have similar effects, suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis early after infection induces alterations in the metabolism of specific RNA sequences.

Adenovirus type 2 cytoplasmic RNAs synthesized late in productive infection were resolved by electrophoresis on formamide gels. Regions of the adenovirus 2 genome specifying RNAs of distinct size were determined by hybridization to specific DNA fragments generated by cleavage with endo R·EcoRI and endo R·SmaI. From these studies 13 distinct viral RNA species were identified. A 26S to 28S size class and a 21S to 23S size class were each found to consist of four distinct RNA species. Three RNA species were identified in a 16S to 18S size class, and a fourth size class, 11S to 13S, was resolved into two components. The SmaI-D region (0.38 to 0.51 on the unit genome) and the EcoRI-F, D region (0.70 to 0.83) of the genome were found to code for multiple transcripts. Three RNAs (28S, 22S, and 18S) are specified by SmaI-D, and four components, 28S, 22S, 18S, and 16S, are encoded by EcoRI-F,D. The RNA represented by each set of multiple transcripts exceeds the coding capacity of the respective region, and the species within each set of RNAs appear to contain common sequences. The relationship between the cytoplasmic RNA species synthesized at late times and early cytoplasmic RNAs was determined by hybridization-inhibition experiments. The multiple transcripts encoded by the EcoRI-D fragment were found to contain sequences that are present in early cytoplasmic RNA. These studies enabled preparation of a map which accounts for transcription of approximately 67% of the r strand of the adenovirus 2 genome.

mRNA extracted from polysomes of KB cells at late stages of productive infection with adenovirus type 2 was translated in a cell-free system derived from Krebs II ascites cells. Two of the polypeptides obtained in this reaction corresponded to the adenovirus core protein V and the precursor to core protein VII. The following criteria were used to establish identity between the in vitro products and the virion proteins: comigration during sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cochromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate-hydroxyapatite, specific immunoprecipitation of the precursor to core protein VII, and tryptic peptide analysis.Images	In Vitro Synthesis of Adenovirus Core Proteins	Larry Eron, Heiner Wesphal, Robert Callahan	4211166	1974-08-01	17	
Several polypeptides contained in the coat and the core of adenovirus type 2 particles have been identified as virus gene products. They are synthesized in vitro by a cell-free protein-making system programmed by adenovirus type 2 messenger RNA that has been hybridized with and eluted from virus DNA. Fractionation by size yields subpopulations of viral messenger RNA that differ in their coding specificities. The procedures outlined in this study may be used to establish a genetic map of adenovirus type 2.Images	Cell-Free Translation of Highly Purified Adenovirus Messenger RNA	Larry Eron, Heiner Westphal	4530310	1974-09-01	17	
The complementary strands of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) DNA were separated by buoyant density gradient centrifugation with poly (U, G). The complementary strand DNA was shown to remain intact through the course of strand separation. The l-strand of Ad2 DNA, appearing in the less dense complex with poly (U, G) in neutral CsCl density gradients, was shown to have a buoyant density in alkaline (pH 12.5) CsCl density gradients which is 2 to 3 mg per ml greater than that of its complement (h-strand). Renaturation of purified complementary strand DNA was observed only in mixtures of h- and l-strand DNA, and then with the second-order reaction rate expected for Ad2 DNA. Hybridization of the complementary strands of Ad2 DNA with cytoplasmic mRNA isolated from infected HeLa cells was performed in liquid phase and analyzed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Before viral DNA synthesis (6 h after infection), 13 to 18% of the h-strand and 30 to 35% of the l-strand were represented in viral mRNA. Late (18 h) after infection the mRNA represented 20 to 25% and 63 to 68% of the h- and l-strands, respectively. Most, if not all sequences present in viral mRNA before viral DNA synthesis were also present in the cytoplasm late in infection.

Adenovirus type 2 mRNA was translated in S30 extracts from Ehrlich ascites and wheat embryo cells. The in vitro products were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis after immunoprecipitation with specific antisera in the presence of urea. Seven virion polypeptides could be identified by immunoprecipitation. Three of these appear to be precursors to polypeptides of the virion. mRNA isolated late in adenovirus infection was separated into three size classes by zonal sedimentation. Material sedimenting at 26S was translated into polypeptides corresponding to the largest virion polypeptides II to IV, a 22S fraction corresponding to polypeptide V, and smaller polypeptides and a 15S fraction corresponding to polypeptide IX. A significant amount of polypeptide IX was also synthesized by the 26S and 22S RNA.Images	Identification of the in vitro translation products of adenovirus mRNA by immunoprecipitation.

Adenovirus 2-transformed cells contain virus-specific sequences which are covalently linked to cell-specific RNA sequences in heterogeneous nuclear RNA (HnRNA) molecules larger than 45S. Virus sequences are identified by hybridization to viral DNA, and the cell sequences are detected by hybridization to cellular DNA under conditions where hybridization only occurs to reiterated sites in cell DNA. Such large composite viral-cell HnRNA molecules presumably arise through the uninterrupted transcription of host sequences and integrated viral DNA. Adenovirus-specific polysomal RNA from these cells sediments as three discrete species at 16, 20, and 26S. These specific classes of viral mRNA do not contain rapidly hybridizing host-specific RNA sequences. Both virus-specific HnRNA and mRNA contain polyadenylic acid sequences since they bind to polyU columns at levels characteristics of other polyA-terminated HnRNA and mRNA. Thus, the discrete species of virus-specific mRNA in adenovirus 2 transformed cells appear to be derived from high-molecular-weight virus-specific HnRNA through a series of post-transcriptional modifications involving polyA addition. Subsequently the HnRNA is cleaved so that the cell-specific RNA sequences that originate from the reiterated sites in cell DNA do not accompany the adenovirus mRNA to the cytoplasm. These events for the adenovirus-specific mRNA appear, therefore, to be similar to the stages in the biogenesis of the majority of mRNA in eukaryotic cells.

The hydroxylation of lysine and glycosylations of hydroxylysine were studied in isolated chick-embryo tendon and cartilage cells under conditions in which collagen triple-helix formation was either inhibited or accelerated. The former situation was obtained by incubating the tendon cells with 0.6mm-dithiothreitol, thus decreasing their proline hydroxylase activity by about 99%. After labelling with [14C]proline, the formation of hydroxy[14C]proline was found to have declined by about 95%. Since the hydroxylation of a relatively large number of proline residues is required for triple-helix formation at 37°C, the pro-α-chains synthesized under these conditions apparently cannot form triple-helical molecules. Labelling experiments with [14C]lysine indicated that the degree of hydroxylation of the lysine residues in the collagen synthesized was slightly increased and the degree of the glycosylations of the hydroxylysine residues more than doubled, the largest increase being in the content of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. Recovery of chick-embryo cartilage cells from temporary anoxia was used to obtain accelerated triple-helix formation. A marked decrease was found in the extent of hydroxylation of the lysine residues in the collagen synthesized under these conditions, and an even larger decrease occurred in the glycosylations of the hydroxylysine residues. The results support the previous suggestion that the triple-helix formation of the pro-α-chains prevents further hydroxylation of lysine residues and glycosylations of hydroxylysine residues during collagen biosynthesis.

We have used a specific deoxyoligonucleotide probe to detect gastrin mRNA in poly(A)-enriched RNA preparations from hog antrum. The nucleotide sequence of the oligonucleotide, d(C-T-C-C-T-C-C-A-T-C-C-A), was deduced from the unique amino acid sequence Trp-Met-Glu-Glu of gastrin. When used with hog antral RNA, the dodecanucleotide is an effective primer for the synthesis of gastrin-specific cDNA as judged by nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have determined an 81-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the region of the gastrin mRNA that codes for the known amino acid sequence of the G34 progastrin intermediate species, and we have demonstrated the presence of two consecutive basic residues preceding the G34 sequence in the prohormone. Hybridization of gastrin cDNA or synthetic dodecanucleotide to hog antral RNA separated by gel electrophoresis on agarose gels in the presence of methylmercuric hydroxide indicates that the mRNA coding for gastrin is about 620 nucleotides long. These results suggest that the gastrin precursor peptide contains 110-140 amino acids. This method should be of general application for detection and characterization of mRNAs corresponding to proteins of known amino acid sequence.Images	Detection and partial sequence analysis of gastrin mRNA by using an oligodeoxynucleotide probe.

We have used a synthetic deoxydecanucleotide to generate an insulin-specific cDNA probe suitable for selecting transformants that contain nearly full-length cDNAs corresponding to the mRNAs coding for rat insulins I and II. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from x-ray-induced rat insulinoma poly(A)-RNA, inserted in pBR322 plasmid DNA by the homopolymeric tailing technique, and cloned in Escherichia coli chi 1776. Colony hybridization with oligonucleotide-primed cDNA yielded 16 positive clones of which 7 corresponded to rat insulin I mRNA and 9 to rat insulin II mRNA. Restriction endonuclease maps of representative clones of each group indicated that these contained the complete coding sequences, as was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5' region of the cloned DNA for rat insulin II. Nucleotide sequence analysis also established the amino acid sequence of the prepeptide of rat preproinsulin II. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the prepeptides of rat preproinsulin I and II shows that three conservative amino acid substitutions have occurred in this region of the molecule.Images	Construction and selection of recombinant plasmids containing full-length complementary DNAs corresponding to rat insulins I and II.

A cDNA cloning approach was used to investigate muscle gene regulation during differentiation of cultured embryonic quail myoblasts. A cDNA clone library of cultured myofiber poly(A)+RNA was constructed and screened by colony hybridization with cDNA probes of myoblast and myofiber RNA. Twenty-eight myofiber-specific cDNA clones were identified and, by cross-hybridization analysis, these clones were found to represent, at most, 18 different myofiber-specific RNAs. Six of these RNAs were identified by sequence analysis of the cDNA clones. These six RNAs encode the contractile proteins alpha-actin, alpha-tropomyosin, myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain 2, troponin C, and troponin I. The embryonic muscle contractile protein sequences are identical with, or closely match, those of adult skeletal muscle proteins and include both fast fiber (myosin light chain 2 and troponin I) and slow fiber (troponin C) isotypes. RNA gel transfer hybridization analysis showed that the cellular abundances of these contractile protein mRNAs increase 20- to 30-fold or more during myoblast differentiation. These findings indicate that coordinate activation of contractile protein synthesis during myogenesis is controlled by mechanisms that direct the accumulation of contractile protein mRNAs rather than their translational utilization. Furthermore, with the possible exception of myosin heavy chain, the contractile protein genes expressed by cultured embryogenic muscle encode adult muscle proteins of both basal and slow fiber types, consistent with a co-activation-selective repression model of gene regulation during fiber type differentiation in developing skeletal muscle.Images	cDNA clone analysis of six co-regulated mRNAs encoding skeletal muscle contractile proteins.

"Two approaches have been explored for the synthesis of double-stranded DNA from single-stranded DNA template complementary to rabbit 9S globin mRNA (cDNA). (i) cDNA was elongated with dCMP or dTMP homopolymeric tracts using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.31; nucleosidetriphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidylexotransferase). cDNA-dC, in the presence of an oligo(dG)10 primer, was an efficient template with either DNA polymerase of Escherichia coli (EC 2.7.7.7; deoxynucleosidetriphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase) or RNA-directed DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus. cDNA-dT [ with an oligo(dA)10 primer] functioned as template only with E. coli polymerase. (ii) cDNA, without homopolymeric tails, was also efficiently copied in the absence of oligonucleotide primer, by DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus or of E. coli. The product of the reaction consisted of long hairpin molecules which could be converted into DNA duplex (melting temperature, 93 degrees) by digestion with single-strand nuclease S1. The data indicate that a loop structure on the 3' end of cDNA allowed DNA synthesis to take place by a ""self-priming"" mechanism. Some of the double-stranded DNA synthesized corresponded to the entire sequence of the 9S mRNA template.

We have shown previously that immunoglobulin M (IgM) is present within IgM-forming cells mainly in its 7S subunit form (IgMs), whereas only fully assembled IgM pentamers are secreted. There is no spontaneous polymerization of intracellular IgMs in cell lysates, suggesting that the 7S subunits had blocked cysteine residues. This suggestion was explored and confirmed in the present paper. Radioactive IgM (secreted) and IgMs (intracellular) were prepared by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation after incubation of cells of the IgM-producing mouse myeloma MOPC 104E with [3H]leucine. We investigated the susceptibility to reduction of fully assembled mouse IgM and its reconstitution from subunits by analysis by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under dissociating conditions. With increasing concentrations of dithioerythritol, interchain disulphide bonds were cleaved in the following order: inter-IgMs subunit, intra-IgMs subunit H-H, intra-IgMs subunit H-L. Removal of the reducing agent from IgM-reduction mixtures by filtration through Sephadex G-25 caused partial reconstitution of IgM at low protein concentrations (5–100μg/ml) and total reconstitution at higher protein concentrations (300μg/ml or more). Isolated radioactive intracellular IgMs showed no tendency to polymerize unless first treated with a reducing agent; under optimum conditions removal of the reducing agent caused 70% of the subunits to be assembled into IgM. Similar assembly occurred when IgMs was isolated from cells that had been lysed in the presence of an irreversible alkylating reagent (iodoacetamide). The intracellular IgMs cysteine residues responsible for inter-IgMs linkage therefore appear to be reversibly blocked within the cells. Assembly into IgM is thus controlled by removal of this block during secretion.ImagesFig. 1.	Assembly of immunoglobulin M. Blocked thiol groups of intracellular 7S subunits	Brigitte A. Askonas, R. M.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) biosynthesis was studied with mouse plasma-cell tumour MOPC 104E as a model system. Cell suspensions prepared from solid tumours were incubated in vitro with [3H]leucine; the radioactivity incorporated into intracellular and secreted proteins was analysed by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The tumour secretes IgM and light chains. `Pulse–chase' experiments indicated average secretion times of 1.5h for light chain and 2.5h for IgM. The order of disulphide-bond assembly within the cell was shown to be heavy chain+light chain → heavy chain–light chain intermediate → IgMs. The 7S subunit (IgMs) was polymerized into IgM just before or at the time of secretion. Measurements of heavy-chain/light-chain radioactivity ratios in intracellular HL and IgMs and secreted IgM demonstrated the existence of a light-chain pool participating in IgM biosynthesis. The size of the light-chain pool, together with analysis of clones isolated in vivo, suggested that the tumour contains cells in which light-chain synthesis is in excess of heavy-chain production.

Incorporations of radioactive mannose, galactose and fucose into MOPC 104E mouse plasma-cell tumour suspensions suggest a stepwise addition of carbohydrate residues to immunoglobulin M (IgM) during the process of secretion. Mannose and glucosamine residues are added at an early stage, whereas galactose and fucose are added just before, or at the time that, IgM leaves the cell. Free light chains secreted in excess by the same tumour cells incubated with mannose, galactose or fucose contained barely detectable amounts of radioactivity.

Cell suspensions of mouse plasma-cell tumour MOPC 315 secreting predominantly IgA (immunoglobulin A) monomer and dimer were incubated with radioactive leucine, mannose, galactose and fucose for various periods of time. The amounts of secreted and intracellular immunoglobulins were measured by co-precipitation with specific antibody, and the molecular species present were assessed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of the secreted myeloma protein demonstrated that monomer and dimer IgA molecules are identical with respect to carbohydrate composition and rate of secretion. Within the cell, the myeloma protein is almost entirely accounted for by monomer units which either leave the cell as such or are polymerized with the addition of J chain close to the time of secretion. The results support the concept of a stepwise addition of carbohydrate residues to IgA immunoglobulin during the process of secretion. Similar patterns of carbohydrate assembly were found for the monomer or dimer molecules. Mannose residues are added at an early stage, whereas fucose is added close to the time of secretion. Galactose is also added early, but some may also be incorporated at a later stage. Control of IgA polymerization is considered unlikely to reflect regulation at the level of carbohydrate addition, and it is suggested that the critical controlling factor is the J chain.

The statistical implications of the direct linear plot for enzyme kinetic data, described in the preceding paper (Eisenthal & Cornish-Bowden, 1974), are discussed for the case of the Michaelis–Menten equation. The plot is shown to lead directly to non-parametric confidence limits for the kinetic parameters, V and Km, which depend on far less sweeping assumptions about the nature of experimental error than those implicit in the method of least squares. Median estimates of V and Km can also be defined, which are shown to be more robust than the least-squares estimates in a wide variety of experimental situations.

The stoichiometry of J chain in pentamer IgM has been determined by measuring the radiolabeled thiols in the constituent chains after complete reduction and alkylation of the polymer. One mole of J was found to be disulfide bonded to 1 mol of pentamer. The linkage of J chain in IgM has been determined by correlating the J disulfides cleaved with the subunits released after limited reduction and alkylation of the polymer. The analyses showed that: (a) Significant amounts of monomers, as well as small quantities of dimers, trimers, and tetramers, were generated by the reducing conditions employed. (b) The number of J disulfide bonds broken did not correspond to the extent of depolymerization. (c) No J disulfides were cleaved in the J-containing dimer products of the limited reduction. These data demonstrated that the J chain is located as a disulfide clasp between two of the IgM monomer subunits. From the observed linkage, the assembly of IgM is postulated to proceed by a series of sequential disulfide exchanges beginning with the formation of the J-containing dimer.Images	Mechanism of IgM Polymerization	Rose Marie Chapuis, Marian Elliott Koshland	4207070	1974-03-01	17	
1. Isolation of free and membrane-bound ribosomes from embryonic chick sternal-cartilage cells labelled for 4min with [14C]proline and their subsequent analysis for hydroxy[14C]proline indicated that cartilage procollagen biosynthesis occurs on bound ribosomes. 2. Nascent procollagen polypeptides on bound ribosomes isolated from cells labelled with [14C]lysine were found to contain hydroxy[14C]lysine indicating that hydroxylation of lysine commences while the growing chains are still attached to the ribosomes. 3. Analysis of bound ribosomes labelled with either [14C]proline or [14C]lysine on sucrose density gradients indicated that cartilage procollagen is synthesized on large polyribosomes in the range 250-400S. 4. Microsomal preparations isolated from cells pulse-labelled for 4 min with [14C]proline were used to determine the direction of release of nascent procollagen polypeptides. Puromycin induced the vectorial release of nascent procollagen polypeptides into the microsomal vesicles suggesting that the first step in the secretion of procollagen polypeptides is their transfer from the ribosomes through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cisternal space. 5. The procollagen polypeptides secreted by cartilage cells were shown to be linked by inter-chain disulphide bonds. 6. Examination of the state of aggregation of pro-alpha chains in subcellular fractions isolated from cartilage cells labelled with [14C]proline for various periods of time have provided data on the timing and location of inter-chain disulphide-bond formation. This process commences in the rough endoplasmic reticulum after the release of completed pro-alpha chains from membrane-bound ribosomes. Pro-alpha chains isolated from fractions of smooth endoplasmic reticulum were virtually all present as disulphide-bonded aggregates, suggesting that either disulphide bonding is completed in this cellular compartment, or that procollagen needs to be in a disulphide-bonded form to be transferred to this region of the endoplasmic reticulum. 7. Comparison of these results with previously published data on disulphide bonding in tendon cells suggest that the rate of inter-chain disulphide-bond formation is significantly slower in cartilage cells.

Purified IgM isolated from the serum of mice bearing the transplantable plasmacytoma MOPC 104E was reduced and alkylated and then analysed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and by sodium dodecyl sulphate—polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On partial reduction a mixture of IgM subunits was obtained in the absence of covalently linked 19S IgM. When examined under dissociating conditions this mixture was found to consist of disulphide-linked 7S subunits (IgMs), small amounts of HL subunits and oligomeric IgM of a size intermediate between monomeric and pentameric IgM. In the absence of a dissociating agent and on sucrose density gradient, however, the mixture resolved into a 19S and a 7S peak. The 19S peak consisted primarily of oligomeric IgM and IgMs with small amounts of HL subunits. Thus alkylated IgMs and HL subunits of IgM can associate through non-covalent forces to form a molecule sedimenting at 19S, providing oligomeric forms are present. In the absence of oligomeric forms, IgMs, HL subunits and heavy and light chains sediment at about 7S. The products of partial reduction which sediment at 7S and 19S could also be isolated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When this was done J chain was absent in the former and present in the latter, raising the possibility that J chain does not disulphide bond to each of the five IgMs subunits, constituting an IgM molecule. Thus, within cells secreting IgM, J chain would be expected to mediate the formation of an oligomeric form of IgM. Once the oligomeric structure has been assembled, then non-covalent forces between this and IgMs subunits will cause the formation of a 19S structure, thereby facilitating the final assembly through disulphide bonds.ImagesFIG. 4FIG. 2FIG. 6	Non-covalent association of IgM subunits produced by reduction and alkylation	R.

Mouse IgM (immunoglobulin M) was selectively and partially reduced and treated with iodo[2-14C]acetate to label the interchain disulphide bridges. The carboxymethylation was studied in some detail. The labelled peptides were purified, sequenced and positioned by homology with human IgM. Only peptides originating from three interchain disulphide bridges were labelled, in contrast with the four labelled bridges obtained in human IgM under the same conditions. These peptides are homologous to human bridge peptides forming the heavy-light bridge and two inter-heavy bridges, one present in the CMU2 region and the other in the C-terminal region. The inter-heavy bridge in the Cmu2 region was alone cleaved and radioactively labelled in selectively reduced IgM held together as a pentamer by non-covalen interactions. The same bridge was the only one to be totally cleaved in subunits released after more extensive, though still selective, reduction. In the light of these results a possible arrangement of the disulphide bridges of the mouse IgM.ImagesPLATE 4PLATE 1PLATE 2PLATE 3	Interchain disulphide bridges of mouse immunoglobulin M.

Subcellular fractions were obtained from rat liver homogenates under conditions which prevented degradation of polysomes (pH 8.5 and high ionic strength). Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) was recovered in high yields from a low-speed nuclear pellet (rapidly sedimenting endoplasmic reticulum, RSER) and from a postmitochondrial supernate (rough microsomes). The polysomal RNA content of these two fractions was very similar. When polyA+-RNA's were translated inthe mRNA- dependent wheat embryo cell-free system, both fractions yielded polypeptide products which had similar electrophoretic patterns on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Activities of messenger RNA's which code for albumin and for polypeptides destined for transport to the inner membrane and matrix of mitochondria (i.e. 'mitoplasts') were assayed by translating in the more active rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system followed by immunoprecipitation of radioactive products and coelectrophoresis with immunoprecipitated marker proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These tests indicated that albumin mRNA is about equally distributed between the two fractions of RER, or slightly enriched in the RSER fraction when activity is expressed as a percentage of total polypeptide synthesis. Activities of cytoplasmic mRNA's which code for at least some mitoplast proteins could be detected in both fractions, but all were enriched in the rough microsome fraction, not the RSER (two- to threefold when corrected for differences in total polypeptide synthesis in the lysate). Comparisons of mRNA's from free vs. membrane-bound polysomes indicated that most of the albumin mRNA activity (86-91%) and mitoplast protein mRNA activities (75%) were present in the bound fraction. Assuming that RSER and rough microsomes do not derive exclusively from different cells types, the evidence suggests that, compared to albumin and most other membrane-bound mRNA's, cytoplasmic mRNA's coding for mitoplast proteins may be preferentially segregated or compartmentalized within the cell on the microsomal class of RER.

The purification of human placenta and rat liver protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) and the production of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against these proteins are described. The physical and enzymic properties of human PDI and rat PDI were similar; immunological characterization revealed the presence of unique, as well as shared, antigenic determinants. Although purified rat liver PDI was present as three forms differing slightly in Mr value, evidence was presented that the multiple forms represent proteolytic degradation products of a single 59,000-Mr species. Purified human PDI had an apparent Mr of 61,200. Two of the monoclonal antibodies against human PDI partially inactivated the enzyme, and one of these in indirect immunoprecipitation led to the precipitation of all glutathione:insulin transhydrogenase activity from a crude extract of human placenta. Results of immunofluorescence experiments with HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells were consistent with localization of PDI in the nuclear membrane and cell cytoplasm.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

Protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) activity was not detectable in freshly prepared rat liver microsomes (microsomal fraction), but became detectable after treatments that damage membrane integrity, e.g. sonication, detergent treatment or freezing and thawing. Maximum activity was detectable after sonication. Identical latency was observed in microsomes prepared by gel filtration and in those prepared by high-speed centrifugation. PDI activity was latent in all particulate subcellular fractions, but not latent in the high-speed supernatant. When all fractions were sonicated to expose total PDI activity, PDI was found at highest specific activity in the microsomal fraction and co-distributed with marker enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Washing of microsomes under various conditions that removed peripheral proteins and, in some cases, bound ribosomes did not remove significant quantities of PDI, nor did it affect the latency of PDI activity. Treatment of microsomes with proteinases, under conditions where the permeability barrier of the microsomal vesicles was maintained intact, did not inactivate PDI significantly or affect its latency. PDI was very readily solubilized from microsomal vesicles by low concentrations of detergents, which removed only a fraction of the total microsomal protein. In all these respects, PDI resembled nucleoside diphosphatase, a marker peripheral protein of the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, and differed from NADPH: cytochrome c reductase, a marker integral protein exposed at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The data are compatible with a model in which PDI is loosely associated with the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, a location consistent with the proposed physiological role of the enzyme as catalyst of formation of native disulphide bonds in nascent and newly synthesized secretory proteins.

The molecular cloning of bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) protein (BGP; osteocalcin) was accomplished by constructing a phage lambda gt11 cDNA library from the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2 and screening this library with antibodies raised against BGP from rat bone. By sequencing several cloned cDNAs, we have established a 489-base-pair sequence that predicts a mature BGP of 50 amino acid residues with an NH2-terminal extension of 49 residues. The leader peptide consists of a hydrophobic signal peptide followed by a basic propeptide of 26 or 27 residues that is cleaved after an Arg-Arg dipeptide prior to secretion from the cell. Mature rat BGP is extremely homologous to BGPs from other species except for its COOH-terminal sequence. A stretch of 9 residues proximal to the NH2 terminus of secreted BGP is strikingly similar to the corresponding regions in known propeptides of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing blood coagulation factors. We suggest that this common structural feature may be involved in the posttranslational targeting of these polypeptides for vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation.Images	The propeptide of rat bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein shares homology with other vitamin K-dependent protein precursors.

Matrix Gla protein (MGP), a low molecular weight protein found in bone, dentin, and cartilage, contains 5 residues of the vitamin K-dependent amino acid gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). We have used antibodies raised against MGP and oligonucleotide probes to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from the rat osteosarcoma cells (line ROS 17/2) that had been pretreated with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. By sequencing several cloned cDNAs, we established a 523-base-pair sequence that predicts an 84-residue mature MGP and a 19-residue hydrophobic signal peptide. The 84-residue mature rat MGP predicted from the cDNA sequence has an additional 5 residues at its C terminus (-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Lys) not seen in the sequence of MGP isolated from bovine bone. The structure of rat MGP provides insight into the mechanisms by which the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase recognizes substrate. The present studies show that MGP, unlike other vitamin K-dependent proteins, lacks a propeptide. The absence of an MGP propeptide demonstrates that gamma-carboxylation and secretion of vitamin K-dependent proteins need not be linked to the presence of a propeptide or to its proteolytic removal. The propeptides of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are structurally homologous, and there is evidence that this homologous propeptide domain is important to substrate recognition by the gamma-carboxylase. Mature MGP has a sequence segment (residues 15-30) that is homologous to the propeptide of other vitamin K-dependent proteins and probably serves the same role in gamma-carboxylase recognition. Rat MGP also has a second sequence that has recently been identified in all known vitamin K-dependent vertebrate proteins, the invariant unit Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Glu-Xaa-Cys (EXXXEXC). Since the glutamic residues in this unit are sites of gamma-carboxylation, it has been suggested that the EXXXEXC unit could allow the gamma-carboxylase to discriminate between substrate and product. The demonstration that two structures common to vitamin K-dependent proteins, the homologous propeptides domain and the invariant EXXXEXC unit, are in mature MGP indicates that des-gamma-carboxy-MGP should be an excellent in vitro gamma-carboxylase substrate for analysis of mechanisms involved in substrate recognition and product dissociation.Images	Molecular cloning of matrix Gla protein: implications for substrate recognition by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase.

The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase catalyzes the posttranslational modification of specific glutamic acid residues to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues within the vitamin K-dependent proteins. This enzyme recognizes the gamma-carboxylation recognition site on the propeptide of the precursor forms of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins. To purify this enzyme to homogeneity, the carboxylase from bovine liver microsomes was solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), the protein was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and then the enzyme was isolated by affinity chromatography using a synthetic peptide based upon the structure of the prothrombin propeptide. Elution with 10 mM propeptide yielded a single major band on SDS gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 77,000. In the presence of high concentrations of propeptide, only minimal carboxylase activity was measurable. Antibodies to the protein inhibited the carboxylase activity in crude preparations. In an alternative affinity purification strategy the propeptide was coupled through an NH2-terminal cysteine to an activated thiol-Sepharose column. The carboxylase-propeptide complex was eluted at 25 degrees C by reductive cleavage of the enzyme-propeptide complex in the presence of detergent and phospholipids. The eluted protein (Mr, 77,000) contained both stable vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and vitamin K epoxidase activity. The protein, purified by either method, was detected as a single band (Mr, 77,000) in a Western blot using anti-carboxylase antibodies. A 10,000-fold purification of carboxylase activity from crude microsomes was estimated. Purified bovine liver vitamin K-dependent carboxylase should facilitate the study of its structure and of the mechanism of action of vitamin K as a cofactor in the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme.Images	Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase: affinity purification from bovine liver by using a synthetic propeptide containing the gamma-carboxylation recognition site.

A mutant factor IX, designated factor IXCambridge, was isolated from a patient with hemophilia B. This protein includes an 18-residue propeptide attached to the NH2 terminus of factor IX. A point mutation at residue -1, from an arginine to a serine, precludes cleavage of the propeptide by a processing protease and interferes with gamma-carboxylation of the factor IX, indicating the importance of the leader sequence in substrate recognition by the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. This represents an example of an enzyme defect due to the presence of a point mutation in a precursor protein (preproenzyme) that is the cause of a human hereditary disease. This defect will serve as a prototype for understanding the molecular basis of some forms of hemophilia and other hereditary enzyme deficiencies.Images	Molecular basis of hemophilia B: a defective enzyme due to an unprocessed propeptide is caused by a point mutation in the factor IX precursor.

cDNAs which encode bone gla protein (BGP), an abundant gamma-carboxylated protein of bone, have been cloned from rat and mouse osteosarcoma cell lines. DNA sequence analysis indicates that the cDNAs code for both the 50 (rat) or 46 (mouse) amino acids of the mature proteins and a 49 amino acid leader peptide. The leader peptide of each BGP includes the expected hydrophobic signal sequence and an apparent pro sequence. Although there is no homology between the mature forms of BGP and the gamma-carboxylated clotting factors, we note that there is some homology between their leader peptides. These cDNAs have been used to examine the modulation of BGP mRNA levels by osteoblastic cells in response to hormones. The cDNAs have also allowed isolation of the human BGP gene; analysis of this gene indicates the presence of four exons. Comparison of the exon structure of the BGP gene and the Factor IX (a gamma-carboxylated clotting factor) gene suggests that the exons encoding the part of the leader peptides presumably directing gamma-carboxylation arose from a common ancestral sequence.ImagesFig. 2.

I. Embryonic-chick tendon cells were pulse-labelled for 4 min with [14C]proline and the 14C-labelled polypeptides were chased with unlabelled proline for up to 30 min. Isolation of subcellular fractions during the chase period and their subsequent analysis for bacterial collagenase-susceptible 14C-labelled peptides demonstrated the transfer of procollagen polypeptides from rough to smooth microsomal fractions and thence to the extracellular medium. Parallel analyses of Golgi-enriched fractions indicated the involvement of this organelle in the secretory pathway of procollagen. Sodium dodecylsulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the 14C-labelled polypeptides present in the Golgi-enriched fractions demonstrated that the procollagen polypeptides were all present as disulphide-linked pro-gamma components. 2. When similar kinetic studies of the intracellular transport of procollagen were conducted with embryonic-chick cartilage cells almost identical results were obtained, but the rate of translocation of cartilage procollagen was significantly slower than that observed for tendon procollagen. 3. When hydroxylation of procollagen polypeptides was inhibited by alphaalpha'-bipyridyl, the nascent polypeptides accumulated in the rough microsomal fraction. 4. When cells were pulse-labelled for 4min with [14C)proline and the label was chased in the presence of colchicine, secretion of procollagen was inhibited and an intracellular accumulation of procollagen 14C-labelled polypeptides was observed in the Golgi-enriched fractions. 5. The energy-dependence of the intracellular transport of procollagen was demonstrated in experiments in which antimycin A was found to inhibit the transfer of procollagen polypeptides from rough to smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 6. It is concluded that procollagen follows the classical route of secretion taken by other extracellular proteins.	The route of secretion of procollagen.

1. Methylation analysis of potato (Solanum tuberosum) lectin and thorn-apple (Datura stramonium) lectin confirmed previous conclusions that both glycoproteins contained high proportions of l-arabinofuranosides and lesser amounts of d-galactopyranosides. The arabinofuranosides are present in both lectins as short unbranched chains containing 1→2- and 1→3-linkages, which are known to be linked to hydroxyproline. Galactopyranosides are present as monosaccharides, which are known to be attached to serine, in potato lectin and as both the monosaccharide and the 1→3-linked disaccharide in Datura lectin. 2. Alkaline digestion of potato lectin and subsequent separation of the components by gel filtration led to the isolation of four fractions corresponding to the mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-arabinosides of hydroxyproline. The latter two fractions accounted for over 70% of the total hydroxyproline. 3. Methylation analysis was used to show that the triarabinoside contained only 1→2-linkages between sugars, but that the tetra-arabinoside contained both 1→2- and 1→3-linkages. Direct-insertion mass spectrometry of these compounds using electron impact and chemical ionization, in a comparison with other known structural patterns, was used to determine the sequences of the sugars, which were Araƒ1→2Araƒ1→2Araƒ1→Hyp and Araƒ1→3Araƒ1→2Araƒ1→2Araƒ 1→Hyp. 4. On the basis of optical rotation it had previously been suggested [Allen, Desai, Neuberger & Creeth (1978) Biochem. J. 171, 665–674] that all the arabinose of potato lectin was present as the β-l-furanoside. However, measurement of the optical rotations of the hydroxyprolyl arabinosides showed that whereas the diarabinoside had a molar rotation ([m]) value close to that predicted, the triarabinoside was more dextrorotatory and the tetra-arabinoside was less dextrorotatory than expected. Possible explanations for these findings are that, although the di- and tri-arabinosides contain exclusively β-arabinofuranosides, in the tri-arabinoside, interactions between pentose units lead to an enhanced positive rotation. The tetra-arabinoside, however, is proposed to contain a single α-arabinofuranoside residue, which is responsible for the lower than expected positive rotation. The observed rotation of the tetra-arabinoside was found to be close to the theoretical value predicted on that basis. Furthermore, the action of a specific α-arabinofuranosidase on the tetrasaccharide was to remove a single arabinose residue, presumably the terminal non-reducing sugar, and to produce a product that was indistinguishable on electrophoresis from the triarabinoside. Changes in rotation were compatible with this assumption. 5. It is concluded that the structures of the hydroxyprolyl tri- and tetra-arabinosides of potato lectin are: βAraƒ1→2βAraƒ1→2βAraƒ1→Hyp and αAraƒ1→3βAraƒ1→2βAraƒ 1→2βAraƒ1→Hyp. These are identical with compounds that have been isolated from the insoluble hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins of plant cell walls.

Pea membranes were incubated with UDP-[14C]xylose or UDP-[14C]arabinose and sequentially extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, by vol.) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (2%, w/v). An active epimerase in the membranes rapidly interconverted the two pentosyl nucleotides. Chromatographic analysis of the lipid extract revealed that both substrates gave rise to xylose- and arabinose-containing neutral lipids, xylolipid with properties similar to a polyisoprenol monophosphoryl derivative, and highly charged lipid-linked arabinosyl oligosaccharide. When UDP-[14C]pentose or the extracted lipid-linked [14C]arabinosyl oligosaccharide were used as substrates, their 14C was also incorporating into sodium dodecyl sulphate-soluble and -insoluble fractions as major end products. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of sodium dodecyl sulphate-soluble products indicated the formation of mobile components with Mr values between 40 000 and 200 000 (Sepharose CL-6B). The lipid-linked [14C]arabinosyl oligosaccharide possessed properties comparable with those of unsaturated polyisoprenyl pyrophosphoryl derivatives. It was hydrolysed by dilute acid to a charged product (apparent Mr 2300) that could be fractionated in alkali. It was degraded to shorter labelled oligosaccharides by slightly more concentrated acid and eventually to [14C]arabinose as the only labelled component. Susceptibility to acid hydrolysis, and methylation analysis, indicated that the oligosaccharide contained approximately seven sequential alpha-1,5-linked arabinofuranosyl units at the non-reducing end. Several acidic residues appear to be interposed between the terminal arabinosyl units and the charged lipid.ImagesFig. 3.Fig. 8.	Biosynthesis of pentosyl lipids by pea membranes.

Two types of experiments were carried out; either maize roots were incubated in L-[1-3H]fucose or membranes were prepared from root tips and these were incubated with GDP-L-[U-14C]fucose or UDP-D-[U-4C]glucose. The radioactively labelled lipids that were synthesized in vivo and in vitro were extracted and separated into polar and neutral components. The polar lipids had the characteristics of polyprenyl phosphate and diphosphate fucose or glucose derivatives, and the neutral lipids of sterol glycosides (fucose or glucose). A partial separation of the glycolipid synthetase reactions was achieved. Membranes were fractionated into material that sedimented at 20,000g and 100,000g. Most of the polar glycolipid synthetase activity (for the incorporation of both fucose and glucose) was located in the 100,000 g pellet, and this activity was probably located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The neutral lipid, which contained fucose, was synthesized mainly by membranes of the 20,000g pellet, and the activity was probably associated with the dictyosomes, whereas the neutral glucolipids were synthesized by all the membrane fractions. It is suggested that the polar (polyprenyl) lipids labelled with fucose could act as possible intermediates during the synthesis of the glycoproteins and slime in the root tip.

The 2- to 4-fold rise in particle-bound β-glucan synthetase (uridine diphosphate-glucose: β-1, 4-glucan glucosyltransferase) activity that can be induced by indoleacetic acid in pea stem tissue is not prevented by concentrations of actinomycin D or cycloheximide that inhibit growth and macromolecule synthesis. The rise is concluded to be a hormonally induced activation of previously existing, reversibly deactivated enzyme. The activation is not a direct allosteric effect of indoleacetic acid or sugars. It is blocked by inhibitors of energy metabolism, by 2-deoxyglucose, and by high osmolarity, but not by Ca2+ at concentrations that inhibit auxin-induced elongation and prevent promotion of sugar uptake by indoleacetic acid, and not by α, α′-dipyridyl at concentrations that inhibit formation of hydroxyproline. Regulation of the system could be due either to an ATP-dependent activating reaction affecting this enzyme, or to changes in levels of a primer or a lipid cofactor.

Treatment of pea stem segments with indoleacetic acid (IAA) causes within 1 hour a 2- to 4-fold increase in activity of particulate uridine diphosphoglucose-dependent β-glucan synthetase obtainable from the tissue. The IAA effect is observable in tissue from all parts of the elongation zone of the pea stem, and also in older tissue that is not capable of a cell enlargement response to IAA. A large increase in activity is caused by IAA only if synthetase activity in the isolated tissue has first been allowed to fall substantially below the intact plant level, and only if sucrose is supplied along with IAA. Treatment of tissue with sucrose alone after a period of sugar starvation causes a transient rise of synthetase activity. The decline in synthetase activity in absence of IAA, the rise caused by IAA, and the transient rise caused by sucrose are all strongly temperature-dependent. IAA and sucrose do not affect the activity of isolated synthetase particles. Synthetase activity in vivo is sensitive to as low as 0.1 μm IAA and is increased by IAA analogues that are active as auxins on elongation but not by nonauxin analogues. Activity begins to rise 10 to 15 minutes after exposure to IAA, which places this among the most rapid enzyme effects of a plant growth regulator heretofore demonstrated, and among the most rapid known metabolic effects of auxins. The effect is seen also with polysaccharide synthetase activity using uridine diphosphate-galactose or uridine diphosphate-xylose as substrates, and to a lesser extent with guanosine diphosphoglucose-dependent glucan synthetase activity. Glucan synthetase from IAA-treated tissue appears to have a higher affinity for uridine diphosphate-glucose than the control.	Regulation of β-Glucan Synthetase Activity by Auxin in Pea Stem TissueI.

In the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, 2-oxoglutarate, Fe2+ and a reducing agent, cell-free extracts of Streptomyces clavuligerus convert cephalosporin C and O-carbamoyldeacetylcephalosporin C into 7 alpha-methoxy derivatives. No synthesis of a 7 alpha-methoxy derivative of deacetylcephalosporin C was detected in the system used, and the 7 alpha-methoxy derivative of deacetoxycephalosporin C was produced only in relatively small amounts. It appears that the 7 alpha-methoxy group is introduced after the cephalosporin ring system has been formed and that its introduction may represent the final step in a biosynthetic pathway.

The biosynthesis of isopenicillin N from delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine in a cell-free system has been correlated wih O2 consumption by two methods, involving the use of an oxygen-electrode and an n.m.r. spectrometer respectively. The results are consistent with a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio for the dioxygen consumed to the isopenicillin N formed.

Cell-free extracts of antibiotic-negative mutants of Cephalosporium acremonium converted delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (LLD-tripeptide) into an antibiotic that was destroyed by penicillinase. The enzymic activity of the extracts was destroyed by boiling, but was not inhibited by cycloheximide. LLL-Tripeptide was totally inactive as substrate. The product resembled isopenicillin N, but not penicillin N, in its antibacterial spectrum. We propose that isopenicillin N is the first product of cyclization of LLD-tripeptide.

Homocitrate synthase in the first enzyme of the lysine biosynthetic pathway. It is feedback regulated by L-lysine. Lysine decreases the biosynthesis of penicillin (determined by the incorporation of [14C]valine into penicillin) by inhibiting and repressing homocitrate synthase, thereby depriving the cell of alpha-aminoadipic acid, a precursor of penicillin. Lysine feedback inhibited in vivo the biosynthesis and excretion of homocitrate by a lysine auxotroph, L2, blocked in the lysine pathway after homocitrate. Neither penicillin nor 6-aminopenicillanic acid exerted any effect at the homocitrate synthase level. The molecular mechanism of lysine feedback regulation in Penicillium chrysogenum involved both inhibition of homocitrate synthase activity and repression of its synthesis. In vitro studies indicated that L-lysine feedback inhibits and represses homocitrate synthase both in low- and high-penicillin-producing strains. Inhibition of homocitrate synthase activity by lysine was observed in cells in which protein synthesis was arrested with cycloheximide. Maximum homocitrate synthase activity in cultures of P. chrysogenum AS-P-78 was found at 48 h, coinciding with the phase of high rate of penicillin biosynthesis.

Cell-free cyclization of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine to isopenicillin N by lytic enzyme extracts of Cephalosporium acremonium M-0198 was stimulated by ferrous ions. The optimum concentration of FeSO4 was 80 microM. No additional stimulation was observed with ascorbate, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, or alpha-ketoglutarate, but Triton X-100 and sonication of the extracts increased activity. ZnSO4 was very inhibitory to enzyme activity; CuSO4 was somewhat less inhibitory, and the least effective of the three was MnCl2. The dimer of the tripeptide was converted to a penicillin that has the biological spectrum of isopenicillin N, and this reaction was also stimulated by FeSO4. We found that sonication can be used directly to prepare extracts with cyclization activity from mycelia, without preparing protoplast lysates. The kinetics of cyclase appearance and disappearance during fermentation were similar to those of ring-expansion activity, i.e., enzyme appeared and peaked 13 h after growth ceased and then disappeared.

"Methodology which allows consistent shotgun cloning of streptomycete genes is presented. Parameters that increase transformation efficiency of Streptomyces lividans 66 were adjusted to generate reproducibly a population of cloned genes likely to represent the entire genome. Factors which influence the recovery of viable transformants include: growth phase of the mycelium, ionic and osmotic characteristics of the medium during protoplast formation and transformation, and moisture content and protoplast density during regeneration. A modified transformation procedure was devised which increased transformation frequency more than 20-fold (allowing up to 10(7) primary transformants per microgram of SLP1.2 covalently closed circular DNA) and greatly facilitated the cloning of drug resistance genes and biosynthetic genes, using one of two plasmid vectors. Viomycin resistance genes on BamHI or PstI fragments were cloned from S. vinaceus genomic DNA into S. lividans, using the SLP1.2 vector. At least three different S. vinaceus BamHI fragments (1.9, 5.8, or 8.5 kilobases) confer viomycin resistance; only one PstI fragment (4.3 kilobases) was found. Recombinant plasmids were all able to produce lethal zygosis and to be transferred by conjugation within S. lividans. SCP2 was used to clone S. coelicolor A3(2) genes that ""complemented"" the auxotrophic mutation hisD3, argA1, or guaA1. Recombinant DNA technology can now be applied to economically and academically interesting problems unique to streptomycete molecular biology.Images"	Cloning of antibiotic resistance and nutritional genes in streptomycetes.

Determinants of antibiotic resistance have been cloned from four antibiotic-producing streptomycetes into Streptomyces lividans. Biochemical analyses of resistant clones revealed the presence of enzymes that had previously been characterized as likely resistance determinants in the producing organisms. These included: 23S rRNA methylases from S. azureus and S. erythreus, which confer resistance to thiostrepton and erythromycin, respectively; viomycin phosphotransferase from S. vinaceus; and aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and acetyltransferase from the neomycin producer S. fradiae. In general, the levels of antibiotic resistance of the clones were similar to those of the producing organisms. Although the two aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes from S. fradiae could independently confer only low-level resistance to neomycin, the presence of both enzymes in the same strain resulted in a level of resistance comparable with that of the producing organism.

A procedure for efficient transformation of Streptomyces ambofaciens and Streptomyces fradiae protoplasts with plasmid DNA was developed. Transformation frequencies with S. fradiae protoplasts were strongly influenced by the temperatures for cell growth, protoplast formation, and protoplast regeneration. Transformation frequencies for both species were also influenced by the culture age before protoplast formation, the source and concentration of polyethylene glycol, the transformation-inducing agent, the concentration of protoplasts used in the transformation procedure, and the number of protoplasts added to regeneration plates. Transformation frequencies were substantially higher for both species when calf thymus DNA and protamine sulfate were added to the transformation mix. With S. fradiae, transformation frequencies were much lower with plasmid DNA prepared from other species than with the same plasmids prepared from S. fradiae, suggesting that S. fradiae expresses restriction and modification. With the modified transformation procedures using DNA prepared from homologous hosts, S. ambofaciens and S. fradiae are now transformed routinely at frequencies of 10(6) to 10(7) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA.

An str gene cluster containing at least four genes (strR, strA, strB, and strC) involved in streptomycin biosynthesis or streptomycin resistance or both was self-cloned in Streptomyces griseus by using plasmid pOA154. The strA gene was verified to encode streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase, a streptomycin resistance factor in S. griseus, by examining the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli. The other three genes were determined by complementation tests with streptomycin-nonproducing mutants whose biochemical lesions were clearly identified. strR complemented streptomycin-sensitive mutant SM196 which exhibited impaired activity of both streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase and amidinotransferase (one of the streptomycin biosynthetic enzymes) due to a regulatory mutation; strB complemented strain SD141, which was specifically deficient in amidinotransferase; and strC complemented strain SD245, which was deficient in linkage between streptidine 6-phosphate and dihydrostreptose. By deletion analysis of plasmids with appropriate restriction endonucleases, the order of the four genes was determined to be strR-strA-strB-strC. Transformation of S. griseus with plasmids carrying both strR and strB genes enhanced amidinotransferase activity in the transformed cells. Based on the gene dosage effect and the biological characteristics of the mutants complemented by strR and strB, it was concluded that strB encodes amidinotransferase and strR encodes a positive effector required for the full expression of strA and strB genes. Furthermore, it was found that amplification of a specific 0.7-kilobase region of the cloned DNA on a plasmid inhibited streptomycin biosynthesis of the transformants. This DNA region might contain a regulatory apparatus that participates in the control of streptomycin biosynthesis.Images	Self-cloning in Streptomyces griseus of an str gene cluster for streptomycin biosynthesis and streptomycin resistance.

1. delta-(L-alpha-Amino[4,5-3H]adipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-[4,4-3H]valine has been synthesized from its constituent amino acids, the L-alpha-amino[4,5-3H]adipic acid being obtained by reduction with 3H2 of methyl 5-acetamido-5,5-diethoxycarbonylpent-2-enoate and subsequent decarboxylation and hydrolysis. 2. In a cell-free system prepared by lysis of protoplasts of Cephalosporium acremonium 3H was incorporated from the doubly labelled tripeptide into a compound that behaved like penicillin N or isopenicillin N. The relative specific radioactivities of the alpha-aminoadipyl and penicillamine moieties of the penicillin were the same (within experimental error) as those of the alpha-aminoadipic acid and valine residues respectively of the tripeptide. 3. The behaviour of the labelled alpha-aminoadipic acid from the penicillin to the L-amino acid oxidase of Crotalus adamanteus venom showed that it was mainly L-alpha-aminoadipic acid. 4. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the carbon skeleton of the LLD-tripeptide is incorporated intact into the penicillin molecule and that the first product is isopenicillin N.

1. In a cell-free system prepared by lysis of protoplasts of Cephalosporium acremonium mutant M-0198, 3H and 14C were incorporated from singly- and doubly-labelled penicillin N into deacetoxycephalosporin C. 2. The deacetoxcephalosporin C obtained from the above feeding experiments was converted into two different crystalline derivatives, namely N-phthalimidodeacetoxycephalosporin C bisbenzhydryl ester and N-phthalimidodeacetoxycephalosporin C bisdicyclohexylamine salt and recrystallized to constant specific activity or constant ratio of specific activity. 3. That 3H is incorporated at C-7 in the biosynthesized deacetoxycephalosporin C was shown by the loss of radioactivity (95.2%) after methoxylating the derived N-phthalimidodeacetoxycephalosporin C bisbenzyhydryl ester. 4. Deacetoxycephalosporin C was also the product of the cell-free reaction conducted in the presence of ferrous ions and ascorbic acid, as shown by two-dimensional paper electrophoresis-chromatography; these additives appreciably improved the efficiency of conversion.

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is synthesized in mammalian cells as a mixture of two forms that differ in their extent of N-linked glycosylation. We have investigated the mechanism underlying this variation in glycosylation, using a cell-free system that consists of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate optimized for the formation of disulphide bonds and supplemented with dog pancreas microsomal membranes. Molecules of human t-PA synthesized in vitro are enzymically active and responsive to natural activators and inhibitors, and are glycosylated in a pattern identical with that of the protein produced in vivo. This demonstrates that t-PA synthesized in vitro folds into the same conformation as the protein synthesized in vivo. We show that the extent of glycosylation of individual t-PA molecules is dependent on the state of folding of the polypeptide chain, since the probability of addition of an oligosaccharide side chain at Asn-184 is decreased under conditions that promote the formation of enzymically active molecules. This variation in glycosylation is independent of the rate of protein synthesis.ImagesFig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.	Cell-free synthesis of enzymically active tissue-type plasminogen activator.

1. The oxidant, tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBuOOH) depolarizes calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells by activating a non-selective cation channel. To identify the molecular mediator of channel activation during oxidant stress, the patch-clamp technique was used to compare tBuOOH-induced changes in membrane potential and channel activity with those induced by oxidized glutathione (GSSG), a cytosolic product of oxidant metabolism. 2. When recording pipettes contained GSSG (2 mM), whole-cell zero-current potential measured immediately following pipette break-in was not different from control values (-57 mV). However, within 20 min of break-in, zero-current potential was depolarized to -7 mV. The time course of depolarization was dependent on the concentration of GSSG and was accelerated by inhibition of GSSG metabolism. 3. In excised membrane patches, channels were activated by internal GSSG, but not by internal tBuOOH, reduced glutathione (GSH), or external GSSG. Channels were equal in size (28 pS) and in ionic selectivity to those activated by incubation of intact cells with tBuOOH. As little as 20 microM GSSG was sufficient to maximally activate channels. However, the time course of channel activation was concentration dependent between 20 microM and 2 mM GSSG. 4. Channel activation by GSSG was reversed by GSH and by increasing the [GSH]:[GSSG] ratio. Likewise, channel activation by pre-incubation of intact cells with tBuOOH was reversed by GSH applied after patch excision. 5. These results strongly suggest that GSSG is an endogenous intracellular mediator of channel activation and depolarization during oxidant stress.

Imipramine inhibits the serotonin uptake by binding with high affinity to regulatory sites of this uptake located on axons that release serotonin. The number of imipramine recognition sites located on crude synaptic membrane preparations is reduced by two daily injections of imipramine or desmethylimipramine for 3 weeks. When the binding sites for [3H]imipramine are down-regulated the Vmax of the neuronal uptake of serotonin is increased. Moreover, in minces prepared from the brain hippocampus of rats receiving imipramine in a dose regimen that reduces the number of [3H]imipramine recognition sites, the efficiency of imipramine as a blocker of the serotonin uptake is diminished. Hence the high-affinity binding sites for [3H]imipramine may have a physiological role in modulation of serotonin reuptake. Probably this is mediated by an endogenous effector of these regulatory sites. A nonpeptidic constituent of rat brain capable of displacing [3H]imipramine from its high-affinity binding site and of inhibiting the serotonin uptake in a dose-related manner has been extracted and its partial purification is described.Images	Modulation of neuronal serotonin uptake by a putative endogenous ligand of imipramine recognition sites.

The effects of GSSG on Ca2+ mobilization by Ins(1,4,5)P3 were studied in permeabilized rat hepatocytes. Incubation with GSSG (2 mM) increased the sensitivity to Ins(1,4,5)P3 for Ca2+ release, with no effect on the size of the Ca2+ pool that could be released with maximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3. GSSG decreased the EC50 for Ins(1,4,5)P3 from a control value of 578 +/- 23 nM to 137 +/- 21 nM. GSSG had no effect on the metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in permeabilized cells, and sensitization of Ca2+ release was still observed when the poorly metabolizable analogue inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphorothioate was used. GSSG did not affect the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump or the extent of loading of intracellular Ca2+ pools. In addition, the enhancement of Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitivity by GSSG occurred under conditions where the Ca2+ pumps were blocked with thapsigargin or by chelation of medium Ca2+ just before Ins(1,4,5)P3 addition. The effect of GSSG was time- and dose-dependent, maximal effects being observed after 5 min incubation with 2 mM-GSSG. Cystine mimicked the GSSG-induced increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitivity, and the effects could be reversed by dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT, GSH glutathione and cysteine had no effect when added alone. Other agents known to react with protein thiols, including N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and Ag+, did not affect the sensitivity to Ins(1,4,5)P3, but were inhibitors of ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. The data suggest that the sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+ pools to release by Ins(1,4,5)P3 can be modulated by the formation of mixed disulphides with GSSG or other oxidized thiols.

1. By analogy with studies on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles, Ca2+ release induced by heavy metals and mercaptans (e.g. cysteine) was investigated in rabbit skinned psoas fibres through measurements of isometric tension. 2. Heavy metals (at 2-5 microM) elicited phasic contractions by triggering Ca2+ release from the SR and had the following order of potency: Hg2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Ag+ > Ni2+. Higher concentrations produced tonic contractions due to maintained high Ca2+ permeability of SR membranes. 3. Contractions induced by heavy metals required a functional and Ca(2+)-loaded SR, were dependent on [Ca2+]free, blocked by Ruthenium Red (RR), inhibited by free Mg2+ and reduced glutathione (GSH) but not by oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Such contractions were not elicited through direct interaction(s) of heavy metals with the myofilaments. 4. In the presence of catalytic concentrations of Hg2+ or Cu2+ (2-5 microM), additions of cysteine (25-100 microM) elicited rapid twitches, producing 70% of maximal force with a time to half-peak of 2 s. Contractions induced by cysteine plus a catalyst required a functional SR network, were dependent on free [Mg2+] and were blocked by RR or GSH but not by GSSG. 5. In the presence of Hg2+ (2-5 microM), low concentrations of cysteine (10 microM) elicited tonic contractures, but subsequent or higher additions of cysteine (50-100 microM) caused further SR Ca2+ release and tension, followed by rapid and full relaxation. 6. High cysteine (200-250 microM, without Cu2+ or Hg2+) blocked contractions elicited by Cl- induced depolarization of sealed T-tubules. High cysteine probably acted as a sulphydryl reducing agent which promoted rapid relaxation of the fibres through the closure of Ca(2+)-release channels and ATP-dependent re-uptake of Ca2+ by the SR. 7. In some batches of skinned fibres (approximately 10%), cysteine (5-50 microM) alone (without Hg2+ or Cu2+ catalyst) produced rapid twitches. This implied that the catalyst(s) necessary to promote the sulphydryl oxidation reaction with exogenously added cysteine may be present in intact fibres but is usually lost by the skinning procedure. 8. The data demonstrate that skeletal fibres contain a highly reactive and accessible sulphydryl site on an SR protein which can be reversibly oxidized and reduced to respectively, open and close SR Ca(2+)-release channels. A model of sulphydryl-gated excitation-contraction coupling is proposed where the voltage sensor on the T-tubule membrane directly oxidizes sulphydryl sites on SR Ca(2+)-release channels.	Sulphydryl reagents trigger Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skinned rabbit psoas fibres.	G Salama, J J Abramson, G K Pike	1335505	1992-08-01	10	
Oxidant stress induced by t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) inhibits bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ signalling in vascular endothelial cells. The effect of t-BuOOH on intracellular Ca2+ pools was determined by addition of Ca(2+)-releasing agents to fura-2-loaded cells suspended in Ca(2+)-free/EGTA buffer. In control cells, sequential additions of bradykinin and ionomycin produced similar increases in cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). By contrast, incubation with t-BuOOH progressively decreased the response of [Ca2+]i to bradykinin and increased that to ionomycin, suggesting that the total (ionomycin-releasable) Ca2+ pool remains replete during oxidant stress. The effect of t-BuOOH on the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool was measured by the increase in [Ca2+]i or efflux of 45Ca2+ stimulated by 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone (BHQ). Incubation with t-BuOOH did not inhibit BHQ-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i or 45Ca2+ efflux, suggesting that the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool remains replete and releasable. Activity of the Ca(2+)-influx pathway stimulated by release of internal Ca2+ stores was determined via re-addition of Ca2+ to BHQ-stimulated cells suspended in Ca(2+)-free/EGTA buffer and via BHQ-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake. Incubation of cells with t-BuOOH for 1 h significantly inhibited the influx pathway. At later time points, t-BuOOH increased basal [Ca2+]i and potentiated the response of [Ca2+]i to BHQ. Similar results were demonstrated with thapsigargin. Together, these findings suggest that (1) the inhibitory effect of t-BuOOH on bradykinin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from internal stores is not related to depletion of these stores, and (2) inhibition of the store-dependent Ca(2+)-influx pathway occurs by a direct effect of the influx pathway or by inhibition of the mechanism which links the internal Ca2+ store to plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx.	Oxidant stress inhibits the store-dependent Ca(2+)-influx pathway of vascular endothelial cells.	S J Elliott, T N Doan	8503874	1993-06-01	10	
1. The properties of sulfhydryl redox modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor have been examined in rat cortical neurones in culture. Electrophysiological measurements were performed with the whole-cell and outside-out patch variants of the patch-clamp technique. 2. The disulphide reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT; 0.1-10 mM) potentiated 10 microM NMDA-mediated whole-cell currents when applied slowly alone via the superfusate. The initial rate of reduction, as well as the degree of potentiation, was dependent on the concentration of DTT although the process was complicated by the fact that a second, large component appeared at a concentration of 10 mM of this agent. 3. DTT (0.1-10 mM) was also rapidly applied together with the agonist from a perfusion pipette. With this method, the second component was not readily apparent, and the concentration of DTT producing a half-maximal potentiation of the NMDA response was 1.9 +/- 0.3 mM. Two other disulphide reducing agents, ethylene glycol bisthioglycolate and meso-bis(N,N-dimethyl)adipamide-2,5-dithiol, also potentiated NMDA responses, but were not as effective as DTT. 4. Following a 4 mM DTT treatment, we observed that the NMDA receptor underwent spontaneous oxidation with a half-time of 1.9 min. In contrast, the sulfhydryl oxidizing agent 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitro-benzoic acid) (DTNB; 500 microM) produced a more rapid reversal of the effects of DTT (t1/2 = 0.6 min). The spontaneously oxidized receptor could be further oxidized with DTNB and fully reduced with DTT. 5. After receptor oxidation with 500 microM DTNB, NMDA produced whole-cell responses with an EC50 of 68.4 +/- 9.4 microM, whereas after reduction with 4 mM DTT the EC50 for NMDA was 32.5 +/- 3.4 microM. In addition, the maximum response after reduction with DTT was substantially increased over that observed after oxidation. 6. Single channel measurements performed on outside-out patches revealed that reduction produced a dramatic increase in the number of NMDA-induced channel openings. We observed a 2.1 +/- 0.2-fold increase in the frequency of openings during reduction with 500 microM DTT when compared to patches which had been exposed to 500 microM DTNB. Small but significant differences were observed in the single channel conductance for the oxidized (34.6 +/- 1.1 pS) and reduced (37.6 +/- 1.5 pS) states of the receptor. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in the arithmetic mean channel open time between the two redox conditions (5.4 +/- 0.3 ms after oxidation, 6.0 +/- 0.7 ms after reduction).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	The modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by redox and alkylating reagents in rat cortical neurones in vitro.

The model oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-buOOH), inhibits Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent Ca2+ signalling in calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Metabolism of t-buOOH within the cytosol is coupled to the oxidation of glutathione. In this study, we investigated whether oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is the intracellular moiety responsible for mediating the effects of t-buOOH on Ca2+ signalling. The increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] stimulated by application of 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) was used to estimate the luminal Ca2+ content of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store in intact cells. Luminal Ca2+ content was unaffected by t-buOOH (0.4 mM, 0-3 h) unless intracellular GSSG content was concomitantly elevated. The effect was specific for increased GSSG and was not replicated by depletion of GSH. These results suggest that cytosolic GSSG, produced endogenously within the endothelial cell, decreases the luminal Ca2+ content of Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Depletion of internal Ca2+ stores by GSSG may represent a key mechanism by which some forms of oxidant stress inhibit signal transduction in vascular tissue. At the plasma membrane, t-buOOH is known to inhibit the capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway. Increased intracellular GSSG potentiated the inhibitory effect of t-buOOH on Ca2+ influx, thereby providing the first evidence that activity of the capacitative Ca2+ influx channel is sensitive to thiol reagents formed endogenously within the cell.

"Neuronal uptake recognition sites in norepinephrine neurons have been labeled with the antidepressant [3H]desipramine. A high-affinity component of [3H]desipramine binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes is abolished selectively by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, which destroy central catecholamine neurons. The high-affinity [3H]desipramine binding has a nanomolar affinity constant for desipramine and is inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants with potencies that correlate with their ability to inhibit the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine. [3H]Desipramine binding to the uptake sites is markedly stimulated by sodium, with potassium, lithium, and choline being much less effective. The ability to monitor norepinephrine neuronal uptake ""receptors"" in simple binding studies should permit a differential analysis of drug influences on the norepinephrine recognition site and the translocation mechanism. The regulation of [3H]desipramine binding by sodium may help clarify how sodium influences neurotransmitter uptake."

1. [14C]Acetylcholine synthesis and 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose has been measured in tissue prism preparations from human neocortex. 2. Electron micrographs of prisms from human and rat neocortex show that both contain intact synaptic endings with evenly-distributed vesicles and normal-appearing mitochondria, but only poorly preserved cell body structure. 3. Synthesis of [14C]acetylcholine in prisms from rat neocortex is similar to estimates for turnover in vivo. Synthesis in prisms from human neocortex is 18% of that in rat tissue and 64% of that in tissue from baboon neocortex for incubations performed in 31 mM-K+. 4. Investigations of prisms prepared from rat brains stored at 37 degrees C after death revealed that synthesis of [14C]acetylcholine in the presence of 31 mM-K+ was greatly decreased within 30 min of post-mortem incubation, whereas synthesis at 5 mM-K+ and production of 14CO2 at both K+ concentrations were only significantly affected after longer periods. Changes were similar in neocortex and striatum. Thus human autopsy material is unlikely to be suitable for use with this system. 5. Investigations using animal models suggest that [14C]acetylcholine synthesis and 14CO2 production are not affected by surgical or anaesthetic procedures. 6. Neither [14C]acetylcholine synthesis nor 14CO2 production in human prisms was significantly changed with age between 15 and 68 years. 7. Samples from patients with the dementing condition Alzheimer's disease showed a significant decrease in [14C]acetylcholine synthesis to 47% of normal samples and a significant increase of 39% in production of 14CO2.ImagesPLATE 1 (cont.)PLATE 1	[14C]acetylcholine synthesis and [14C]carbon dioxide production from [U-14C]glucose by tissue prisms from human neocortex.

Binding sites with high affinity and specificity for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) are present in homogenates of rat brain. The characteristics of the binding sites resemble those of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Specific binding is saturable with respect to [3H]QNB and tissue concentration and is time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent. The bimolecular rate of association (2.0 × 108 M-1 min-1) and dissociation (1.2 × 10-2 min-1) at 35° indicate a dissociation constant of 60 pM and a density of 65 pmol/g of brain. Muscarinic antagonists and agonists displace specific [3H]QNB binding, while nicotinic and non-cholinergic drugs possess little affinity for [3H]QNB-binding sites.

1. The methods for the assay of choline acetyltransferase were based on the reaction between labelled acetyl-CoA and unlabelled choline to give labelled acetylcholine. 2. Both synthetic acetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA formed from sodium [1-14C]acetate or sodium [3H]acetate by incubation with CoA, ATP, Mg2+ and extract from acetone-dried pigeon liver were used. 3. [1-14C]Acetylcholine was isolated by extraction with ketonic sodium tetraphenylboron. 4. [3H]Acetylcholine was precipitated with sodium tetraphenylboron to remove a ketone-soluble contaminant in sodium [3H]acetate and then extracted with ketonic sodium tetraphenylboron. 5. The values of choline acetyltransferase activity obtained in the presence of sodium cyanide or EDTA and synthetic acetyl-CoA were similar to those obtained with acetyl-CoA synthesized in situ. 6. The assay of acetylcholinesterase was based on the formation of labelled acetate from labelled acetylcholine. The labelled acetylcholine could be quantitatively removed from the acetate by extraction with ketonic sodium tetraphenylboron. 7. The methods were tested with samples from central and peripheral nervous tissues and purified enzymes. 8. The blank values for choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase corresponded to the activities in 20ng. and 5ng. of brain tissue respectively.

The enhanced reduction of t-butyl hydroperoxide by glutathione peroxidase is accompanied by a decrease in the cellular concentration of both glutathione and NADPH in isolated liver cells, resulting in the release of GSSG (oxidized glutathione) from the perfused rat liver. This phenomenon, first reported by H. Sies, C. Gerstenecker, H. Menzel & L. Flohé (1972) (FEBS Lett. 27, 171-175), can be observed under a variety of conditions, not only with the acceleration of the glutathione peroxidase reaction by organic peroxides, but also during the oxidation of glycollate and benzylamine, during demethylation of aminopyrine in the liver of the phenobarbital-pretreated rat and during oxidation of uric acid in the liver of the starved rat pretreated with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The rate of release of GSSG is altered markedly by changes in the metabolic conditions which affect the rate of hepatic NADPH generation. Thus, regardless of whether achieved by enhanced oxidation of glutathione by glutathione peroxidase or by oxidation of NADPH through other metabolic pathways, an increase in the cellular concentration of GSSG appears to facilitate its release. It has been found that, in addition to the hexose monophosphate shunt, the mitochondrial NADH-NADP+ transhydrogenase reaction plays an important role in supplying reducing equivalents to the glutathione peroxidase reaction and in maintaining the cellular oxidation-reduction state of the nicotinamide nucleotides. Spectrophotometric analysis of the steady-state concentration of the catalase-H2O2 intermediate with simultaneous measurement of the rate of release of GSSG leads to the conclusion that intracellular compartmentation of catalase in the peroxisomes and glutathione peroxidase in the cytosol and mitochondria distinguishes the reactivities of these enzymes one from the other, and facilitates their effective cooperation in hydroperoxide metabolism in the liver.

Smooth muscle derived from the inner media and intima of immature guinea pig aorta were grown for up to 8 wk in cell culture. The cells maintained the morphology of smooth muscle at all phases of their growth in culture. After growing to confluency, they grew in multiple overlapping layers. By 4 wk in culture, microfibrils (110 A) appeared within the spaces between the layers of cells. Basement membrane-like material also appeared adjacent to the cells. Analysis of the microfibrils showed that they have an amino acid composition similar to that of the microfibrillar protein of the intact elastic fiber. These investigations coupled with the radioautographic observations of the ability of aortic smooth muscle to synthesize and secrete extracellular proteins demonstrate that this cell is a connective tissue synthetic cell.

Cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which lack functional low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, fail to bind, take up, or degrade the lipoprotein with high affinity; therefore LDL-cholesterol is not made available for suppression of cholesterol synthesis or activation of cholesteryl ester formation. When LDL was given a positive charge by reaction with N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine (cationized LDL), the rate of degradation of the lipoprotein was increased by more than 100-fold in the homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia fibroblasts. Degradation of cationized LDL was inhibited by chloroquine, suggesting that it occurred in cellular lysosomes. Although the cationized LDL entered the cell through a mechanism independent of the LDL receptor, the cholesterol liberated from the degradation of the lipoprotein became available for suppression of cholesterol synthesis and stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation in the homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia fibroblasts. The rate of degradation of albumin by fibroblasts was also increased by more than 100-fold when this protein was coupled to N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine. The ability to deliver a protein to lysosomes by giving it a strong positive charge may have potential relevance not only to familial hypercholesterolemia, but also to inborn errors of metabolism that involve deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes.Images	Degradation of cationized low density lipoprotein and regulation of cholesterol metabolism in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia fibroblasts.

Cultured endothelial cells provide a model for the study of interactions of vasoactive peptides with endothelium. Endothelial cell cultured from veins of human umbilical cords contain both angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) and angiotensinase activities. Intact monolayers of cells can both activate angiotensin I and inactivate bradykinin when the peptides are added to culture flasks in protein-free medium. Intact suspended cells or lysed cells convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, inactivate bradykinin, and hydrolyze hippuryldiglycine to hippuric acid and diglycine. These actions are inhibited by SQ 20881, the specific inhibitor of converting enzyme. The kininase activity of endothelial cells was partially inhibited by antibody to human lung converting enzyme. Endothelial cells also inactivate longer analogs of bradykinin, such as kallidin, methionyl-lysyl bradykinin, and bradykinin coupled covalently to 500,000 mol wt dextran. The endothelial cells retained converting enzyme activity through four successive subcultures, indicating that the enzyme is synthesized by the cells surface, and it is apparently a marker for endothelial cells, since cultured human fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and baby hamster kidney cells do not have it. Endothelial cells also contain an aminopheptidase which hydrolyzes both angiotensin II and the synthetic substrate, alpha-L-aspartyl beta-naphthylamide. The angiotensinase activity increased when the cells were lysed, which suggests that the enzyme is localized within the cells, Hydrolysis of both alpha-L-aspartyl beta-naphthylamide and angiotensin II was inhibited by omicron-phenanthroline, indicating that the enzyme is an A-tipe anigotensinase.Images	Metabolism of vasoactive peptides by human endothelial cells in culture.

Resident mouse peritoneal macrophages were shown to take up and degrade acetylated 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (125I-acetyl-LDL) in vitro at rates that were 20-fold greater than those for the uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL. The uptake of 125I-acetyl-LDL and its subsequent degradation in lysosomes were attributable to a high-affinity, trypsin-sensitive, surface binding site that recognized acetyl-LDL but not native LDL. When 125I-acetyl-LDL was bound to this site at 4°C and the macrophages were subsequently warmed to 37°C, 75% of the cell-bound radioactivity was degraded to mono[125I]iodotyrosine within 1 hr. The macrophage binding site also recognized maleylated LDL, maleylated albumin, and two sulfated polysaccharides (fucoidin and dextran sulfate) indicating that negative charges were important in the binding reaction. A similar binding site was present on rat peritoneal macrophages, guinea pig Kupffer cells, and cultured human monocytes but not on human lymphocytes or fibroblasts, mouse L cells or Y-1 adrenal cells, or Chinese hamster ovary cells. Uptake and degradation of acetyl-LDL via this binding site stimulated cholesterol esterification 100-fold and produced a 38-fold increase in the cellular content of cholesterol in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Although the physiologic significance, if any, of this macrophage uptake mechanism is not yet known, we hypothesize that it may mediate the degradation of denatured LDL in the body and thus serve as a “backup” mechanism for the previously described receptor-mediated degradation of native LDL that occurs in parenchymal cells. Such a scavenger pathway might account for the widespread deposition of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters in macrophages of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia in whom the parenchymal cell pathway for LDL degradation is blocked, owing to a genetic deficiency of receptors for native LDL.

Chemical modification of lysine residues by acetoacetylation of the apoproteins of iodinated canine and human low density lipoproteins (LDL) and canine high density lipoproteins (HDL) resulted in a marked acceleration in the rate of removal of these lipoproteins from the plasma after intravenous injection into dogs. Clearance of the lipoproteins from the plasma correlated with their rapid appearance in the liver. Acetoacetylated canine 125I-LDL (30-60% of the lysine residues modified) were essentially completely removed from the plasma within an hour, and > 75% of the activity cleared within 5 min. Reversal of the acetoacetylation of the lysine residues of the LDL restored to these lipoproteins a rate of clearance essentially identical to that of control LDL. Identical results were obtained with modified human LDL injected into dogs. At 10 min, when ≅ 90% of the acetoacetylated human 125I-LDL had been removed from the plasma, 90% of the total injected activity could be accounted for in the liver. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate an enhancement in uptake and degradation of acetoacetylated LDL by canine peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The mechanism(s) responsible for the enhanced removal of the LDL and HDL in vivo and in vitro remains to be determined. By contrast, however, acetoacetylation of canine 125I-apoE HDLc did not accelerate their rate of removal from the plasma but, in fact, retarded their clearance. Control (native) apoE HDLc were removed from the plasma (64% within 20 min) and rapidly appeared in the liver (39% at 20 min). At the same time point, only 45% of the acetoacetylated apoE HDLc were cleared from the plasma and <10% appeared in the liver. Acetoacetylation of the apoE HDLc did not enhance their uptake or degradation by macrophages. The rapid clearance from the plasma of the native apoE HDLc in normal and hypercholesterolemic dogs suggests that the liver may be a normal site for the removal of the cholesteryl ester-rich apoE HDLc. The retardation in removal after acetoacetylation of apoE HDLc indicates that the uptake process may be mediated by a lysine-dependent recognition system.

Glutaraldehyde treatment of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (125I-native-LDL) produced a modified LDL (125I-glut-LDL) with a molecular weight of 10 × 106 or more. Malondialdehyde treatment of 125I-native-LDL produced a product (125I-MDA-LDL) with a molecular weight not appreciably different from that of the original lipoprotein. However, the electrophoretic mobility of MDA-LDL indicated a more negative charge than native-LDL. 125I-MDA-LDL was degraded by two processes: a high-affinity saturable process with maximal velocity at 10-15 μg of protein per ml and a slower, nonsaturable process. The degradation of 125I-MDA-LDL was readily inhibited by increasing concentrations of nonradioactive MDA-LDL but was not inhibited by acetylated LDL or native-LDL even at concentrations as high as 1600 μg of protein per ml. After exposure of native-LDL to blood platelet aggregation and release in vitro, 1.73 ± 0.19 nmol of malondialdehyde per mg of LDL protein was bound to the platelet-modified-LDL. No detectable malondialdehyde was recovered from native-LDL that had been treated identically except that the platelets were omitted from the reaction mixture.After incubation with glut-LDL, MDA-LDL, or platelet-modified-LDL for 3 days, human monocyte-macrophages showed a dramatic increase in cholesteryl ester content whereas the cholesteryl ester content of cells incubated with the same concentration of native-LDL did not. Based on these experiments we propose that modification of native-LDL may be a prerequisite to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters within the cells of the atherosclerotic reaction. We further hypothesize that one modification of LDL in vivo may result from malondialdehyde which is released from blood platelets or is produced by lipid peroxidation at the site of arterial injury.Images	Malondialdehyde alteration of low density lipoproteins leads to cholesteryl ester accumulation in human monocyte-macrophages	Alan M.

1. The inactivation of cytosol enzymes by a rat liver membrane protein was studied with crude microsomal fraction, plasma membranes or a partially purified preparation of inactivation factor. 2. Complete inactivation of 125I-labelled glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) by membranes did not result in any detectable change in molecular weight when the products were analysed by gradient polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 3. Inactivation of radioactive enzyme was not accompanied by extensive binding to the membrane surface. The maximum extent of binding was 15% of the total enzyme labelled, and bound radioactivity was released only slowly, mainly as trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. 4. Treatment of membranes with dithiothreitol destroyed the inactivation capacity, whereas the thiol-alkylating agent iodoacetamide had no effect. Partial restoration of the inactivation capacity of reduced membranes after exposure to air was prevented by membrane alkylation with iodoacetamide. 5. Modification of enzyme thiol groups during inactivation was determined by measuring a decrease in iodoacetamide-reactive groups in purified glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. 6. Incubation of membrane-inactivated glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase with dithiothreitol resulted in a partial restoration of enzyme activity. 7. As a result of these experiments it is concluded that inactivation proceeds by a disulphide–thiol exchange mechanism. The proposal that this reaction could be involved in the initial step of enzyme degradation is discussed.

Thiol and glutathione (GSH) efflux across the sinusoidal plasma membrane in isolated perfused rat liver was stimulated by addition of hormones such as vasopressin, phenylephrine and adrenaline, whereas glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP were without effect. Phenylephrine and adrenaline effects were sensitive to prazosin and phentolamine, respectively. The increase in thiol efflux was largely accounted for by an increase in GSH efflux. Thiol efflux and the hormone effects were abolished in GSH-depleted liver. Biliary GSH efflux was diminished upon hormone addition. The newly discovered hormone-dependence of GSH release across the sinusoidal plasma membrane may explain the known loss of GSH during conditions of experimental shock (traumatic or endotoxin) and stress and peripheral inflammation.

1. The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the `malic' enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) were measured in freeze-clamped rat livers. By assuming that the reactants of these dehydrogenase systems are at equilibrium in the cytoplasm the [free NADP+]/[free NADPH] ratio was calculated. The justification of the assumption is discussed. 2. The values of this ratio obtained under different nutritional conditions (well-fed, 48hr.-starved, fed with a low-carbohydrate diet, fed with a high-sucrose diet) were all of the same order of magnitude although characteristic changes occurred on varying the diet. The value of the ratio fell on starvation and on feeding with the low-carbohydrate diet and rose slightly on feeding with the high-sucrose diet. 3. The mean values of the ratio were calculated to be between 0·001 and 0·015, which is about 100000 times lower than the values of the cytoplasmic [free NAD+]/[free NADH] ratio. 4. The differences in the redox state of the two nicotinamide–adenine dinucleotide couples can be explained on a simple physicochemical basis. The differences are the result of equilibria that are determined by the equilibrium constants of a number of highly active readily reversible dehydrogenases and transaminases and the concentrations of the substrates and products of these enzymes. 5. The decisive feature is the fact that the NAD and NADP couples share substrates. This sharing provides a link between the redox states of the two couples. 6. The application of the method of calculation to data published by Kraupp, Adler-Kastner, Niessner & Plank (1967), Goldberg, Passonneau & Lowry (1966) and Kauffman, Brown, Passonneau & Lowry (1968) shows that the redox states of the NAD and NADP couples in cardiac-muscle cytoplasm and in mouse-brain cytoplasm are of the same order as those in rat liver. 7. The determination of the equilibrium constant at 38°, pH7·0 and I 0·25 (required for the calculation of the [free NADP+]/[free NADPH] ratio), gave a value of 3·44×10−2m for the `malic' enzyme (with CO2 rather than HCO3− as the reactant) and a value of 1·98×10−2m−1 for glutathione reductase.

The spectrophotometric determination of the catalase-H2O2 intermediate (Compound I) was extended to the liver in situ in anaesthetized rats. The rate of H2O2 production was determined for the liver in situ with endogenous substrates, and in the presence of excess of glycollate. Glycollate infusion doubled H2O2 production rate in the liver of air-breathing rats, and caused a fourfold increase when rats breathed O2 at 1 times 10(5) Pa. Hyperbaric O2 up to 6 times 10(5) Pa did not increase H2O2 generation supported by endogenous substrates, nor did it increase H2O2 production above that produced by 1 times 10(5) Pa O2 in glycollate-supplemented rats. The rates of ethanol oxidation via hepatic catalase and via alcohol dehydrogenase in the whole body were separately measured. The contribution of hepatic catalase to ethanol oxidation was found to be approx. 10 percent in endogenous conditions and increased to 30 percent or more of the total ethanol oxidation in rats supplemented with glycolate.

1. A search was made for mechanisms which may exert a `fine' control of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in rat liver, the rate-limiting step of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle. 2. The glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction is expected to go virtually to completion because the primary product (6-phosphogluconate lactone) is rapidly hydrolysed and the equilibrium of the joint dehydrogenase and lactonase reactions is in favour of virtually complete formation of phosphogluconate. However, the reaction does not go to completion, because glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is inhibited by NADPH (Neglein & Haas, 1935). 3. Measurements of the inhibition (which is competitive with NADP+) show that at physiological concentrations of free NADP+ and free NADPH the enzyme is almost completely inhibited. This indicates that the regulation of the enzyme activity is a matter of de-inhibition. 4. Among over 100 cell constituents tested only GSSG and AMP counteracted the inhibition by NADPH; only GSSG was highly effective at concentrations that may be taken to occur physiologically. 5. The effect of GSSG was not due to the GSSG reductase activity of liver extracts, because under the test conditions the activity of this enzyme was very weak, and complete inhibition of the reductase by Zn2+ did not abolish the GSSG effect. 6. Preincubation of the enzyme preparation with GSSG in the presence of Mg2+ and NADP+ before the addition of glucose 6-phosphate and NADPH much increased the GSSG effect. 7. Dialysis of liver extracts and purification of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase abolished the GSSG effect, indicating the participation of a cofactor in the action of GSSG. 8. The cofactor removed by dialysis or purification is very unstable. The cofactor could be separated from glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by ultrafiltration of liver homogenates. Some properties of the cofactor are described. 9. The hypothesis that GSSG exerts a fine control of the pentose phosphate cycle by counteracting the NADPH inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is discussed.

The effects on the uptake (cell-associated 125I) and degradation (125I-labelled products released into the medium) of 125I-insulin and bioactivity (protein, glycogen and lipid synthesis) of insulin caused by altering the cellular thiol/disulphide status in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were studied. Incubation of hepatocyte cultures with various exogenous thiol compounds (reduced glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteamine, dithiothreitol) resulted in increased insulin binding, but markedly decreased degradation and bioactivity. These effects could be reversed by washing or by the addition of oxidized glutathione, which alone had no effect. When cultures were exposed to certain thiol-modifying reagents (N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate, iodoacetamide, iodoacetate), some decreases in bioactivity were evident, but the pronounced decrease in insulin degradation observed with the thiol-containing compounds was not observed with this class of compounds. None of the thiol-containing or -modifying agents tested had any significant effect on cellular ATP concentrations, indicating that the effects observed were due to perturbation of the thiol/disulphide status. Depletion of intracellular glutathione by DL-buthionine SR-sulphoximine (a specific inhibitor of glutathionine biosynthesis) decreased the syntheses of glycogen and lipid by about one-half, while having essentially no effect on protein synthesis, ATP concentrations or on the binding and degradation of insulin. The data presented here indicate that although intracellular thiol (glutathione) concentrations may be important for the maintenance of full expression of certain biological activities (glycogen and lipid synthesis), the thiol/disulphide groups on the cell surface and those immediately inside the cell membrane may be more critical in the mediation of insulin action, including the degradation and bioactivity of insulin in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.

Binding of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) to rat cerebellum membranes has previously been shown to be stimulated by alkaline pH and inhibited by low concentrations of Ca2+ [Worley, Baraban, Suppatopone, Wilson & Snyder (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12132-12136]. In the present study, Scatchard analysis of InsP3 binding to cerebellum microsomes indicates that the effects of Ca2+ and pH are exerted through changes in the apparent affinity of the receptor without effects on maximal binding. The influence of extravesicular Ca2+ and pH on InsP3-mediated 45Ca2+ release was investigated. Extravesicular Ca2+ inhibited InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ was most marked when a sub-optimal concentration of InsP3 was used. An increase in extravesicular pH produced a decrease in the concentration of InsP3 that yielded half-maximal Ca2+ release. Regulation of the affinity of the InsP3 receptor by Ca2+ and pH can qualitatively account for the observed effects of these factors on InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. Feedback inhibition of InsP3 binding by Ca2+ could provide a mechanism to generate Ca2+ oscillations, particularly under hormonal conditions that produce sub-optimal elevations of InsP3 concentration.

Thapsigargin, a tumor-promoting sesquiterpene lactone, discharges intracellular Ca2+ in rat hepatocytes, as it does in many vertebrate cell types. It appears to act intracellularly, as incubation of isolated rat liver microsomes with thapsigargin induces a rapid, dose-dependent release of stored Ca2+. The thapsigargin-releasable pool of microsomal Ca2+ includes the pools sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and GTP. Thapsigargin pretreatment of microsomes blocks subsequent loading with 45Ca2+, suggesting that its target is the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump of endoplasmic reticulum. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the demonstration that thapsigargin causes a rapid inhibition of the Ca2(+)-activated ATPase activity of rat liver microsomes, with an identical dose dependence to that seen in whole cell or isolated microsome Ca2+ discharge. The inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum isoform of the Ca2(+)-ATPase is highly selective, as thapsigargin has little or no effect on the Ca2(+)-ATPases of hepatocyte or erythrocyte plasma membrane or of cardiac or skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that thapsigargin increases the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ in sensitive cells by an acute and highly specific arrest of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, followed by a rapid Ca2+ leak from at least two pharmacologically distinct Ca2+ stores. The implications of this mechanism of action for the application of thapsigargin in the analysis of Ca2+ homeostasis and possible forms of Ca2+ control are discussed.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum of the frog's sartorius muscle was examined by electron microscopy following sequential fixation in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide and embedding in Epon. The earlier results of Porter and Palade on Ambystoma muscle were confirmed in the sartorius. In addition, the transverse tubules were observed to be continuous across the width of the fiber, a set of flat intermediate cisternae was seen to connect the terminal cisternae to the longitudinal tubules in the A band, and the continuous reticulum collar at the center of the A band was found to be perforated by circular and elongated pores (the fenestrated collar). The transverse tubules have a volume about 0.3 per cent of the fiber volume, and a surface area about 7 times the outer cylindrical surface area for a fiber 100 µ in diameter. The terminal cisternae, the intermediate cisternae, and the longitudinal tubules together with the fenestrated collar each have a volume of 4 to 5 per cent of the fiber volume and a surface area 40 to 50 times the outer surface area of a fiber 100 µ in diameter. Some evidence for continuity of the transverse tubules with the fiber surface is presented, but this is thought to be not so convincing as evidence presented by others. The results are discussed in terms of a possible mechanism for a role of the transverse tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitation-contraction coupling, as suggested by their morphology and a variety of physiological studies. In this scheme, the transverse tubules are thought to be electrically coupled to the terminal cisternae, so that depolarization of the fiber surface spreads inward along the transverse tubules and to the terminal cisternae, initiating the release of a contraction-activating substance.

Isolated heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles retain junctional specializations (feet) on their outer surface. We have obtained en face three-dimensional views of the feet by shadowing and replicating the surfaces of freeze-dried isolated vesicles. Feet are clearly visible as large structures located on raised platforms. New details of foot structure include a four subunit structure and the fact that adjacent feet do not abut directly corner to corner but are offset by half a subunit. Feet aligned within rows were observed to be rotated at a slight angle off the long axis of the row creating a center-to-center spacing (32.5 nm) slightly less than the average diagonal of the feet (35.3 nm). Comparison with previous information from thin sections and freeze-fracture showed that this approach to the study of membranes faithfully preserves structure and allows better visualization of surface details than either thin-sectioning or negative-staining.

The force-velocity relation was determined in fully activated skinned fibres from frog muscle at concentrations of the substrate, magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP), ranging from 10 microM to 10 mM. The ionic strength of the solutions was 200 mM, temperature 0-5 degrees C, pH 7.1. The activation procedure of Moisescu (1976) was used to raise the calcium concentration rapidly in the interior of the fibres. A re-phosphorylating system (creatine kinase and creatine phosphate) was used to maintain the MgATP concentration in the fibres. Isotonic releases were performed using a fast servo-controlled motor and tension transducer. Releases to a pre-determined tension level relative to the isometric tension were made using a novel normalizing circuit. In some of the experiments changes of sarcomere length were recorded using the diffraction device described in the preceding paper (Goldman & Simmons, 1984). There was satisfactory agreement between velocities determined from the total length change and the sarcomere length change. The isometric tension showed a biphasic dependence on MgATP concentration. Tension increased with MgATP concentration from 1 microM to reach a peak at about 30-100 microM and decreased by about 20% from the value at the peak with further increase in the MgATP concentration to 5 mM (about the physiological concentration). At 5 mM-MgATP, the isometric tension was approximately the same as in intact fibres, if allowance is made for the increase in cross-sectional area that occurs when the surface membrane is removed. The maximum velocity of shortening, Vmax, was obtained by fitting the force-velocity relation using Hill's (1938) equation. Vmax showed a roughly hyperbolic dependence on MgATP concentration, with a Km of 0.47 mM. At 5 mM-MgATP, the value of Vmax was 2.16 muscle lengths per second, which is similar to that of intact fibres. a/P0, the parameter of Hill's (1938) equation that is related to the curvature of the force-velocity relation, showed a slight decrease with increasing MgATP concentration. Its value at 5 mM-MgATP of 0.16 is somewhat lower than found for intact fibres. The results are discussed in terms of a simple model based on the biochemical cycle of hydrolysis of ATP by actomyosin in solution. The decrease of tension from about 30 microM to higher concentrations of MgATP can be related to the dissociating effect of MgATP on actomyosin. The increase of isometric tension from 1 to 30 microM-MgATP is discussed in terms of two types of rigor attachment of cross-bridges which support different amounts of tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	The dependence of force and shortening velocity on substrate concentration in skinned muscle fibres from Rana temporaria.

The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle was investigated by several methods. The following results were obtained. InsP3 is released by electrical stimulation of muscles. Exogenous InsP3 releases calcium from skinned muscle fibers at relatively high doses under normal conditions but does so at very low concentrations when blockers of the InsP3 5-phosphatase are present. Blockers of InsP3 release are effective blockers of calcium transients elicited by electrical stimulation of muscle fibers. It is proposed that InsP3 acts as a chemical second messenger between transverse (T)-tubular membrane depolarization and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle.

The contractile apparatus of mechanically skinned muscle fibres of frog can be reversibly activated by Ba2+ and Cd2+. The maximum force induced by both Ba2+ and Cd2+ is the same as that induced by Ca2+ and Sr2+. The ionic concentrations of the divalent cations required to induce 50% of the maximum activated force at 1 mM-Mg2+, pH 7.10, 22 degrees C and 250 mM ionic strength are about 8 X 10(-7) M for Ca2+, 5 X 10(-6) M for Cd2+, 2.6 X 10(-5) M for Sr2+ and 7 X 10(-4) M for Ba2+. Exposure of the skinned fibre to relatively low Ni2+ concentrations (between 10(-6) and 10(-5) M) resulted in a transient force response accompanied by an irreversible change in the ability of the preparation to develop force. The Ba2+- and Cd2+-activation curves are considerably flatter than the corresponding curves for Ca2+ and Sr2+. An increase in Mg2+ concentration from 1 to 3 mM decreased the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ba2+ by a factor of about 1.5 without affecting the maximum force response. The Ca2+-activation curve was modified in the presence of subthreshold concentrations of Ba2+ and the results indicate that Ba2+ could have both an activating and an inhibitory action on the Ca2+-activated force. A kinetic model which can quantitatively explain the results for activation of contraction by Ba2+ and Ca2+, is described.

1. Force development and 45Ca movement between the internal membranes and the myofilament space were measured in segments of skinned muscle fibres.2. At 20° C calcium ions in the myofilament space of calcium loaded fibres caused the internal membranes to release a substantial amount of calcium which produced a large force spike. Calcium produced a similar force spike in fibres containing only the physiological level of calcium when the temperature was lowered to about 6° C.3. The force spike at 6° C was inhibited when the magnesium concentration in the bathing solution was increased from 1 to 6 mM. The pattern of force development in preparations transferred directly from oil to a free calcium solution indicated that the normal concentration of Mg2+ in the myofilament space of intact fibres is of the order of 10-3 M.4. A possible role for the regenerative calcium release mechanism in the physiological activation of muscle fibres is suggested.	Intracellular calcium movements in skinned muscle fibres	L. E. Ford, R.

Isometric force and 45Ca efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum were measured at 19 degrees C in frog skeletal muscle fibers skinned by microdissection. After Ca2+ loading, application of the ionophores monensin, an Na+(K+)/H+ exchanger, or gramicidin D, an H+ greater than K+ greater than Na+ channel-former, evoked rapid force development and stimulated release of approximately 30% of the accumulated 45Ca within 1 min, whereas CCCP (carbonyl cyanide pyruvate p-trichloromethoxyphenylhydrazone), a protonophore, and valinomycin, a neutral, K+-specific ionophore, did not. When monensin was present in all bathing solutions, i.e., before and during Ca2+ loading, subsequent application failed to elicit force development and to stimulate 45Ca efflux. 5 min pretreatment of the skinned fibers with 50 microM digitoxin, a permeant glycoside that specifically inhibits the Na+,K+ pump, inhibited monensin and gramicidin D stimulation of 45Ca efflux; similar pretreatment with 100 microM ouabain, an impermeant glycoside, was ineffective. Monensin stimulation of 45Ca efflux was abolished by brief pretreatment with 5 mM EGTA, which chelates myofilament-space calcium. These results suggest that: monensin and gramicidin D stimulate Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that is mediated by depolarization of the transverse tubules, which seal off after sarcolemma removal and form closed compartments; a transverse tubule membrane potential (myofilament space-negative) is maintained and/or established by the operation of the Na+,K+ pump in the transverse tubule membranes and is sensitive to the permeant inhibitor digitoxin; the transverse tubule-mediated stimulation of 45Ca efflux appears to be entirely Ca2+ dependent.

A high-conductance (100 pS in 53 mM trans Ca2+) Ca2+ channel was incorporated from heavy-density skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) fractions into planar lipid bilayers of the Mueller-Rudin type. cis Ca2+ in the range of 2-950 microM increased open probability (Po) in single channel records without affecting open event lifetimes. Millimolar ATP was found to be as good as or better than Ca2+ in activation; however, both Ca2+ and ATP were required to fully activate the channel, i.e., to bring Po = 1. Exponential fits to open and closed single channel lifetimes suggested that the channel may exist in many distinct states. Two open and two closed states were identified when the channel was activated by either Ca2+ or ATP alone or by Ca2+ plus nucleotide. Mg2+ was found to permeate the SR Ca channel in a trans-to- cis direction such that iMg2+/iCa2+ = 0.40. cis Mg2+ was inhibitory and in single channel recordings produced an unresolvable flickering of Ca- and nucleotide-activated channels. At nanomolar cis Ca2+, 4 microM Mg2+ completely inhibited nucleotide-activated channels. In the presence of 2 microM cis Ca2+, the nucleotide-activated macroscopic Ba conductance was inhibited by cis Mg2+ with an IC50 equal to 1.5 mM.

Micromolar concentrations of mercury, silver, and other reagents known to react with sulfhydryl groups are shown to stimulate ATPase activity and inhibit active calcium uptake in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles derived from rabbit fast skeletal muscle. These effects are caused by a dramatic increase in the calcium permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Measurements of Ca2+ permeability were made using both isotopes and by spectrophotometric techniques using the Ca2+ indicator arsenazo III. Air oxidation of a sulfhydryl group to a disulfide group also leads to a large increase in the calcium permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The intracellular Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, was used to monitor changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] in parotid acinar cells. When parotid cells were incubated in a medium containing low [Ca2+], and [Ca2+] was restored to the physiological range, there was a small increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]. If, however, the cells were first activated by a muscarinic agonist, and receptor activation was terminated before the addition of Ca2+ by the addition of a pharmacological excess of the muscarinic-receptor antagonist atropine, the initial increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] was faster and transiently larger than in the control cells which had not been previously stimulated. This suggested that a stimulation of Ca2+ entry occurred owing to the prior emptying of the agonist-regulated intracellular Ca2+ pool. This extra Ca2+ influx seen in pool-depleted cells persisted even when the interval between the addition of atropine and Ca2+ was increased from 1 to 20 min. Also, when the pool was allowed to refill by adding atropine in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and Ca2+ was then sequentially removed and restored, the rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] after the addition of extracellular Ca2+ was not rapid, and resembled the increase seen in unstimulated cells. These results indicate that, when the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool is emptied by an agonist, Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane is increased. This influx of Ca2+ occurs independently of the concentrations of inositol phosphates and probably of any second messengers linked directly to receptor activation. It appears rather to be a consequence of the empty state of the Ca2+ pool. Further, we suggest that, whenever the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool is emptied by agonist activation, the plasma-membrane permeability to Ca2+ will be increased, and this may account, at least in part, for the phenomenon of receptor-activated Ca2+ entry.

Receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry was studied in fura-2-loaded isolated hepatocytes. Emptying of internal Ca2+ stores by treatment with either the Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormone vasopressin or the inhibitors of the microsomal Ca2+ pump, 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) or thapsigargin, stimulated Ca2+ entry, as indicated by a rise in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration after Ca2+ was added to cells suspended in nominally Ca(2+)-free medium. The enhancement of Ca2+ entry was proportional to the degree of depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool and occurred also after removal of vasopressin from its receptor. In contrast, the stimulation of Mn2+ entry by vasopressin required the continuous presence of the agonist, since it was prevented by the addition of vasopressin receptor antagonist. This effect was observed under conditions where refilling of the agonist-sensitive pool was prevented by using nominally Ca(2+)-free medium. Unlike vasopressin, tBuBHQ or thapsigargin did not stimulate Mn2+ entry. These results suggest the existence of two pathways for receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry in hepatocytes, a 'capacitative' pathway that is sensitive to the Ca2+ content in the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool and does not allow Mn2+ entry, and a second pathway that depends on receptor occupation, seems to require a second messenger for activation, and permits influx of Mn2+.

Previous studies in non-excitable cells have suggested that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space via a mechanism that does not require stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis in vascular endothelial cells, the effect of the Ca(2+)-ATPase/pump inhibitor 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was examined. BHQ produced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which remained elevated over basal values for several minutes and was substantially inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Application of bradykinin after BHQ demonstrated that the BHQ-sensitive compartment partially overlapped the bradykinin-sensitive store. Similar results were obtained with thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, two other Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors. Although BHQ had no effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis, both 45Ca2+ influx and efflux were stimulated by this agent. These results suggest that depletion of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ store is sufficient for activation of Ca2+ influx. Several characteristics of the Ca(2+)-influx pathway activated by internal store depletion were compared with those of the agonist-activated pathway. Bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ influx was increased at alkaline extracellular pH (pHo), and was inhibited by extracellular La3+, by depolarization of the membrane, and by the novel Ca(2+)-influx blocker 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4- methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF 96365). Additionally, bradykinin stimulated influx of both 45Ca2+ and 133Ba2+, consistent with the hypothesis that the agonist-activated influx pathway is permeable to both of these bivalent cations. Likewise, activation of Ca2+ influx by BHQ, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid was blocked by La3+, membrane depolarization and SKF 96365, but was unaffected by nitrendipine or BAY K 8644. Furthermore, Ca2+ influx stimulated by BHQ was increased at alkaline pHo and BHQ stimulated the influx of both 45Ca2+ and 133Ba2+ to the same extent. These results demonstrate that the agonist-activated Ca(2+)-influx pathway and the pathway activated by depletion of the agonist-sensitive internal Ca2+ store are indistinguishable.

In suspensions of isolated hepatocytes, two intracellular Ca2+ pools were distinguished in the presence of the metallochrome indicator arsenazo III, first by treatment with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and then with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The available evidence indicates that the two pools are of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial origin. Metabolism of t-butyl hydroperoxide by hepatocytes caused release of Ca2+ from both compartments concomitant with oxidation of cellular glutathione and NADPH, which was followed by characteristic alterations in cell surface structure. When NADPH oxidation was prevented by selective inactivation of glutathione reductase, t-butyl hydroperoxide metabolism was without effect on the mitochondrial Ca2+ pool, whereas the loss from the extramitochondrial pool was accelerated. Our results suggest that different regulatory mechanisms modulate mitochondrial (NADPH-dependent) and extramitochondrial (thiol-dependent) Ca2+ compartmentation and that disturbance of normal Ca2+ homeostasis may be critical in peroxide-induced cytotoxicity.Images	Regulation of intracellular calcium compartmentation: studies with isolated hepatocytes and t-butyl hydroperoxide.

Bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetylcholine each relaxed histamine-contracted strips of pig aorta in a dose-dependent manner. These relaxations were abolished when the endothelium was removed. Relaxation induced by ATP was mimicked by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) but adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine were about 120 times less potent. Relaxation induced by acetylcholine was antagonized by atropine in a competitive manner, and carbachol induced the same degree of relaxation as acetylcholine, but was about 10 times less potent. The calcium ionophore, A23187, also induced a dose-dependent relaxation of pig aortic strips provided the endothelium was present, suggesting that a rise in the level of ionized calcium within the endothelial cells is one means by which vascular smooth muscle relaxation can be triggered. Bradykinin, ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine and A23187 each induced a dose-dependent increase in 86Rb efflux from preloaded pig aortic endothelial cells. The dose-response curves for stimulation of 86Rb efflux and for endothelium-dependent relaxation were similar for each individual compound. ADP was equipotent with ATP, but AMP and adenosine were about 120 times less potent. Neither acetylcholine nor carbachol, in concentrations that induce endothelium-dependent relaxation, had any effect on 86Rb efflux from isolated aortic endothelial cells. Lanthanum, which blocks calcium influx, abolished the increases in 86Rb efflux induced by bradykinin and ATP, and the calcium ionophore A23187 was the most effective stimulant of 86Rb efflux, suggesting that the potassium transport induced by these agents is calcium-activated. It is concluded that endothelial responses to bradykinin and ATP can be assessed by monitoring 86Rb efflux, which probably reflects a calcium-activated efflux of potassium associated with the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation induced by these agents. This pathway is apparently not involved in endothelial responses to acetylcholine.ImagesFigure 1	Endothelium-dependent relaxation of the pig aorta: relationship to stimulation of 86Rb efflux from isolated endothelial cells.

1. Single-channel currents evoked in outside-out membrane patches from rat cerebellar granule cells by glutamate, aspartate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and quisqualate were studied. Each agonist produced openings to five discrete amplitude levels. At a membrane potential of -70 mV, these levels correspond to single-channel conductances of about 8, 17, 30, 40 and 50 pS. NMDA, aspartate and glutamate evoked mainly 50 pS openings and also substantial numbers of 40 pS events. Kainate evoked primarily 8 and 17 pS openings. 2. The relative proportion of openings to each conductance level showed no dependence on membrane potential. At membrane potentials negative to -100 mV, current-voltage plots for 30, 40 and 50 pS openings showed substantial inward rectification. 3. With NMDA, aspartate and glutamate, the most common type of direct transition was between the 50 pS open level and the shut level. Transitions between the 30, 40 and 50 pS levels were also relatively common. With few exceptions, 8 and 17 pS openings appeared to arise directly from, and return directly to, the shut level. The differences between granule cells and certain other central neurones, in the types of transitions associated with NMDA receptor channels, provide evidence for the existence of more than one type of NMDA receptor. 4. Four exponential components were identified consistently in the shut-time distributions that were obtained with NMDA, aspartate and glutamate. Mean time constants for the briefest two components were 30 to 65 microseconds and 0.65 to 1.00 ms. The mean duration of these 'gaps within bursts' differed for different agonists, but did not vary with membrane potential. 5. Two exponential components were distinguished in most open-time distributions for the 50 pS level (time constants, 0.9-1.2 and 3.2-3.9 ms at -100 mV), whereas open-time distributions for 30 and 40 pS events were described adequately by single exponentials with time constants below 1.0 ms. The duration of 50 pS openings decreased with hyperpolarization. 6. Mean open times for 8 and 17 pS events produced by NMDA, aspartate and glutamate were 0.3 to 0.7 ms. The longest such openings were observed with quisqualate. 7. Three exponential components were present in distributions of burst length, and of total open time per burst, that were obtained with NMDA, aspartate and glutamate. The slowest two burst-length components had mean time constants of 1.7-2.4 and 10.6-13.0 ms and originated from the kinetic behaviour of the 50 pS state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Currents through single glutamate receptor channels in outside-out patches from rat cerebellar granule cells.

1. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), and kainate receptor channels have been examined in rat cerebellar granule neurones with whole-cell and single-channel patch-clamp methods. The whole-cell peak and steady-state aspartate and NMDA currents were reversibly inhibited by extracellular protons; the IC50 (concentration producing half-maximal inhibition) for the full H+ inhibition curve for NMDA receptors corresponded to pH 7.3, near to physiological pH. (S)-AMPA and kainate whole-cell currents were inhibited by protons with IC50 values that corresponded to pH 6.3 and 5.7, respectively; these receptors were, however, insensitive to H+ concentrations that inhibited NMDA receptor responses. 2. Proton inhibition of the NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptor-mediated responses was voltage insensitive, and did not involve a shift in reversal potential. 3. The EC50 (concentration producing half-maximal effect) for aspartate calculated from the whole-cell dose-response curve was similar at pH 6.8 and 7.6 (mean 11.2 microM). Although the EC50 for glycine potentiation of the aspartate response was marginally increased from 273 nM at pH 7.6 to 373 nM at pH 6.8, H+ inhibition was not overcome by up to 1 mM-external glycine. Inhibiting concentrations of H+ appropriate for AMPA and kainate receptors did not markedly alter the EC50 values determined for (S)-AMPA (3.4 microM) and kainate (114 microM) at pH 7.2. 4. Treatment of neurones with N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetic acid, dithiothretiol or diethyl pyrocarbonate did not influence proton inhibition of NMDA receptor responses. However, treatment with diethyl pyrocarbonate, which potentiated aspartate responses, appeared to reduce the effectiveness of Zn2+ inhibition of NMDA receptors. 5. Desensitization of whole-cell NMDA and (S)-AMPA currents was studied with ionophoretic application of agonist to the cell soma. Whole-cell aspartate currents desensitized rapidly, irrespective of the glycine concentration. Increased H+ concentrations did not detectably alter the ratio of peak/steady-state current, or the time constants describing the onset of, or recovery from, desensitization. The time constant describing desensitization of (S)-AMPA-induced whole-cell currents also appeared unchanged by inhibiting pH (6.2). 6. The amplitudes of aspartate- or NMDA-activated single-channel multiple conductance levels were unchanged by decreasing the pH to 6.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Pharmacological properties and H+ sensitivity of excitatory amino acid receptor channels in rat cerebellar granule neurones.

1. Spinal cord and hippocampal neurones in cell culture were voltage clamped using the tight-seal, whole-cell recording technique. The concentration of sodium and a series of divalent cations in the extracellular media was varied to study permeation through excitatory amino acid receptor channels activated by the selective agonists N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), kainic acid and quisqualic acid. 2. On raising the extracellular calcium concentration, with [Na+]o held constant at 105 mM, the reversal potential of responses to NMDA shifted in the depolarizing direction. This shift was adequately described by the extended constant-field equation over the range 0.3-50 mM-calcium. Using ionic activity coefficients we calculate a value of PCa/PNa = 10.6. Under the same experimental conditions the reversal potential of responses to kainic and quisqualic acids was much less affected by raising the calcium concentration, such that PCa/PNa = 0.15. A depolarizing shift of the NMDA reversal potential was also recorded during application of 20 mM-barium, strontium or manganese, suggesting permeation of these ions. The permeability sequence was Ca2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Sr2+ much greater than Mn2+. No depolarizing shift of the NMDA reversal potential occurred during application of 20 mM-cobalt, magnesium or nickel. 3. In experiments in which the extracellular Na+ concentration was varied the extended constant-field equation was adequate in predicting shifts of the NMDA reversal potential recorded on varying [Na+]o over the range 50-150 mM, but failed to accurately predict the reversal potential of responses to NMDA with 10 mM-[Ca2+]o and only 10 or 20 mM-[Na+]o. These results imply an apparent increase in PCa/PNa on lowering [Na+]o and may result from interaction of permeant ions within the channel. 4. Barium and to a lesser extent calcium, but not strontium (all 20 mM), reduced the slope conductance of responses to NMDA recorded within +/- 15 mV of the reversal potential; over this limited range of membrane potential the current-voltage relationship remained linear in the presence of each of these ions. In contrast manganese produced a strong, voltage-dependent block of responses to NMDA, similar to that produced by magnesium, such that even close to the reversal potential the NMDA current-voltage relationship was highly non-linear. Thus manganese both permeates and blocks the NMDA receptor channel. 5. Raising the extracellular calcium concentration, from 0.1 to 5 mM, had two effects on the conductance mechanism activated by NMDA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Permeation and block of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor channels by divalent cations in mouse cultured central neurones.

1. Single-channel currents activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists were analysed in the presence of various extracellular concentrations of divalent cations in outside-out patches from mouse neurones in primary culture. 2. In nominally Mg2+-free solutions the opening and closing of the channels leads to rectangular current pulses, the mean duration of which varies little with membrane potential. After addition of Mg2+, the single-channel currents recorded at negative potentials appear in bursts of short openings separated by brief closures. 3. The duration of the short openings decreases with increasing Mg2+ concentration, while the duration of the short closures is independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Depolarization increases the duration of the short openings and decreases the duration of the short closures. 4. The dependence of the burst structure on the Mg2+ concentration and on membrane potential is compatible to a first approximation with a model in which Mg2+ ions enter the open channel and block it by binding at a deep site. A better approximation requires, however, additional assumptions such as Mg2+ permeation and/or interactions between Ca2+ and Mg2+. 5. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 1 to 100 mM produces three effects on the currents flowing through NMDA channels. It shifts the reversal potential towards a positive value (+30 mV); it reduces the outward current flowing through the NMDA channels at very positive potentials; it reduces the inward current flowing at negative potentials. 6. The interpretation of the effects of Ca2+ appears to require three hypotheses: that Ca2+ permeates the NMDA channel, that there exists a significant surface potential at the entrance of the NMDA channel in physiological solutions and that both Ca2+ and monovalent cations bind to the channel, binding being stronger in the case of Ca2+ ions. 7. While Co2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mn2+ mimic the effects of Mg2+ on the NMDA channel, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Cd2+ do not. The distinction between Mg2+-like and Ca2+-like divalent cations corresponds to a difference in the speed of exchange of the water molecules surrounding the cations in solutions. Thus, it is possible that permeation occurs for all the divalent cations, but is slower for those which are slowly dehydrated.

1. Single-channel currents evoked by excitatory amino acids have been examined in outside-out patches from large cerebellar neurones (including Purkinje cells) in tissue culture. L-Glutamate (3-10 microM), L-aspartate (3-10 microM), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate, 10-50 microM), ibotenate (50 microM), quisqualate (3-50 microM), and kainate (3-50 microM) all produced single-channel currents with multiple amplitudes. 2. Single-channel currents recorded over a range of patch potentials had a mean interpolated reversal potential of -3.8 +/- 0.5 mV. The directly resolvable multiple conductance levels could be classified into five main groups, with mean values (averaged for all agonists) of: 47.9 +/- 0.7, 38.5 +/- 0.8, 27.8 +/- 1.4, 18.2 +/- 0.5 and 8.3 +/- 0.6 pS. 3. From the relative areas under current amplitude histograms it was estimated that the percentage of openings with conductances greater than 30 pS was about 83% with NMDA, 79% with glutamate and 78% with aspartate. In some patches, the majority of greater than 30 pS events evoked by these agonists were to the maximum conductance of 48 pS, whereas in other patches there were more 38 pS openings than 48 pS openings. Only 27% of quisqualate openings, and about 10% of kainate openings, were greater than 30 pS. 4. Of the small amplitude (less than 20 pS) events, 93% of quisqualate openings were to the 8 pS level whereas approximately 87% of less than 20 pS currents produced by NMDA, glutamate and aspartate were to the 18 pS level (the remainder being 8 pS). Direct transitions could occur between certain levels (including events above and below 30 pS) suggesting that these are sublevels of multiple-conductance channels. The most frequently occurring transitions were between the 48 and 38 pS levels, and the 38 and 18 pS levels. 5. Channel openings occurred in bursts, within which individual openings were separated either by brief closures (gaps), or by direct transitions between the multiple conductance levels. The briefest of these gaps (less than 200-400 microseconds) could represent a mixture of transitions to lower conductance levels as well as partially resolved complete shuttings. The mean duration of the longer gaps within bursts, thought to represent complete but partially resolved shuttings was 1.05 +/- 0.25 ms (pooled for all agonists). 6. Burst-length distributions could be fitted with the sum of three exponentials. The briefest component may have arisen from brief single openings. The two slower components probably reflect the existence of two kinetically distinct open states.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	On the multiple-conductance single channels activated by excitatory amino acids in large cerebellar neurones of the rat.

1. Single channels activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) were studied in outside-out patches of cultured hippocampal neurones in the presence of glycine and absence of magnesium. The effects of the transition metal ions zinc and cadmium on NMDA channels were tested by placing the membrane patch at the mouth of one of an array of large barrelled flow pipes. 2. Amplitude histograms revealed several conductance levels between 5 and 45 pS with the majority of NMDA-activated openings greater than 25 pS. Zinc (5-100 microM) and cadmium (30-100 microM) reduced the number of large conductance events in a voltage-independent manner. Zinc (30 microM) reduced the large conductance openings by approximately 70-80%. The small number of events under 20 pS precluded quantitative assessment of the effects of zinc and cadmium on these conductance levels. Zinc inhibition of the calculated macroscopic current due to NMDA-activated channels could be fitted with a single binding site isotherm with an IC50 of 12 microM. 3. Zinc and cadmium also reduced the mean open time of the two largest conductance events of 38 and 43 pS; this reduction was voltage independent. Open-time histograms were fitted with the sum of two exponentials. In the presence of 5 microM-NMDA at -60 mV, tau o2 = 10.49 ms and tau o1 = 1.47 ms; in 30 microM-zinc, tau o2 = 3.49 and tau o1 = 0.8 ms. The 'blocking' rate constant calculated at a membrane potential of +40 mV from the slope of 1/tau o2 vs. [zinc]o was 4 x 10(6) M-1 S-1. 4. Closed-time analysis revealed brief (tau c = 0.4-1.0 ms) zinc-insensitive gaps; longer closed-time intervals were not analysed since all patches contained more than one channel. Both burst duration and the number of bursts were reduced in the presence of zinc. 5. At holding potentials negative to -40 mV in magnesium-free solutions, zinc also induced high-frequency flickering of the open channel which included complete channel closures at 4 kHz filtering. No zinc-induced flickering was seen at positive membrane potentials. The flickering was dose dependent, becoming prominent at zinc concentrations above 30 microM. Cadmium did not induce flickering at concentrations up to 100 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	The inhibition of single N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated channels by zinc ions on cultured rat neurones.

In several cell types, including hepatocytes, submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulate an initial rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores that is followed by either no further Ca2+ release or very much slower release. Further additions of Ins(1,4,5)P3 then evoke further Ca2+ mobilization. Such 'incremental' responses [Meyer & Stryer (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3841-3845] could result from all-or-nothing emptying of stores that differ in their sensitivities to Ins(1,4,5)P3 or from partial emptying of stores that are more uniformly sensitive, but unable to release all of their Ca2+ because the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 rapidly attenuates. By measuring unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from intracellular stores stimulated with Ins(1,4,5)P3 under conditions where they continue to sequester 40Ca2+, we provide evidence suggesting that Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulates all-or-nothing emptying of stores that differ in their sensitivities to Ins(1,4,5)P3, a quantal response pattern.

1. Extra- and intracellular recordings have been made of single units in the caudate nucleus of the cat, anaesthetized with alpha chloralose.2. Pentobarbitone was shown to depress the spontaneous activity and responses of units in the caudate nucleus.3. Spontaneous activity of units usually took the form of single spikes or bursts of up to four spikes occurring every 100-300 msec.4. The response to electrical stimulation of limb nerves was a burst of 1-4 spikes after a latency of about 30 msec. Convergence from all four limbs on to single units was observed. It is shown that muscle afferents do not cause these responses.5. Post stimulus histograms of spontaneously active units show, following stimulation of the limb nerves, recurring cycles of excitation and inhibition at a rate of 3-4 c/s and lasting for several seconds. It is suggested that each stimulus synchronizes the normally rhythmic spontaneous activity.6. Similar responses have been obtained following stimulation by clicks and flashes of light.7. Stimulation of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex gave excitatory and inhibitory responses similar to those described above.8. Possible mechanisms for these responses and their significance are discussed.ImagesFig. 6	The response of single units in the caudate nucleus to peripheral stimulation	E. M. Sedgwick, T. D.

The ability of a series of anions to inhibit [3H]strychnine binding to spinal cord synaptic membranes correlates closely with their neurophysiologic capacity to reverse inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the mammalian spinal cord. Seven neurophysiologically active anions are also effective inhibitors of [3H]strychnine binding with mean effective doses ranging from 160 to 620 mM. Seven other anions that are ineffective neurophysiologically also fail to alter strychnine binding. Chloride inhibits strychnine binding in a noncompetitive fashion. Hill plots of the displacement of [3H]strychnine by chloride give coefficients of 2.3-2.7. The inhibition of strychnine binding by these anions suggests that strychnine binding is closely associated with the ionic conductance mechanism for chloride in the glycine receptor.

1. 45-Ca uptake by pinched-off nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of rat brain incubated in standard physiological saline (including 132 mM-Na + 5mM-K + 1-2 mM-Ca) at 30 degrees C averages about 0-5 mumole Ca per g protein per minute. This may be equivalent to a Ca influx of about 0-03 p-mole/cm-2 sec. 2. The rate of 45-Ca uptake is increased when the concentration of K in the medium is increased above 15-20 mM, K replacing Na isosmotically. Maximum stimulation, a three- to six-fold increase in the rate of Ca uptake, occurs when [K]o is about 60 mM. The effect of increased [K]o is reversible. 3. The K-stimulated Ca uptake is associated primarily with the nerve terminal fraction of brain homogenates. The entering Ca is not accompanied by extracellular markers such as mannitol or inulin. Replacement of external chloride by methylsulphate or sulphate does not prevent the stimulation by K. 4. The effects of external K are quantitatively mimicked by Rb. Caesium also stimulates Ca uptake, but is only about one fifth as effective as K or Rb; Li is ineffective. 5. Two other depolarizing agents also stimulate Ca uptake by synaptosomes: veratridine (7-5 times 10- minus 6 to 7-5 times 10- minus 5 M) and scorpion (Leirus quinquestriatus) venom (6-7 times 10- minus 7 to 6-7 times 10- minus g/ml.). The stimulatory effects of veratridine and scorpion venom, but not of increased [K] are blocked by 2 times 10- minus 7 M tetrodotoxin. 6. Internal K also influences the rate of 45-Ca uptake by synaptosomes: lowering [K]i reduces the stimulatory effect of external K and veratridine. 7. Replacement of external Na by choline markedly inhibits the response to veratridine, but has a much smaller effect on the response to increased [K]o. 8. The Ca uptake mechanism has an apparent dissociation constant for Ca (KCa) of about 0-8 mM. Increasing [K]o increases the maximal rate of Ca uptake, but has no effect on KCa. The K-induced 45-Ca uptake is competitively inhibited by Mg-2+, Mn-2+ and La-3+. 9. The release of acetylcholine and noradrenaline was also studied. Increasing [K]o stimulates external Ca-dependent acetylcholine release. Scorpion venom stimulates noradrenaline release from synaptosomes; this effect could be prevented by adding tetrodotoxin or removing external Ca. 10. These results indicate that synaptosomes may increase their permeability to Ca, accumulate Ca and release neural transmitter substances, when stimulated by depolarizing agents under appropriate physiological conditions.

1. Some physiological properties of tissue fractions from rat brain homogenates have been examined. Of the three fractions studied (presynaptic nerve terminals, mitochondria and fragmented membranes), only the nerve terminals (synaptosomes) have the ability to accumulate 42K from physiological salt solutions. 2. The ability to accumulate and retain K is lost if synaptosomes are exposed to very hypotonic solutions. The K uptake and total K content is reduced by ouabain and by inhibitors of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. 3. These results suggest that synaptosomes in physiological saline accumulate K against a concentration gradient, and may have K diffusion potentials across their surface membranes. The voltage-sensitive fluorescent probe, 3,3'-dipentyl 2,2'-oxacarbocyanine (CC5), was used to test this possibility. 4. In the squid axon, the fluorescent emission of CC5 is directly proportional to membrane potential; depolarization causes an increase in fluorescence. 5. The fluorescence of synaptosomes ('synaptosome fluorescence') treated with CC5 is increased when [K]o is increased or [K]o is reduced; replacement of external Na by Li or choline has little effect on the synaptosome fluorescence. In quantitative terms, synaptosome fluorescence is proportional to log ([K]o plus 0-05[Na]o). Rb is about as effective as K in enhancing synaptosome fluorescence; Cs is about 1/4 as effective. The effect of increased [K]o is reversible. 6. The fluorescence data provide corroborative evidence that there is normally a large K gradient ([K]o smaller than [I]i) across the synaptosome surface membrane. The data suggest the [K]i may be in excess of 100 mM. 7. Replacement of Cl- by methylsulphate did not significantly affect the relationship between synaptosome fluorescence and [K]o, nor did removal of external Ca. 8. The fluorescence of CC5-treated mitochondria, membrane fragmnets, or lysed synaptosomes is unaffected by changes in the K concentration of the medium. 9. Veratridine and gramicidin D, both of which enhance Na permeability (PNa) in some intact tissues, increase synaptosome fluorescence when added to the standard medium. The increment is greatly reduced or abolished when external Na is replaced by choline. 10. If synaptosomes are first Na-loaded (by pre-treatment with cyanide + iodoacetate), and then placed in a choline medium, addition of gramicidin D significantly decreases fluorescence. This effect could be explained if, with [Na]o smaller than [Na]i, the increase in PNa causes the synaptosomes to hyperpolarize. 11. The veratridine-induced increase in synaptosome fluorescence was prevented by 3 times 10- minus 7M tetrodotoxin, which also blocks the depolarizing effect of veratridine in intact neurones. 12. The main conclusion is that synaptosomes may retain resting membrane potentials and the ability to increase Na permeability.

1. The method is based on the observation that choline esters and sodium tetraphenylboron (Kalignost) form complexes that are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as nitriles, higher ketones and benzyl alcohol. 2. The extraction procedure is an example of liquid cation exchange where tetraphenylboron is the cation-exchange group. 3. The proportion of choline esters extracted depends on the type and total amount of cation in the aqueous phase and the amount of sodium tetraphenylboron in the organic solvent. 4. The proportion of choline esters extracted is independent of the choline ester concentration, the pH (between 8 and 3) and the relative volumes of the two phases. 5. The affinity of sodium tetraphenylboron for choline esters increases with an increase in the size of the acyl group. 6. The choline ester extracted can be released into an aqueous solution by treatment with strong acids, silver salts and anion-exchange resins.

The relation between pyruvate utilization and acetylcholine synthesis was investigated in minces of adult rat brain. The flux of pyruvate to acetylcholine was less than 1% of that to CO2; nevertheless, a number of agents which inhibited conversion of [1-14C]-pyruvate or [2-14C]pyruvate into 14CO2 were associated with corresponding decreases in the conversion of [2-14C]pyruvate into acetylcholine. The amount of acetylcholine produced by minces of whole rat brain, measured by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry, decreased similarly. Among the inhibitory compounds tested were 3-bromopyruvate, an irreversible inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase; 2-oxobutyrate, a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase; other 2-oxo acids; and amobarbital and pentobarbital. Linear-regression equations relating CO2 production to acetylcholine synthesis gave correlation coefficients of 0.89-0.93 for the combined observations. The inhibition of acetylcholine synthesis could not be attributed to inhibition of choline acetyltransferase. Incorporation of [2-14C]pyruvate into lipids, proteins and nucleic acids was effected less than that into acetylcholine. Under these experimental conditions, it was shown that pyruvate utilization can limit acetylcholine synthesis.

1. Studies of the synthesis and release of radioactive acetylcholine in rat brain-cortex slices incubated in Locke–bicarbonate–[U-14C]glucose media, containing paraoxon as cholinesterase inhibitor, revealed the following phenomena: (a) dependence of K+-or protoveratrine-stimulated acetylcholine synthesis and release on the presence of Na+ and Ca2+ in the incubation medium, (b) enhanced release of radioactive acetylcholine by substances that promote depolarization at the nerve cell membrane (e.g. high K+, ouabain, protoveratrine, sodium l-glutamate, high concentration of acetylcholine), (c) failure of acetylcholine synthesis to keep pace with acetylcholine release under certain conditions (e.g. the presence of ouabain or lack of Na+). 2. Stimulation by K+ of radioactive acetylcholine synthesis was directly proportional to the external concentration of Na+, but some synthesis and release of radioactive acetylcholine occurred in the absence of Na+ as well as in the absence of Ca2+. 3. The Na+ dependence of K+-stimulated acetylcholine synthesis was partly due to suppression of choline transport, as addition of small concentrations of choline partly neutralized the effect of Na+ lack, and partly due to the suppression of the activity of the Na+ pump. 4. Protoveratrine caused a greatly increased release of radioactive acetylcholine without stimulating total radioactive acetylcholine synthesis. Protoveratrine was ineffective in the absence of Ca2+ from the incubation medium. It completely blocked K+ stimulation of acetylcholine synthesis and release. 5. Tetrodotoxin abolished the effects of protoveratrine on acetylcholine release. It had blocking effects (partial or complete) on the action of high K+, sodium l-glutamate and lack of Ca2+ on acetylcholine synthesis and release. 6. Unlabelled exogenous acetylcholine did not diminish the content of labelled tissue acetylcholine, derived from labelled glucose, suggesting that no exchange with vesicular acetylcholine took place. In the presence of 4mm-KCl it caused some increase in the release of labelled acetylcholine. 7. The barbiturates (Amytal, pentothal), whilst having no significant effects on labelled acetylcholine synthesis in unstimulated brain except at high concentration (1mm), diminished or abolished (at 0.25 or 0.5mm) the enhanced release of acetylcholine, due to high K+ or lack of Ca2+. The fall in tissue content of acetylcholine, due to lack of Ca2+, was diminished or abolished by pentothal (0.25 or 0.5mm) or Amytal (0.25mm).

Experiments were performed to determine the specificity of [125I]α-bungarotoxin binding to skeletal muscle. In adult rat diaphragm, [125I]α-bungarotoxin was found to bind almost exclusively to those regions of the muscle that contain endplates and are known to be sensitive to acetylcholine. In contrast, chronically denervated adult muscle and muscle from neonatal rats, both of which are sensitive along their entire lengths, bound substantial amounts of toxin in all regions. Toxin binding to all muscles was inhibited by d-tubocurarine and by carbamylcholine, but not by atropine. The bound [125I]toxin was solubilized by homogenization of the tissue in 1% Triton X-100 and was recovered as a single band, distinct from free toxin, after zone sedimentation. Treatment of the solubilized, toxin-bound complex with 2-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in the recovery of free toxin. A toxin-bound complex was also obtained when toxin was incubated directly with extracts of muscle endplate regions prepared by homogenization in Triton X-100. No such complex was observed with extracts prepared from muscle lacking endplates. These results are consistent with the interpretation that α-bungarotoxin binds specifically to the acetylcholine receptor of mammalian skeletal muscle.

Using 125iodine-labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT-125I) and quantitative radioautography, we have studied the time-course of the change in acetylcholine (ACh) receptor distribution and density occurring in rat diaphragm after denervation. In innervated fibers, ACh receptors are localized at the neuromuscular junction and the extrajunctional receptor density is less than five receptors per square micrometer. The extrajunctional receptor density begins to increase between 2 and 3 days after denervation and increases approximately linearly to 1695 receptors/µm2 at 14 days, subsequently decreasing to 529 receptors/µm2 at 45 days. We have isolated plasma membranes from rat leg muscles at various times after denervation and find that the change in concentration of ACh receptors in the membranes measured by α-BGT-125I binding and scintillation counting follows a time-course similar to the change in ACh receptor density measured radioautographically. Furthermore, we have correlated extrajunctional ACh receptor density measured by radioautography with extrajunctional ACh sensitivity measured by iontophoretic application of ACh and intracellular recording and find that the log of ACh receptor density is related to 0.53 times the log of ACh sensitivity. These results are discussed in terms of the electrophysiological experiments on the ACh receptor and the recent, more biochemical approaches to the study of ACh receptor control and function.

[3H]Strychnine binds to synaptic-membrane fractions of the spinal cord in a selective fashion, indicating an interaction with postsynaptic glycine receptors. Displacement of strychnine by glycine and other amino acids parallels their glycine-like neurophysiologic activity. The regional localization of strychnine binding in the central nervous system correlates closely with endogenous glycine concentrations. In subcellular fractionation experiments, strychnine binding is most enhanced in synaptic-membrane fractions. Strychnine binding is saturable, with affinity constants for glycine and strychnine of 10 and 0.03 μM, respectively.

1. The binding of non-occluded choline acetyltransferase to synaptosome membranes is a reversible process that is primarily dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the suspending medium. 2. The distribution of soluble enzyme bound to synaptosome membranes was studied by density-gradient centrifuging. 3. Choline acetyltransferase shows enzyme activity both in the free and in the membrane-bound form. 4. Varying the temperature or prolonged hypo-osmotic treatment does not release the membrane-bound enzyme. 5.

1. In the lung and liver of tocopherol-deficient rats, the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were increased substantially, suggesting an important role for both enzymes in protecting the organ against the deleterious effects of lipid peroxides. 2. Facilitation of the glutathione peroxidase reaction by infusing t-butyl hydroperoxide caused the oxidation of nicotinamide nucleotides and glutathione, resulting in a concomitant increase in the rate of release of oxidized glutathione into the perfusate. Thus the rate of production of lipid peroxide and H2O2 in the perfused organ could be compared by simultaneous measurement of the rate of glutathione release and the turnover number of the catalase reaction. 3. On hyperbaric oxygenation at 4 X 10(5)Pa, H2O2 production, estimated from the turnover of the catalase reaction, was increased slightly in the liver, and glutathione release was increased slightly, in both lung and liver. 4. Tocopherol deficiency caused a marked increase in lipid-peroxide formation as indicated by a corresponding increase in glutathione release under hyperbaric oxygenation, with a further enhancement when the tocopherol-deficient rats were also starved. 5. The study demonstrates that the primary response to hyperbaric oxygenation is an elevation of the rate of lipid peroxidation rather than of the rate of formation of H2O2 or superoxide.

"The properties of H2O2 production in the ""haemoglobin-free"", ""non-circulatory"" perfused liver of rats were examined. The H2O2 production with 1 mM-lactate and 0.15 mM-pyruvate was 82nmol/min per g of liver or 333nmol/min per 100g body wt. in the liver of fed rats at 30 degrees C. This rate decreased to almost half in the livers of starved and phenobarbital-pretreated rats. When H2O2 production was stimulated by urate infusion, almost all of the H2O2 produced by the uricase reaction was decomposed by the catalase reaction. During the demethylation reaction of aminopyrine, no change in H2O2 production was detected by the present method; thus microsomal H2O2 production observed in isolated subcellular fractions appeared not to contribute significantly to the H2O2 production in the whole organ. Whereas the rate of the glycolate-dependent H2O2 production was halved at an intracellular O2 concentration that caused a 10 percent increase in the reduction state of cytochrome c, the half-maximal rate of H2O2 production with lactate and pyruvate was observed at an O2 concentration that caused a 40 percent increase in the reduction state of cytochrome c in the liver. No further increase in the rates of H2O2 production was obtained by increasing O2 pressure up to 5 times 10(5) Pa. The rate of ethanol oxidation through the catalase ""peroxidatic"" reaction varied, depending on the substrate availability. The maximal capability of this pathway in ethanol oxidation reached approx. 1.5 mumol/min per g of liver, when a mixture of urate, glycollate and octanoate was infused to enhance H2O2 production."

A new technique employing continuous recirculating perfusion of the rat liver in situ, shaking of the liver in buffer in vitro, and filtration of the tissue through nylon mesh, results in the conversion of about 50% of the liver into intact, isolated parenchymal cells. The perfusion media consist of: (a) calcium-free Hanks' solution containing 0.05% collagenase and 0.10% hyaluronidase, and (b) magnesium and calcium-free Hanks' solution containing 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Biochemical and morphologic studies indicate that the isolated cells are viable. They respire in a medium containing calcium ions, synthesize glucose from lactate, are impermeable to inulin, do not stain with trypan blue, and retain their structural integrity. Electron microscopy of biopsies taken during and after perfusion reveals that desmosomes are quickly cleaved. Hemidesmosome-containing areas of the cell membrane invaginate and appear to pinch off and migrate centrally. Tight and gap junctions, however, persist on the intact, isolated cells, retaining small segments of cytoplasm from formerly apposing parenchymal cells. Cells which do not retain tight and gap junctions display swelling of Golgi vacuoles and vacuoles in the peripheral cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic vacuolization in a small percentage of cells and potassium loss are the only indications of cell injury detected. By other parameters measured, the isolated cells are comparable to normal hepatic parenchymal cells in situ in appearance and function.

The two morphologically different constituents of the mature elastic fiber, the central amorphous and the peripheral microfibrillar components, have been separated and partially characterized. A pure preparation of elastic fibers was obtained from fetal bovine ligamentum nuchae by extraction of the homogenized ligament with 5 M guanidine followed by digestion with collagenase. The resultant preparation consisted of elastic fibers which were morphologically identical with those seen in vivo. The microfibrillar components of these elastic fibers were removed either by proteolytic enzymes or by reduction of disulfide bonds with dithioerythritol in 5 M guanidine. The microfibrils solubilized by both methods were rich in polar, hydroxy, and sulfur-containing amino acids and contained less glycine, valine, and proline than the amorphous component of the elastic fiber. In contrast, the amino acid composition of the amorphous component was identical with that previously described for elastin. This component demonstrated selective susceptibility to elastase digestion, but was relatively resistant to the action of other proteolytic enzymes and to reduction. These observations establish that the microfibrils consist of a different connective tissue protein (or proteins) that is neither collagen nor elastin. During embryologic development the microfibrils form an aggregate structure before the amorphous component is secreted. These microfibrils may therefore play a primary role in the morphogenesis of the elastic fiber.	THE ELASTIC FIBER I.

These studies have examined the ability of smooth muscle cells from developing aorta of the prepubertal rat to utilize amino acids in the synthesis and secretion of connective tissue proteins. Prepubertal rats, previously given either an alcohol carrier or estradiol-17-beta, were each given an intravenous injection of proline-3H. The animals were sacrificed after 15 and 30 min, and 4 hr. Light and electron microscope radioautographs of the aortic smooth muscle and of the myometrial cells demonstrated that the aortic cells, in both groups of animals, and the myometrial cells, in the estrogen-stimulated animals, took up the proline and rapidly secreted it in both collagen and elastic fibers within 4 hr. In contrast, the myometrial cells of the nonstimulated animal took up relatively small amounts of proline and retained most of the amino acid within the cells. Electron microscope radioautographs demonstrated that the organelles involved in this activity were the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex together with peripheral elements, presumed to be small vesicles. These studies have demonstrated that the smooth muscle cells of the developing aorta and of the estrogen-stimulated myometrium have a capacity to synthesize and secrete proteins associated with the extracellular connective tissue matrix.

Phagocytes of the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) contain no endogenous peroxidase within their lysosomes and constitute models for cells genetically deficient in lysosomal enzymes such as myeloperoxidase. We have obtained uptake of over 50% of exogenous horseradish peroxidase, provided the enzyme is exhibited to cells after incorporation into liposomes coated with heat-aggregated (62 degrees, 10 min), isologous IgM. Trapping of horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) by liposomes was established by chromatographic resolution (Sephadex G-200; Sepharose 2B and 4B) of free enzyme from that associated with liposomes; liposome-associated horseradish peroxidase, together with trapped markers of the aqueous compartment (glucose, CrO4 equals), were excluded, and free enzyme and markers were retained. Enzyme and marker trapping was not electrostatic, varied with the molar ratio of charged membrane components, and was reversed by detergent lysis (Triton X-100) of liposomes. Uptake at 30 degrees of aggregated IgM-coated liposomes containing trapped horseradish peroxidase exceeded that of free enzyme of 100-fold, and was more efficient than uptake of horseradish peroxidase presented in uncoated liposomes or in liposomes coated with native IgM. After phagocytosis, peroxidase-rich liposomes were localized exclusively in lysosomes of the phagocytes by ultrastructural histochemistry; the enzyme displayed over 50% latency to osmotic lysis. This method may prove to be of general use in the provision of exogenous enzymes to phagocytic cells genetically deficient in lysosomal hydrolases.Images	A general method for the introduction of enzymes, by means of immunoglobulin-coated liposomes, into lysosomes of deficient cells.

Selective radioactive labeling of the cholesteryl esters contained within human plasma low density lipoprotein has allowed the study of the metabolism of these molecules in monolayers and extracts of cultured human fibroblasts. In monolayers of normal cells, binding of low density lipoprotein to its cell surface receptor was followed by rapid hydrolysis of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate contained within the lipoprotein and accumulation of the liberated [3H]cholesterol within the cell. The stoichiometry of the degradative process suggested that the protein and cholesteryl ester components of the lipoprotein were hydrolyzed in parallel. Incubation of intact fibroblasts with chloroquine, a known inhibitor of lysosomal degradative processes, inhibited the hydrolysis of the lipoprotein-bound cholesteryl esters. Fibroblasts from subjects with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia, which lack functional low density lipoprotein receptors and thus are unable to take up this lipoprotein when it is present in the culture medium at low concentrations, were therefore unable to hydrolyze the lipoprotein-bound [3H]cholesteryl linoleate. However, cell-free extracts from these mutant cells were capable of hydrolyzing the lipoprotein-bound [3H]cholesteryl linoleate at the same rapid rate as normal cells when incubated at acid pH. These data illustrate the essential role of the low density lipoprotein receptor and of lysosomal acid hydrolases in the metabolic utilization of low density lipoproteins by cultured human fibroblasts.

A hitherto unknown rod-shaped cytoplasmic component which consists of a bundle of fine tubules, enveloped by a tightly fitted membrane, was regularly found in endothelial cells of small arteries in various organs in rat and man. It is about 0.1 µ thick, measures up to 3 µ in length, and contains several small tubules, ∼150 A thick, embedded in a dense matrix, and disposed parallel to the long axis of the rod. In some of these cells, the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum are greatly distended by the accumulation of a dense, finely granular material. The nature and significance of these cytoplasmic components are yet unknown.	NEW CYTOPLASMIC COMPONENTS IN ARTERIAL ENDOTHELIA	Ewald R. Weibel, George E. Palade	14228505	1964-10-01	10	
A method for the culture of rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro is described, in which pinocytic uptake of colloidal [198 Au]gold, 125I--labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and [14C]sucrose proceeds at contant and fairly reproducible rates for several hours. The rat of uptake of colloidal [198 Au]gold, which wxhibited some inter-batch variation, was approx. 100 times that of the other two substrates. Colloidal gold did not affect the rate of uptake of 125I-labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and therefore its own high rate of uptake could not be attributed to a stimulation of the formation of pinocytic vesicles. It conclude that uptake of collodial gold is highly dependent on adsorption on binding sites on the plasma membrane. Uptake of formaldehyde-treated 125I-labelled bovine serum albumin was followed by the release of [125I]iodo-L-tyrosine into the culture medium and took place at a rate intermediate between those of collodial [198Au]gold and the other two non-digestible substrates, 125I-labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and [14C]sucrose.

Portions of a 125I-iodinated bovine serum albumin preparation were exposed to freezing, acetic acid (pH 3.5, 3.0 or 2.5), urea or formaldehyde, and the effect of these treatments on the rates of pinocytic uptake by yolk sacs from 17.5-day-pregnant rats cultured in vitro and of clearance from the rat bloodstream were studied. Uptake of albumin by the yolk sac was followed by rapid release of [125I]iodo-L-tyrosine into the culture medium. Similarly clearance of albumin in vivo was accompanied by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the bloodstream. In both systems the rates of uptake of modified albumin preparations formed a series: formaldehyde or urea greater than acetic acid greater than freezing. The increased rates of uptake of modified albumin preparations could not be ascribed to the formation of aggregates nor, in the yolk-sac system, to an increase in the rate of pinosome formation. It is concluded that the various treatments to which the albumin was subjected increase to varying degrees the affinity of the albumin molecule for binding sites on that region of the plasma membrane from which pinocytic vesicles are formed. Some comparable experiments with native and desialylated human orosomucoid indicate that the rat yolk-sac epithelial cells do not possess the recognition system for uptake of asialoglycoproteins that exists on the surface of hepatic parenchymal cells.

Phagocytosis of cholesterol-containing particles resulted in the formation of an intralysosomal cholesterol compartment. Cholesterol was excreted out of the macrophage with a single exponential rate which depended on the concentration of acceptor lipoproteins in the medium. Exchange kinetics performed on cells which had ingested particulate cholesterol suggested that excretion occurred by the same mechanism as exchange. Cholesterol esters as particulate albumin coacervates were taken up by macrophages and hydrolyzed by a lysosomal cholesterol esterase with optimal activity at pH 4.0. Cholesteryl linoleate was hydrolyzed much more readily than cholesteryl palmitate. The amount of cholesterol esterase and its specific activity increased during the in vitro cultivation of macrophages. Intralysosomally, cholesteryl linoleate and palmitate were hydrolyzed to free cholesterol which was excreted from the macrophage and recovered in the medium. Since cholesteryl linoleate was hydrolyzed more rapidly than free cholesterol was excreted into the medium, free cholesterol accumulated intralysosomally. Cholesteryl palmitate was hydrolyzed more slowly, and the rate of hydrolysis was limiting for excretion of the free cholesterol from within the lysosome.	CHOLESTEROL METABOLISM IN THE MACROPHAGE III.

The turnover of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) and the total body balance of cholestrol were studied in a 6-yr-old girl with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) before and after the surgical creation of an end-to-side portacaval shunt. The results were compared with those of similar studies simultaneously performed in untreated patients with the heterozygous form of FH and with the results of earlier studies performed on normolipidemic subjects. Before shunt surgery, the rate of synthesis of LDL in the FH homozygote (mg/kg per day) was fourfold higher than in normolipidemic subjects and twofold higher than in her heterozygous mother. The fractional catabolic rate for LDL in the homozygote was decreased to 33% of normal control values. The rate of cholesterol synthesis, estimated by chemical sterol balance, was higher in the FH homozygote than in two FH heterozygotes of similar age studied simultaneously. When considered in relation to the markedly elevated level of plasma cholesterol, the observed rate of cholesterol synthesis in the FH homozygote was inappropriately elevated. Bile acid production was normal in all three children. 5 mo after shunt surgery, the rate of LDL synthesis in the homozygote had declined by 48% as compared with the preoperative value, and this caused a 39% drop in the plasma LDL cholesterol level despite a 17% reduction in the fractional catabolic rate of the lipoprotein. The rate of cholesterol synthesis fell by 62% as compared with the preoperative value. The findings of an inappropriately elevated rate of production of both cholesterol and LDL as well as a reduced fractional catabolic rate for the lipoprotein in the untreated FH homozygote are consistent with results of studies in cultured fibroblasts indicating that the primary genetic defect in FH involves a deficiency in a cell-surface receptor for LDL that regulates both cholesterol synthesis and LDL degradation. Although the mechanism for the decline in production of cholesterol and LDL after portacaval shunt surgery is unknown, it was observed that these changes were associated with marked increases in the plasma concentrations of bile acids and glucagon.

Dogs maintained for 1 year on a semisynthetic diet containing hydrogenated coconut oil and cholesterol developed hypercholesterolemia. In those cases where plasma cholesterol levels exceeded 750 mg/100 ml, the animals also developed severe atherosclerosis. This atherogenic hyperlipoproteinemia was characterized by the presence of beta very low density lipoproteins (B-VLDL), increased levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL), and the occurrence of the HDLc lipoproteins. In all of these cholesterol-rich lipoproteins the arginine-rich apoprotein (ARP) was prominent. Moreover, the HDLc (d = 1.006-1.02) contained the ARP as the only detectable apoprotein. The atherosclerosis involved the abdominal aorta, coronary and cerebrovascular arteries, and many of the peripheral arteries. Histologically, the aortic lesions were characterized by a variable intimal proliferative response and extensive medial lipid deposition. In the peripheral, coronary, and cerebral arteries, the lesions were more extensive and involved primarily the media of the vessel wall, with little intimal reaction in many cases. The correlation between the in vivo disease process and the response of aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) grown in tissue culture to the various cholesterol-induced lipoproteins was examined. B-VLDL, LDL, and HDLc (but not HDL2) caused a marked accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol in the SMC. The cholesterol accumulation was found to be more extensive in canine SMC than in swine smooth muscle cells or smooth muscle cells of other species in response to a similar lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The enhanced sterol uptake appeared to be a property of canine smooth muscle cells rather than a property of the canine lipoproteins. These in vitro results may be related to the observed propensity for the development of medical disease that was demonstrated in the in vivo studies.ImagesFigure 6-8Figure 9Figure 10Figure 11Figure 12Figure 13Figure 14Figure 15Figure 1Figure 2Figure 3-5	Canine hyperlipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis.

Selective chemical modification of lysine residues of lipoproteins by acetoacetylation dramatically altered the metabolism of the lipoproteins without significantly altering other physical or chemical properties. Modification of 30-60% of the total lysine residues of iodinated rat or human low-density lipoproteins (125I-LDL) resulted in a rapid removal of these acetoacetylated lipoproteins from the plasma of rats. Within minutes after intravenous injection into intact rats, greater than 80% of the total injected dose disappeared from the plasma. The rapidly cleared acetoacetylated LDL appeared in the liver, and within 6-30 min as much as 50-80% of the total injected dose of modified LDL could be accounted for in the liver. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate in the isolated perfused rat liver that the Kupffer cells were responsible for the lipoprotein uptake. Human high-density lipoproteins (HDL3) were also rapidly removed from the plasma after acetoacetylation. In striking contrast, acetoacetylation (30-60%) of two E apoprotein-containing lipoproteins (rat HDL1 and dog HDLc) retarded their removal from the plasma. The accelerated removal of modified LDL and HDL3, in contrast to the retarded removal of modified HDL1 and HDLc, suggests that the recognition and removal process is specific for a property acquired by only certain lipoproteins after acetoacetylation. Moreover, these results suggest that lysine residues of the E apoprotein may play a functional role in the recognition process for the normal clearance of HDL1 and HDLc, a process that is interfered with after acetoacetylation.Images	Accelerated clearance of low-density and high-density lipoproteins and retarded clearance of E apoprotein-containing lipoproteins from the plasma of rats after modification of lysine residues	Robert W.

"Guinea pig vascular endothelial cells contain naturally occurring rings of intermediate filaments that completely encircle the nucleus. Indirect immunofluorescence staining showed that these perinuclear rings bound antibody prepared against protein from bovine brain 9-nm filaments. In endothelial cells grown in the presence of 1 muM demecolcine (Colcemid) the perinuclear ring ""coils"" into a juxtanuclear ""cap"". Throughout this process we could demonstrate staining of the intermediate filaments. Chick cardiac muscle cells in culture stained diffusely with the antibody. After treatment for 24 hr with 1 muM demecolcine the cardiac cells accumulated large bands of intermediate filaments. These bands stained intensely with the antibody. Our findings suggest that intermediate filaments in guinea pig endothelial cells and those induced in chick cardiac muscle cells are antigenically similar to bovine brain filaments. The staining of these filaments is not affected by treatment with demecolcine.Images"	Localization of bovine brain filament antibody on intermediate (100 A) filaments in guinea pig vascular endothelial cells and chick cardiac muscle cells.

To study the various stages of human mononuclear phagocyte maturation, we cultivated bone marrow in an in vitro diffusion chamber with the cells growing in suspension and upon a dialysis membrane. At 2, 7, and 14 days, the cultured cells were examined by electron microscopy and cytochemical techniques for peroxidase and for more limited analysis of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase. Peroxidase was being synthesized in promonocytes of 2- and 7-day cultures, as evidenced by reaction product in the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and storage granules. Peroxidase synthesis had ceased in monocytes and the enzyme appeared only in some granules. By 7 days, large macrophages predominated, containing numerous peroxidase-positive storage granules, and heterophagy of dying cells was evident. By 14 days, the most prevalent cell type was the large peroxidase-negative macrophage. Thus, peroxidase is present in high concentrations in immature cells but absent at later stages, presumably a result of degranulation of peroxidase-positive storage granules. Clusters of peroxidase-negative macrophages with indistinct borders (epithelioid cells), as well as obvious multinucleated giant cells, were noted. Frequently, the interdigitating plasma membranes of neighboring macrophages showed a modification resembling a septate junction--to our knowledge, representing the first documentation of this specialized cell contact between normal macrophages. We suggest that such junctions may serve as zones of adhesion between epithelioid cells.Images	Differentiation of macrophages from normal human bone marrow in liquid culture.

Hypercholesterolemia was induced in pigs by feeding a chow diet supplemented with 1.5% cholesterol and 19.5% lard for periods up to 12 weeks. The aortic intima from areas of spontaneously differing permeability to proteins, as demarcated by their uptake of Evans blue dye, was examined using light microscopy and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy to describe the earliest detectable changes in intimal morphology induced by the diet. After 2, 4, and 6 weeks of feeding, cholesterol/lardfed pigs demonstrated monocyte adherence to the endothelium in areas of enhanced permeability (blue areas) in 86% of samples examined, as compared to 52% in areas of lesser permeability (white areas) and 17% in control animals. Similarly, the number of monocytes in the intima was higher in blue areas than in adjacent white areas or blue areas from control animals. After 12 weeks of feeding, all blue areas showed intimal monocytes, with fewer seen in white areas. Aortic endothelial cells in hypercholesterolemic pigs were normal in ultrastructural appearance, except they contained more lysosomes and cytoplasmic filaments than those from control animals. No lesions were observed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, although plasma cholesterol levels were substantially elevated (200-400 mg/dl) at these times. A marked hyper-β-lipoproteinemia was evident from 4 weeks onward, but no elevation of serum triglycerides was evident at any stage. Plasma phospholipid concentrations increased but not in direct proportion to cholesterol levels. At 12 weeks, foam cell lesions were observed in areas of enhanced permeability but not in adjacent areas of normal permeability. Lesion foam cells appeared to be derived from the monocytes which adhered to and penetrated the endothelium at earlier stages, since no intimal involvement, or lipid engorgement, by medial smooth muscle cells was observed.ImagesFigure 2Figure 3Figure 1Figure 8Figure 9Figure 10Figure 11Figure 12Figure 13Figure 4Figure 5Figure 6Figure 7	Dietary Induced Atherogenesis in SwineMorphology of the Intima in Prelesion Stages	Ross G.

"1. The inactivation of cytosol enzymes in liver extracts was carried out by several subcellular fractions, with plasma membranes having the highest specific activity. Rough and smooth microsomal fractions were both active, whereas lysosmal inactivation capacity appeared to be derived entirely from contaminating plasma-membrane fragments. 2. Inactivation capacity in liver fractions was derived from parenchymal cells. Of the non-liver cells tested, plasma membranes from H35 hepatoma cells were able to inactivate glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), adipocyte ""ghosts"" showed slight activity and erythrocyte and reticulocyte ""ghosts"" were inactive. 3. Liposomes prepared from pure lipids with net negative, positive or neutral charge did not possess inactivation capacity. 4. Liver plasma-membrane inactivation capacity was destroyed by heating at 50 degrees C. 5. Inactivation factor solubilized from membranes by trypsin plus Triton X-100 treatment was partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite chromatography. 6. Partially purified inactivation factor analysed by gel electrophoresis gave a major protein band that co-migrated with capacity for inactivation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. 7. It is concluded that inactivation factor is a membrane protein whose intracellular distribution and other properties are consistent with a possible role for this activity in the initial step of protein degradation.ImagesFig. 5."

During metabolism of (type I) drugs by cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase of the endoplasmic reticulum, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio in rat liver selectively decreases to approximately one-half of the control values, whereas the NADH/NAD+ ratio remains practically unaffected [Sies, H. & Brauser, B. (1970) Eur. J. Biochem. 15, 521-540]. In view of the observations with isolated mitochondria [Lehninger, A. L., Vercesi, A. & Bababunmi, E. A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 1690-1694] of stimulated Ca2+ efflux upon nicotinamide nucleotide oxidation, the selective oxidation of NADPH in cytosol and mitochondria during drug oxidations was considered a useful experimental tool for the determination of whether the oxidation of NADPH or of NADH is responsible for Ca2+ efflux. With perfused livers from phenobarbital-treated rats, Ca2+ efflux was demonstrated, amounting to 8 nmol/min per gram of liver (wet weight), with aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, or hexobarbital as drug substrates. Drug-associated Ca2+ release was diminished when the inhibitor metyrapone was also present, or when drug oxidation was suppressed during N2 anoxia or in the presence of antimycin A in livers from fasted rats. Ca2+ efflux was elicited also by infusion of the thiol oxidant diamide, and by t-butyl hydroperoxide. However whereas Ca2+ efflux elicited by these compounds was restricted upon addition of the thiol dithioerythritol, there was little, if any, sensitivity of the drug-associated Ca2+ efflux to the thiol. Further mitochondrial oxidation of NADPH by addition of ammonium chloride had no effect on drug-associated Ca2+ efflux. Prior addition of the alpha-agonist phenylephrine suppressed the Ca2+ release by drug addition. While the molecular mechanism involved in Ca2+ efflux from liver mitochondria and from hepatocytes as well as the regulatory significance are not yet known, it is concluded from the present experiments that in case of nicotinamide nucleotide-linked Ca2+ efflux the oxidation of NADPH may suffice, with oxidation of NADH not being a requirement.

1. Administration of ethanol (14g/day per kg) for 21–26 days to rats increases the ability of the animals to metabolize ethanol, without concomitant changes in the activities of liver alcohol dehydrogenase or catalase. 2. Liver slices from rats chronically treated with ethanol showed a significant increase (40–60%) in the rate of O2 consumption over that of slices from control animals. The effect of uncoupling agents such as dinitrophenol and arsenate was completely lost after chronic treatment with ethanol. 3. Isolated mitochondria prepared from animals chronically treated with ethanol showed no changes in state 3 or state 4 respiration, ADP/O ratio, respiratory control ratio or in the dinitrophenol effect when succinate was used as substrate. With β-hydroxybutyrate as substrate a small but statistically significant decrease was found in the ADP/O ratio but not in the other parameters or in the dinitrophenol effect. Further, no changes in mitochondrial Mg2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase, dinitrophenol-activated adenosine triphosphatase or in the dinitrophenol-activated adenosine triphosphatase/Mg2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase ratio were found as a result of the chronic ethanol treatment. 4. Liver microsomal NADPH oxidase activity, a H2O2-producing system, was increased by 80–100% by chronic ethanol treatment. Oxidation of formate to CO2 in vivo was also increased in these animals. The increase in formate metabolism could theoretically be accounted for by an increased production of H2O2 by the NADPH oxidase system plus formate peroxidation by catalase. However, an increased production of H2O2 and oxidation of ethanol by the catalase system could not account for more than 10–20% of the increased ethanol metabolism in the animals chronically treated with ethanol. 5. Results presented indicate that chronic ethanol ingestion results in a faster mitochondrial O2 consumption in situ suggesting a faster NADH reoxidation. Although only a minor change in mitochondrial coupling was observed with isolated mitochondria, the possibility of an uncoupling in the intact cell cannot be completely discarded. Regardless of the mechanism, these changes could lead to an increased metabolism of ethanol and of other endogenous substrates.

The concentrations of the components of the respiratory chain were determined in a variety of intact skeletal muscles by a method of spectrophotometric observation of the transmitted light. In the case of the toad sartorius, these measurements were checked against isolated mitochondrial suspensions prepared from toad skeletal muscles. The relative concentrations of the respiratory components were found to be in reasonable agreement with those of various mitochondrial preparations of mammalian tissues and of the ones from toad skeletal muscle. The rather low cytochrome b and pyridine nucleotide levels in the anoxic minus oxygenated difference spectra were shown to be caused to a certain degree by a partial reduction during the resting steady state. Upon treatment with a strong, reducing agent or after long anoxia some absorption bands appeared with maxima at 591, 562 to 564, and 432 to 434 mµ both in the intact and in the mitochondrial fractions of muscle tissue; they do not appear to be associated with the respiratory chain.

1. A method was developed for the assay of GSSG in heart tissue. 2. GSSG and total glutathione were measured in rat hearts perfused under a variety of conditions. About 2% of the total glutathione is present as GSSG. The concentrations of GSSG and GSH remained constant under all the conditions tested. 3. These results are discussed with reference to the equilibrium and rate of the glutathione reductase reaction in the cell. It is concluded that the enzyme reaction does not lie near equilibrium.

1. The mechanisms that control the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate cycle in mussel hepatopancreas were investigated. 2. The effects of GSSG (oxidized glutathione) on the inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by NADPH [Eggleston & Krebs (1974) Biochem. J. 138, 425-435] extend to 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. 3. The effect of GSSG on both enzymes increases as the [NADP+1]/[NADPH] ratio decreases; greater percentage deinhibition always was obtained for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. 4. Increasing concentration of GSSG increased the percentage deinhibition. This effect is more pronounced with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. 5. We confirmed the apparent imbalance between the activities of the two enzymes [sapag-Hagar, Lagunas & Sols (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun, 50, 179-185] in the presence of 10mM-Mg2+. 6. The imbalance practically disappears when the substrate concentrations are less than saturating and Mg2+ approaches physiological concentrations. 7.

Experiments were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of the reversal of NADPH inhibition of rat liver glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by oxidized gluthathione alone and in combination with a putative cofactor described by Eggleston & Krebs [(1974) Biochem. J. 138, 425-435]. Evidence is presented that this reversal is largely an artifact, caused by the incorrect application of a control assay procedure and a spurious effect of Zn2+ (added in order to inhibit glutathione reductase) in crude enzyme solutions. When the proper assay procedure is used and glutathione reductase is inhibited with low concentrations of Hg2+, glutathione addition has no effect on NADPH inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. No evidence was found for the existence of a cofactor that mediates an effect of glutathione on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

We have studied in detail the binding of fluorescent derivatives of insulin and epidermal growth factor to 3T3 fibroblasts. We have used two types of fluorescent analogues of insulin and epidermal growth factor: highly fluorescent derivatives which have seven to eight rhodamine molecules or fluorescent derivatives which have a single rhodamine molecule per one molecule of insulin or epidermal growth factor. Both types of analogue retained substantial binding affinity as determined by radioreceptor assays and biological activity. The cells labeled with the fluorescent analogues were visualized with a sensitive video intensification microscopic system that enabled us to directly observe the location of the fluorescent hormone on the surface and within the living fibroblasts. We found that both insulin and epidermal growth factor initially bound diffusely to the cell surface and, at 4°, remained dispersed. Within a few minutes at 23° or 37° the hormone-receptor complexes aggregated into patches that could be readily removed by trypsin but not by excess native hormone. The hormone-receptor complexes, which were initially mobile in the plane of the membrane, become immobilized later as the consequence of the receptor aggregation or internalization. Within ∼30 min at 37°, much of the labeled hormone was found within the cell in endocytic vesicles that moved about in the cytoplasm in a saltatory manner. The aggregation and immobilization of the hormone-receptor complexes could be due to either hormone-hormone interactions on the cell membrane or a hormone-induced conformational change in the hormone-receptor complex. Aggregation and internalization of hormone-receptor complexes could be associated with certain aspects of hormone action, hormone degradation, down regulation of receptors, or negative cooperativity of hormone binding.Images	Direct visualization of binding, aggregation, and internalization of insulin and epidermal growth factor on living fibroblastic cells	Joseph Schlessinger, Yoram Shechter, Mark C.

Binding of 125I-labeled insulin to rat liver and adipocyte plasma membranes has been investigated after treatment of the membranes with agents that modify disulfide bonds or sulfhydryl groups. Dithiothreitol, a disulfide-reducing agent, produced a bimodal response in adipocyte plasma membranes with dose-dependent increases in binding occurring over the range of 0-1 mM dithiothreitol; 5 mM dithiothreitol produced decreased binding. Insulin binding reached its maximal increase at 1 mM and was 3 times control values. Scatchard analysis of the 1 mM dithiothreitol effect revealed a straight line plot indicative of one class of sites with a Ka of 1.0 x 10(8) M-1 which is intermediate between the two Kas obtained from the curvilinear Scatchard plot of control membranes. There was a 20-fold increase in the number of intermediate-affinity receptors compared to high-affinity receptors. The increased 125I-labeled insulin binding after dithiothreitol treatment was reversed by oxidized glutathione in a dose-dependent manner. Interposition of treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, an alkylating agent, prevented oxidized glutathione from reversing the dithiothreitol effect. Reduced glutathione produced the same effect as dithiothreitol. Liver plasma membranes treated with up to 1 mM dithiothreitol exhibited a maximum increase in insulin binding of 20% compared to control. Dithiothreitol at 5 mM decreased insulin binding below that of control membranes. The results indicate that the dithiothreitol effect on insulin binding to adipocyte plasma membranes is due to disruption of disulfide bonds, and that the structural organization of the insulin receptor on the plasma membranes is different for liver and for adipose tissue. The data imply that the insulin receptors on the plasma membrane of adipocytes possess at least two functionally distinct subclasses of disulfide bond but liver insulin receptors do not.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by receptor agonists is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a product of phospholipase C-mediated breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The present study employs inositol tris[32P]phosphate to demonstrate a specific receptor binding site in a microsomal fraction of rat liver.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a component of the phosphoinositide second-messenger system which mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Recently, an InsP3 receptor binding protein from rat cerebellar membranes was solubilized and purified to homogeneity. The potent inhibition by Ca2+ of [3H]InsP3 binding to the InsP3 receptor in cellular membranes is not apparent in the purified receptor. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of [3H]InsP3 binding in the crude homogenate (concn. giving 50% inhibition = 300 nM) can be restored by addition of solubilized cerebellar membranes to the purified receptor. In the present study, we further characterize the protein in solubilized membranes which confers Ca2+-sensitivity to the receptor, and which we term 'calmedin'. Calmedin appears to be a neutral membrane protein with an estimated Mr of 300,000 by gel filtration in the presence of Triton X-100. Calmedin confers a Ca2+-sensitivity to InsP3 receptor binding, which can be completely reversed by 10 min incubation with EDTA and therefore does not represent Ca2+-dependent proteinase action. Calmedin effects on the purified InsP3 receptor depend on Ca2+ binding to the calmedin, although Ca2+ also binds directly to the InsP3 receptor. The regional distribution of calmedin differs from that of the InsP3 receptor in the brain, suggesting that it also mediates other Ca2+-dependent functions. Calmedin activity in peripheral tissues is much lower than in brain.

In permeabilized hepatocytes, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 4,5-bisphosphate induced rapid release of Ca2+ from an ATP-dependent, non-mitochondrial vesicular pool, probably endoplasmic reticulum. The order of potency was inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate greater than inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate greater than inositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The Ca2+-releasing action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is not inhibited by high [Ca2+], nor is it dependent on [ATP] in the range of 50 microM-1.5 mM. These results suggest a role for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a second messenger in hormone-induced Ca2+ mobilisation, and that a specific receptor is involved in the Ca2+-release mechanism.

The calcium concentration, [Ca]i, in single rat peritoneal mast cells was measured by means of the new Ca indicator dye fura-2. Upon stimulation with antigen or compound 48/80, [Ca]i rose for seconds to values greater than 5 microM. These Ca transients did not depend on the presence of extracellular Ca, and they sometimes occurred spontaneously, especially in the presence of exogenous phosphatidylserine. Calcium transients did not necessarily lead to degranulation. Degranulation usually occurred during periods of somewhat elevated [Ca] (0.5-1 microM) following transients but was sometimes observed at [Ca]i less than or equal to 250 nM. We found no evidence that an antigen-induced Ca influx is required for degranulation.	Fast calcium transients in rat peritoneal mast cells are not sufficient to trigger exocytosis.

Bovine anterior-pituitary microsomal fractions exhibit high-affinity, saturable and reversible binding of inositol 1,4,5-[32P]trisphosphate; 50% of the labelled ligand is displaced by 3.5 nM-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. 0.5 microM-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and 10 microM-ATP. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces the release of Ca2+ from the microsomal vesicles (half-maximal effect at 290 nM), and its action is potentiated by inositol tetrakisphosphate (half-maximal effect at 4 microM).

The properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor sites in the anterior pituitary were evaluated by binding studies with InsP3 labeled with 32P to high specific radioactivity. Specific binding of Ins[32P]P3 was demonstrable in pituitary membrane preparations and was linearly proportional to the amount of membrane added over the range 0.5-2 mg of protein. Kinetic studies showed that specific InsP3 binding was half-maximal in about 40 sec and reached a plateau after 15 min at 0 degree C. Addition of 1 microM unlabeled InsP3 was followed by rapid dissociation of the bound ligand, according to a single exponential function with half-time of about 1 min. Scatchard analysis of the binding data was consistent with a single set of high-affinity sites with Kd of 1.1 +/- 0.4 nM and maximal binding capacity of 28 +/- 15 fmol/mg of protein (n = 6). The specificity of Ins[32P]P3 binding to these sites was illustrated by the much weaker affinity for structural analogs such as inositol 1-phosphate, phytic acid, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. To assess the functional relevance of the InsP3 binding sites, the Ca2+-releasing activity of InsP3 was measured in pituitary membrane preparations. In the presence of oligomycin (2.5 micrograms/ml), Ca2+ movements were monitored with the fluorescent indicator fura-2 (free acid). Under these conditions, 1 mM ATP caused rapid uptake of Ca2+ by a vesicular component of the membrane fraction. Addition of InsP3 (50-2000 nM) caused a dose-dependent release of Ca2+ with a half-maximal effect at 240 nM. In the presence of 3% polyethylene glycol, GTP also stimulated calcium release. However, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, did not release calcium and completely blocked the effect of GTP. Under physiological conditions within the cytosol, the high-affinity InsP3 binding sites characterized in pituitary membranes could serve as the putative receptors through which InsP3 triggers Ca2+ mobilization in the anterior pituitary gland.

The effect of the phorbol esters phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) on changes in free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single rat hepatocytes, microinjected with the photoprotein aequorin, were investigated. [Arg8]vasopressin and phenylephrine induced a series of repetitive [Ca2+]i transients. Phorbol esters inhibited the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-induced response; sub-nanomolar concentrations decreased the transient frequency, and higher concentrations abolished the transients. The inhibitory effect of PDB was readily reversible. Phorbol esters were less effective in decreasing the frequency of [Arg8]-vasopressin-induced transients, and the inhibition could be overcome by high [Arg8]vasopressin concentrations.

When macrophages and neutrophils are allowed to settle onto an appropriate surface, they attach and spread in a frustrated attempt to phagocytose the substrate. Spreading is associated with extensive rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton which resemble those occurring during phagocytosis. We have previously shown that spreading in human neutrophils is preceded by an increase in cytosolic-free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) (Kruskal, B. A., S. Shak, and F. R. Maxfield. 1986. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 83:2919-2923). To assess the generality of this signal, we measured [Ca2+]i in single thioglycollate- elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages as they spread on an immune complex-coated surface, using fura-2 microspectrofluorometry. A [Ca2+]i increase always precedes spreading. This increase can involve several (up to 8) [Ca2+]i spikes, with an average peak value of 387 +/- 227 nM (mean +/- SD, n = 92 peaks in 24 cells), before spreading is detected. Neither spreading nor the magnitude of these spikes is significantly altered by removal of extracellular calcium. Many of the spreading macrophages exhibit periodic [Ca2+]i increases before and during spreading. The proportion which does so varies among experiments from 0 to 90%, but it is frequently greater than 40%. The largest number of cells (approximately 25%) exhibited only a single peak. In 13 cells that showed more than 10 peaks, the median period was 29 s (range 19-69 s). The average peak [Ca2+]i was 385 +/- 266 nM (mean +/- SD, n = 208 peaks in 14 cells). The calcium producing these increases is derived from intracellular pools. The oscillations occur with spreading on either opsonized or nonopsonized surfaces. The function of these oscillations is not clear, but the large number of cells which exhibit them suggest that they may be important to macrophage function.

The relative abilities of seven vasopressin-like peptides to activate hepatic glycogen phosphorylase and stimulate phosphate incorporation into phosphatidylinositol were compared. Although the individual peptides differed in their potencies, the concentrations required to stimulate phosphatidylinositol metabolism were always greater (about 10 times) than those needed to activate phosphorylase. The molecular specificity of the hepatic vasopressin receptor and the role of vasopressin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover are discussed.

1. K-sensitive electrodes placed in the extracellular fluid have been used to show that ATP and noradrenaline cause a rapid loss of up to 10% of the K content of isolated guinea-pig hepatocytes. 2. The hypothesis tha this response is a consequence of a rise in the K permeability of the hepatocyte membrane triggered by an increase in cytosolic Ca is supported by the finding that the divalent cation ionophore A23187 also initiated K loss, in this instance of up to 20-25% of the amount in the cells. 3. Under similar conditions A23187 caused a transient increase, followed by a larger decrease, in the 45Ca content of guinea-pig hepatocytes equilibrated with this isotope. The decrease alone was seen with ATP and noradrenaline. 4. Quinine (1 mM) and the bee venom neurotoxin apamin (10 nM) greatly reduced the effect of ATP, noradrenaline and A23187 on K content without affecting the changes in 45Ca movement. 5. Apamin (10 nM) also abolished the increase in 42K efflux which follows the application of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist amidephrine to rabbit liver slices; the concurrent rises in 45Ca efflux and glucose release were unaffected. 6. It was concluded that quinine and apamin are able to block either the Ca-dependent K channels present in guinea-pig and rabbit liver cell membranes or the mechanism that controls them. 7. Surprisingly, rat hepatocytes took up rather than lost K when treated with the concentrations of ATP, noradrenaline or A23187 that initiated K loss from guinea-pig cells. This response was greatly reduced by ouabain. 8. Application of large concentrations of A23187 to rat hepatocytes caused K loss associated with cell death. 9. The influence of apamin (10-1000 nM) and quinine (200-1000 micro M) on the Ca-dependent K permeability of red blood cells and ghosts was also studied. Apamin was without effect even when applied to both sides of the ghost membrane, whereas quinine caused inhibition, as reported by others. 10. The results suggest that Ca-dependent K channels or carriers are present in the membranes of liver cells of the guinea-pig and rabbit, but are either lacking or inactive in rat liver. The finding that apamin blocks this mechanism in hepatocytes but not in erythrocytes may mean that the channels differ in these cells.

1. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]), if added before GTP, blocks both Ca2+ efflux promoted by GTP and the effect of GTP on enhancement of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-promoted Ca2+ release from preloaded microsomal vesicles. If, however, GTP[S] is added after GTP, it does not reverse the Ca2+ efflux promoted by GTP, nor does it inhibit IP3-promoted Ca2+ release. 2. The effect of GTP in enhancing IP3-promoted Ca2+ release is maintained after washing the microsomal vesicles free of added GTP. After this treatment, enhancement of IP3-promoted Ca2+ efflux can be observed in the absence of poly(ethylene glycol). 3. Electron microscopy shows that during GTP treatment of microsomal vesicles there is rapid production of very large vesicular structures, apparently produced by fusion of smaller vesicles. 4. Light-scattering changes are detectable during the fusion process. 5. Both Ca2+ efflux promoted by GTP and the enhancement of IP3-promoted Ca2+ release seen in the presence of GTP can probably be attributed to GTP-dependent vesicle fusion.ImagesFig. 4.

On addition of ATP to vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, Ca2+ is accumulated from the external medium. Following uptake, spontaneous release of Ca2+ occurs in the presence or in the absence of ATP. These processes of Ca2+ uptake and release were simulated by using the models derived for ATPase activity [Gould, East, Froud, McWhirter, Stefanova & Lee (1986) Biochem. J. 237, 217-227; Stefanova, Napier, East & Lee (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 723-730] and for Ca2+ release from passively loaded vesicles [McWhirter, Gould, East & Lee (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 713-722]. The simulations are consistent with measurements of the effects of pH, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ on uptake and release of Ca2+. The increase in maximal Ca2+ accumulation observed in the presence of maleate is explained in terms of complexing of Ca2+ and maleate within the SR. The calculated concentration of ADP generated by hydrolysis of ATP has a large effect on the simulations. The effects of an ATP-regenerating system on the measured Ca2+ uptake is explained in terms of both removal of ADP and precipitation of Ca3(PO4)2 within the vesicles. It is concluded that both the process of Ca2+ uptake and the process of Ca2+ release seen with SR vesicles can be interpreted quantitatively in terms solely of the properties of the Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase.

1. GTP-promoted fusion between microsomal vesicles was studied by using fluorescence-resonance-energy transfer between the fluorescent membrane probes octadecanoyl-aminofluorescein and octadecyl-rhodamine. 2. The fluorescence increase after GTP addition does not require the presence of ATP, is unaffected by changes in free [Ca2+] in the range 10 microM-1 nM, but requires Mg2+, although higher Mg2+ concentrations are inhibitory. 3. In terms of requirements for poly(ethylene glycol), dependence on GTP concentration and inhibition by high Mg2+ concentrations, there is excellent correlation between rate of increase in fluorescence and rate of GTP-promoted Ca2+ efflux measured under Ca2+ transport conditions. 4. The observations support our previous conclusions that GTP-induced membrane fusion plays a major role in causing GTP-promoted Ca2+ efflux from microsomal vesicles.

Thapsigargin, a sesquiterpene lactone with potent irritant and tumour-promoting activities, stimulates a rapid (within 15 s) transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+] in the NG115-401L neural cell line, as measured by the fluorescent indicator dye fura-2. This increase in cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] is concentration-dependent (ED50 around 20 nM) and occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Activation of NG115-401L cells by the inflammatory peptide bradykinin generates inositol phosphates, which parallel increases in intracellular [Ca2+]. However, the rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] stimulated by thapsigargin occurs in the absence of detectable production of inositol phosphates. Thapsigargin is unlike phorboid tumour promoters in that it has no action on two non-invasive indicators of phorbol stimulation of these cells, i.e. [3H]choline metabolite production and rise in intracellular pH. These data suggest that thapsigargin releases Ca2+ from an intracellular store by a novel mechanism, independent of the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and concomitant activation of protein kinase C. Thus thapsigargin may provide a valuable tool for the analysis of intracellular signalling mechanisms.	A novel tumour promoter, thapsigargin, transiently increases cytoplasmic free Ca2+ without generation of inositol phosphates in NG115-401L neuronal cells.

The effect of phosphorylation by cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) on the activity of the plasmalemmal Ca2+-transport ATPase was studied on isolated plasma membranes and on the ATPase purified from pig erythrocytes and from the smooth muscle of pig stomach and pig aorta. Incubation with G-kinase resulted, in both smooth-muscle preparations, but not in the erythrocyte ATPase, in a higher Ca2+ affinity and in an increase in the maximal rate of Ca2+ uptake. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) did not exert such an effect. The stimulation of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent ATPase activity of the purified Ca2+ pump reconstituted in liposomes depended on the phospholipid used for reconstitution. The stimulation of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity by G-kinase was only observed in the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PI). G-kinase, but not A-kinase, stimulated the phosphorylation of PI to phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) in a preparation of (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase obtained by calmodulin affinity chromatography from smooth muscle, but not in a similar preparation from erythrocytes. Adenosine inhibited both the phosphorylation of PI and the stimulation of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase by G-kinase. In the absence of G-kinase the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase was stimulated by the addition of PIP, but not by PI. In contrast with previous results of Furukawa & Nakamura [(1987) J. Biochem (Tokyo) 101, 287-290], no convincing evidence for a phosphorylation of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase was found. Evidence is presented showing that the apparent phosphorylation occurs in a contaminant protein, possibly myosin light-chain kinase. It is proposed that G-kinase stimulates the plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump of smooth-muscle cells indirectly via the phosphorylation of an associated PI kinase.ImagesFig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.

Isolated hepatocytes from female rats were cultured in HI-WO/BA medium for 6 days. To the medium was added oleate, ethanol, dexamethasone and insulin. With oleate To alone, triacylglycerol accumulated; ethanol augmented the accumulation by 90%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that ethanol in vitro increases the content of triacylglycerol in liver cells. Further addition of dexamethasone or insulin did not alter the accumulation of triacylglycerol, indicating that these hormones did not play permissive roles for the effect of ethanol in the present system. Dexamethasone and insulin, in the absence of ethanol, increased the accumulation of triacylglycerol by 30% and 50% respectively. The concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate was increased in the presence of ethanol; however, with time the concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate declined almost to control values, while the accumulation of triacylglycerol continued linearly; this suggests that the effect of ethanol was not mediated via fluctuations in the concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate. These results are discussed in relation to earlier investigations in vivo and in vitro.ImagesPLATE 1	Accumulation of triacylglycerol in cultured rat hepatocytes is increased by ethanol and by insulin and dexamethasone.

1. Thapsigargin, a sesquiterpene lactone, was shown to cause electrogenic anion secretion in monolayers of human colonic epithelial cells, an effect which was crucially dependent upon calcium and did not involve eicosanoid formation. 2. To measure the secretory effect calcium needed to be present in the external bathing solution. By means of Fura-2 fluorescence measurements thapsigargin was shown to raise Cai by around 250 nM when the bathing solution contained calcium. In the nominal absence of external calcium thapsigargin raised Cai by only 60 nM, but from a lower basal value. This was insufficient to cause secretion. 3. Effects of other calcium-dependent secretagogues (e.g. lysylbradykinin) were inhibited in the presence of thapsigargin, whereas kinin responses were potentiated if the peptide was added following a stimulus which increases cyclic AMP. 4. From the data given here and the known behaviour of colonic epithelia it is concluded that thapsigargin increases Cai by a non-ionophoric mechanism by release from internal stores. Calcium-stimulated calcium influx then follows resulting in the opening of basolateral K channels, increasing the electrochemical gradient for chloride efflux, or alternatively by activating anion channels in the apical membrane. It is concluded that thapsigargin is a potentially important tool for examining epithelial mechanisms.	Thapsigargin, a new calcium-dependent epithelial anion secretagogue.	D. J. Brayden, M. R.

"We have developed a procedure to isolate, from skeletal muscle, enriched terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which retain morphologically intact junctional ""feet"" structures similar to those observed in situ. The fraction is largely devoid of transverse tubule, plasma membrane, mitochondria, triads (transverse tubules junctionally associated with terminal cisternae), and longitudinal cisternae, as shown by thin-section electron microscopy of representative samples. The terminal cisternae vesicles have distinctive morphological characteristics that differ from the isolated longitudinal cisternae (light SR) obtained from the same gradient. The terminal cisternae consist of two distinct types of membranes, i.e., the junctional face membrane and the Ca2+ pump protein-containing membrane, whereas the longitudinal cisternae contain only the Ca2+ pump protein-containing membrane. The junctional face membrane of the terminal cisternae contains feet structures that extend approximately 12 nm from the membrane surface and can be clearly visualized in thin section through using tannic acid enhancement, by negative staining and by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Sections of the terminal cisternae, cut tangential to and intersecting the plane of the junctional face, reveal a checkerboardlike lattice of alternating, square-shaped feet structures and spaces each 20 nm square. Structures characteristic of the Ca2+ pump protein are not observed between the feet at the junctional face membrane, either in thin section or by negative staining, even though the Ca2+ pump protein is observed in the nonjunctional membrane on the remainder of the same vesicle. Likewise, freeze-fracture replicas reveal regions of the P face containing ropelike strands instead of the high density of the 7-8-nm particles referable to the Ca2+ pump protein. The intravesicular content of the terminal cisternae, mostly Ca2+-binding protein (calsequestrin), is organized in the form of strands, sometimes appearing paracrystalline, and attached to the inner face of the membrane in the vicinity of the junctional feet. The terminal cisternae preparation is distinct from previously described heavy SR fractions in that it contains the highest percentage of junctional face membrane with morphologically well- preserved junctional feet structures."

In the isolated perfused rat liver, increasing glucose concentration from 5.5 to 55 mm in the perfusion medium caused a sequential inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase and activation of glycogen synthetase. The latter change was preceded by a lag period which corresponded to the time required to inactivate the major part of the phosphorylase. 2. The same sequence of events was observed in isolated rat hepatocytes incubated at 37C. In this preparation, the rate of phosphorylase inactivation was greatly increased by increasing the concentration of glucose and/or of K+ ions in the external medium. The same agents also caused the activation of glycogen synthetase, but this effect was secondary to the inactivation of phosphorylase. 3. In both types of preparations, the rate of synthetase activation was modulated by the residual amount of phosphorylase a that remained after the initial phase of rapid inactivation and was independent of glucose concentration. 4. In isolated hepatocytes, the rate of conversion of glucose into glycogen was propotional to the activity of synthetase a in the preparation. This conversion was preceded by a lag period which could be shortened by increasing either glucose or K+ concentration in the medium. The incorporation of labelled glucose into glycogen was simultaneous with a glycogenolytic process which could not be attributed to the activity of phosphorylase a.

The structure of the flight muscle of a dragonfly (Aeshna sp.) has been studied with the light and electron microscopes, and the organization of this specialized tubular muscle is described. This tissue is characterized by the great development of the sarcosomes, which are slab-like and are arranged within the fiber opposite each sarcomere of the radially oriented lamellar myofibrils. A well developed and highly ordered sarcoplasmic reticulum is present, consisting of perforated curtain-like cisternae extending across the face of each fibril, together with tubular invaginations of the fiber plasma membrane situated within indentations in the sarcosomes and traversing the fibril surface midway between the Z and M levels. The structure of these fibers, and notably the organization of the reticulum, is compared with that of other types of muscle, and the possible role of the two components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the contraction physiology of the dragonfly muscle fiber is discussed.

Under certain conditions only, isolated crayfish skeletal muscle fibers change in appearance, becoming grainy, darkening, and seemingly losing their striations. These changes result from development of large vesicles on both sides of the Z-line. The longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum remains unaffected. The vesicles are due to swelling of a transverse tubular system (TTS) which is presumably homologous with the T-system tubules of other muscle fibers. The vesiculations occur during efflux of water or on reducing external K or Cl, but only when KCl can leave the fiber. They never result from osmotic, ionic, or electrical changes when KCl cannot leave. Inward currents, applied through a KCl-filled intracellular cathode, also cause the vesiculations. These are not produced when the cathode is filled with K-propionate, nor by outward or longitudinal currents. Thus the transverse tubules swell only when Cl leaves the cell. Accordingly, their membrane is largely or exclusively anion-permselective. These findings also indicate that the TTS forms part of a current loop, connecting with the exterior of the fiber probably through radial tubules (RT) possessing membrane of low conductivity. Thus, part of the current flowing inward across the sarcolemma during activity can return to the exterior through the membrane of the TTS. The structure and properties of the latter offer the possibility for an efficient electrical mechanism to initiate excitation-contraction coupling.

Membrane permeability of an epithelial cell junction (Drosophila salivary gland) was examined with intracellular microelectrodes and with fluorescent tracers. In contrast to the non-junctional cell membrane surface, which has a low permeability to ions (10-4 mho/cm2), the junctional membrane surface is highly permeable. In fact, it introduces no substantial restriction to ion flow beyond that in the cytoplasm; the resistance through a chain of cells (150 Ω cm) is only slightly greater than in extruded cytoplasm (100 Ω cm). The diffusion resistance along the intercellular space to the exterior, on the other hand, is very high. Here, there exists an ion barrier of, at least, 104Ω cm2. As a result, small ions and fluorescein move rather freely from one cell to the next, but do not leak appreciably through the intercellular space to the exterior. The organ here, rather than the single cell, appears to be the unit of ion environment. The possible underlying structural aspects are discussed.	STUDIES ON AN EPITHELIAL (GLAND) CELL JUNCTION I.

The surface structure of a gland epithelium (Drosophila salivary gland), particularly that at the junction between cells, was examined under the electron microscope. The junctional surface, which in the preceding paper was shown to be highly permeable to ions, has the following structural characteristics. About two-thirds of it are profusely infolded; the surface membranes of adjoining cells interdigitate and present desmosomes. The width of the intercellular space varies considerably. The remainder of the junctional surface, the third that abuts on the lumen, is rather straight. Here, the cell membranes are aligned parallel at a distance of 150 A, and interconnected at regular intervals of 100 A. The connecting material has a high electron opacity, and is about as thick as the cell membranes, but, unlike the latter, has no resolvable unit membrane structure. The surface at the cell base, which in the preceding paper was shown to be rather impermeable, is infolded and resembles the infolded junctional region. The luminal surface exhibits microvilli. Critical surface dimensions are given, and the implications of surface structure in intercellular permeability are discussed.	STUDIES ON AN EPITHELIAL (GLAND) CELL JUNCTION II.

Striated muscle fibers from the body and tail myotomes of a fish, the black Mollie, have been examined with particular attention to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and transverse tubular (or T) system. The material was fixed in osmium tetroxide and in glutaraldehyde, and the images provided by the two kinds of fixatives were compared. Glutaraldehyde fixes a fine structure that is broadly comparable with that preserved by osmium tetroxide alone but differs in some significant details. Especially significant improvements were obtained in the preservation of the T system, that is, the system of small tubules that pervades the fiber at every Z line or A-I junction level. As a result of this improved glutaraldehyde fixation, the T system is now clearly defined as an entity of fine structure distinct from the SR but uniquely associated with the SR and myofibrils. Glutaraldehyde fixation also reveals that the T system is a sarcolemmal derivative that retains its continuity with the sarcolemma and limits a space that is in direct communication with the extracellular environment. These structural features favor the conclusion that the T system plays a prominent role in the fast intracellular conduction of the excitatory impulse. The preservation of other elements of muscle fine structure, including the myofibrils, seems for reasons discussed, to be substantially improved by glutaraldehyde.

This is an investigation of the effects on the late after-potential of immersing frog sartorius muscles in three kinds of modified Ringer's fluid; hypertonic, low chloride, and potassium-free. The late after-potential has been attributed to the depolarizing effect of an accumulation of potassium, during a preceding train of impulses, in the intermediary space of the model of a muscle fiber proposed by Adrian and Freygang. Both the hypertonic and low chloride solutions prolonged the late after-potential reversibly and the potassium-free solution shortened it. The effect of the low potassium solution fitted those data calculated from the model, but the effect of the hypertonic and low chloride solutions required an increase in size of the intermediary space of the model in order to fit the calculated data. An electron microscopic study of the muscles showed that the size of the transverse tubular system changed reversibly in the hypertonic and low chloride solutions in almost the amount necessary to fit the experimental data to the calculated data. This agreement between the change in size of the transverse tubular system and that of the intermediary space indicates that the intermediary space may be the transverse tubular system.

Autoradiographs consisting of a 1000 A thick tissue section and a 1400 A thick emulsion film have been prepared from frog toe muscles labeled with Ca45. The muscles had been fixed with an oxalate-containing osmium solution at rest at room temperature, at rest at 4°C, during relaxation following K+ depolarization or after prolonged depolarization. From 6 to 39 per cent of K+ contracture tension was produced during fixation. The grains in the autoradiographs were always concentrated in the center 0.2 to 0.3 µ of the I band and the region of the overlapping of the thick and thin filaments. The greater the tension produced during fixation, the greater was the concentration in the A band and the smaller the concentration in the I band. Autoradiographs of two muscles fixed by freeze-substitution resembled those of muscles which produced little tension during osmium fixation. Muscles which shortened during fixation produced fewer grains. In the narrow (<2.0 µ) sarcomeres of the shortened muscles, grain density decreased with decreasing sarcomere width. A theoretical analysis of the significance of these grain distributions is proposed and discussed.

This study describes the biochemical composition of junctional feet in skeletal muscle utilizing a fraction of isolated triad junctions. [3H]Ouabain entrapment was employed as a specific marker for T-tubules. The integrity of the triad junction was assayed by the isopycnic density of [3H]ouabain activity (24-30% sucrose for free T-tubules, 38- 42% sucrose for intact triads). Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pronase all caused separation of T-tubules from terminal cisternae, indicating that the junction is composed as least in part of protein. Trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolyzed four proteins: the Ca2+ pump, a doublet 325,000, 300,000, and an 80,000 Mr protein. T-tubules which had been labeled covalently with 125I were joined to unlabeled terminal cisternae by treatment with K cacodylate. The reformed triads were separated from free T-tubules and then severed by passage through a French press. When terminal cisternae were separated from T-tubules, some 125I label was transferred from the labeled T-tubules to the unlabeled terminal cisternae. Gel electrophoresis showed that, although T-tubules were originally labeled in a large number of different proteins, only a single protein doublet was significantly labeled in the originally unlabeled terminal cisternae. This protein pair had molecular weights of 325,000 and 300,000 daltons. Transfer of label did not occur to a substantial degree without K cacodylate treatment. We propose that the transfer of 125I label from T-tubules to terminal cisternae during reformation and breakage of the triad junction is a property of the protein which spans the gap between T-tubules and terminal cisternae.

"The triad is the junctional association of transverse tubule with sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternae. A procedure for the isolation of highly enriched triads from skeletal muscle has been described in the previous paper. In the present study, the structural features of isolated triads have been examined by thin-section, negative-staining, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In isolated triads, key features of the structure observed in situ have been retained, including the osmiophilic ""feet,"" junctional structures between the transverse tubule and terminal cisternae. New insight into triad structure is obtained by negative staining, which also enables visualization of feet at the junctional face of the terminal cisternae, whereas smaller surface particles, characteristic of calcium pump protein, are not visualized there. Therefore, the junctional face is different from the remainder of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Junctional feet as viewed by thin section or negative staining have similar periodicity and extend approximately 100 A from the surface of the membrane. Freeze-fracture of isolated triads reveals blocklike structures associated with the membrane of the terminal cisternae at the junctional face, interjunctional connections between the terminal cisternae and t-tubule, and intragap particles. The intragap particles can be observed to be closely associated with the t-tubule. The structure of isolated triads is susceptible to osmotic and salt perturbation, and examples are given regarding differential effects on transverse tubules and terminal cisternae. Conditions that adversely affect morphology must be considered in experimentation with triads as well as in their preparation and handling."	Morphology of isolated triads		6187754	1983-04-01	10	
Tension outputs were measured in skinned crayfish muscle fibers exposed to solutions variously buffered for both Mg-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Ca. Two types of data are shown, relating tension and substrate concentration with different levels of Ca present, or tension and calcium concentration at different levels of substrate. The data are fitted by curves calculated from a general equation for substrate inhibition. The equation is based on the schema that both tension and relaxation are induced by the substrate and that the relaxing effect of excess substrate is repressed by calcium. The physiological findings of the present work are similar to data obtained by others on biochemical model systems of the contractile proteins.

1. Twitch fibres were isolated from the semitendinosus muscles of frogs. The sarcolemma was made more permeable by a 30 min soak in a solution containing 47·3% glycerine (v/v), 2 mM-EGTA and 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7. This was followed by a 30-60 min soak in a solution containing the non-ionic detergent Lubrol-WX. The fibres were then placed in a relaxing medium containing (in mM): KCl, 100; MgCl2, 1; ATP, 4; EGTA, 2; imidazole buffer, 10; pH 7·0.2. A piece of fibre about 1-2 mm long treated as described in (1) was attached to a servo apparatus. This apparatus made it possible either to hold fibre length constant giving isometric conditions, or alternatively to hold the force constant while measuring isotonic length changes. A special network made it possible to switch control from isometric to isotonic conditions so that afterloaded contractions with a shortening stop could be carried out.3. Contractions were induced at about 4° C by lowering the pCa in the relaxing solution to various levels determined by the ratio of calcium and EGTA added. Contractions were never observed above pCa 7. The steady force generated reached a maximum over the range of pCa 6·09 to 5·49. The relationship between steady force generated and pCa is S-shaped and very steep, implying that multiple interacting binding sites for calcium are involved in the force generating process.4. The relative force—velocity relation is the same at pCa 6·09 and 5·49 where the steady force is at a maximum. The data points can be well fitted by a hyperbola in which the extrapolated value for Vmax is 2·39 muscle lengths/sec. The values obtained for the Hill parameters a/P0 and b are within the range of those reported for living electrically excited frog muscle.5. The relative force—velocity points obtained at higher pCa values at which the steady force was on average 37% of that developed at pCa 5·49 can also be fitted by a hyperbola. However, the extrapolated value for Vmax is only 1·12 muscle lengths/sec. The value for a/P0 is increased slightly and the value for b is markedly decreased.6. Evidence is presented against the possibility that an unrecognized fixed internal load is responsible for the change in the relative force—velocity relation obtained at high pCa.7. The relative force—velocity relation does not change appreciably over at least part of the range of sarcomere lengths in which the force generated varies linearly with overlap provided the pCa is held constant.8. The results support the view that lowering the pCa produces a mechanical state equivalent to that produced by tetanic electrical stimulation.9. Some models for calcium activation are discussed. It is concluded that a model based on calcium binding to troponin on the thin filaments is difficult to reconcile with all of the experimental evidence. There is additional evidence for believing that activating calcium may directly influence the cross-bridges.

"The influence of MgATP on the Ga++-activated isometric tension of skinned frog muscle fibers was examined in solutions containing: Mg++ = 5 mM, creatine phosphate (CP) = 14.5 mM, creatinephosphokinase (CPK) = 1 mg/ml, total EGTA = 7 mM, CaCl2, KCl, imidazole ≥ 20 mM so that ionic strength = 0.15, pH = 7.00, and MgATP = 2 mM, 0.1 mM, or 20 µM. CP and CPK were necessary for these experiments as determined experimentally by their effect on the tension-Ca++ relation, which was saturated for CP ≥ 14.5 mM. This was interpreted to mean that sufficient CP was present to effectively buffer MgATP intracellularly. Decreasing MgATP shifts the tension-pCa curve to higher pCa (-log Ca++) so that, for half-maximal tension: pCa1/2 = 4.5 for MgATP = 2 mM, pCa1/2 = 5.1 for MgATP = 0.1 mM, and pCa1/2 = 5.8 for MgATP = 20 µM; maximum isometric tension is the same in all cases, however. If MgATP was decreased to 1 µM, tension at Ga++ > 10–8 M was 84% of the maximum Ca-+-activated tension in 2 mM MgATP and increased only slightly to 90% for pCa = 4.5. Weber (1970, In The Physiology and Biochemistry of Muscle as Food, Volume 2, E. J. Briskey, R. G. Cassens, and B. B. Marsh, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wis.), using similar solutions, observed similar shifts in half-maximal calcium activation of rabbit myofibril ATPase rates. In explanation, Weber and Bremel (1971, In Contractility of Muscle Cells and Related Processes, R. J. Podolsky, editor, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.; Bremel and Weber, 1972, Nat. New Biol., 238:97) have described a mechanism whereby, at low ATP, ""rigor complexes"" are formed between myosin and thin filament actin and, in turn, alter the calcium affinity of one class of the two Ca++-binding sites on troponin, so that the thin filament is ""turned on"" for contraction at lower Ca++ levels. Tension data from skinned fibers substantially supports this hypothesis. A stability constant for CaEGTA of 2.62 x 1010 M–1 was determined, with the help of F. N. Briggs, in solutions similar to those used for skinned fibers and was the same for 100 and 300 mM KCl."

Frog skeletal muscle fibers, mechanically skinned under water-saturated silicone oil, swell upon transfer to aqueous relaxing medium (60 mM KCl; 3 mM MgCl2; 3 mM ATP; 4 mM EGTA; 20 mM Tris maleate; pH = 7.0; ionic strength 0.15 M). Their cross-sectional areas, estimated with an elliptical approximation, increase 2.32-fold (±0.54 SD). Sarcomere spacing is unaffected by this swelling. Addition of 200 mM sucrose to relaxing medium had no effect on fiber dimensions, whereas decreasing pH to 5.0 caused fibers to shrink nearly to their original (oil) size. Decreasing MgCl2 to 0.3 mM caused fibers to swell 10%, and increasing MgCl2 to 9 mM led to an 8% shrinkage. Increasing ionic strength to 0.29 M with KCl caused a 26% increase in cross-sectional area; decreasing ionic strength to 0.09 M had no effect. Swelling pressure was estimated with long-chain polymers, which are probably excluded from the myofilament lattice. Shrinkage in dextran T10 (number average mol wt 6,200) was transient, indicating that this polymer may penetrate into the fibers. Shrinkage in dextran T40 (number average mol wt 28,000), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30 (number average mol wt 40,000) and dextran T70 (number average mol wt 40,300) was not transient, indicating exclusion. Maximal calcium-activated tension is decreased by 21% in PVP solutions and by 31% in dextran T40 solutions. Fibers were shrunk to their original size with 8 × 10-2 g/cm3 PVP K30, a concentration which, from osmometric data, corresponds to an osmotic pressure (II/RT) of 10.5 mM. As discussed in the text, we consider this our best estimate of the swelling pressure. We find that increasing ionic strength to 0.39 M with KCl decreases swelling pressure slightly, whereas decreasing ionic strength to 0.09 M has no effect. We feel these data are consistent with the idea that swelling arises from the negatively charged nature of the myofilaments, from either mutual filamentary repulsion or a Donnan-osmotic mechanism.

1. The force-velocity (P-V) relation for normal or NO-3 treated single fibres isolated from the semitendinosus muscle of the frog was determined at given times during the rise of tension and the plateau of isometric tetani. Experiments were made at about 2.25 micron sarcomere length and at constant temperatures, from 3 to 4.5 degrees C and from 19 to 21 degrees C. The controlled-velocity release method was used. 2. During the rise of tension, at any initial tension higher than about 0.2 P0, the lowest release velocity required to drop the tension to zero was the same as at the tetanic plateau, independent of the temperature and the presence of NO-3 ions in the bathing solution. 3. The degree of activation (measured by the steady force exerted at a given velocity of shortening lower than V0) increased with time, but attained its steady-state level before isometric tension. 4. At about 20 degrees C, frog muscle fibres at about 2.2 micron sarcomere length were only partially activated after a single stimulus. 5. NO-3 ions did not affect the steady-state P-V relation. At about 20 degrees C, NO-3 ions increased the rate of development of activation. Potentiation of the twitch contraction was due at least in part to this mechanism. 6. The 'relative' P-V relation appears to be independent of both the time after start of stimulation and the presence of NO-3 ions in the bathing solution. 7. The results are discussed in terms of the sliding filament model of Huxley (1957), assuming that either the number of actin sites available for cross-bridge formation, or the value of the rate constant for making of cross-bridges, is time dependent.

1. The velocity of shortening at zero load was studied during fused tetanic contractions and single twitches in isolated skeletal muscle fibres of Rana temporaria. 2. The technique used for determination of the speed of unloaded shortening consisted of a series of quick releases of different amplitudes applied at a given instant during activity. The time, delta t, needed for the fibre to take up the slack was plotted against the amplitude of release, delta L. The slope of the straight line relating delta t-delta L provided a measure of the velocity of shortening at zero load, V0. 3. V0 was compared with force-velocity data obtained at finite loads (load-clamp recordings). The predicted velocity of shortening at zero load, derived by hyperbolic extrapolation from velocities at low and intermediate loads, was not significantly different from V0. 4. The temperature dependence of isometric force and of shortening velocity was investigated between 2 and 12 degrees C in the same fibres. Q10 was 2.67 +/- 0.07 (S.E. of mean, n = 6) for V0 and 1.24 +/- 0.01 for tetanic force. 5. The velocity of unloaded shortening was determined at different sarcomere lengths in the range 1.4--3.1 microns. V0 was constant between 1.65 microns and approximately 2.7 microns. It decreased below 1.65 microns and increased above 2.7 microns. 6. The decrease in velocity at short sarcomere lengths probably reflects an increase of the passive resistance to shortening. The increase in velocity at long sarcomere lengths can be accounted for by the passive compressive force that is produced by the parallel elastic elements of the prestretched fibre. 7. V0 was determined at the peak of the twitch and during the plateau of the fused tetanus in the same fibre. Whereas the peak twitch force varied between 38 and 85% of the tetanic tension in the different fibres (mean: 71 +/- 5%, n = 8), V0 during the twitch was 99 +/- 2% of the value recorded during the tetanus. Depression of the isometric twitch amplitude to 10% of the control value by dantrolene did not cause any significant reduction of V0.

A new technique is described for high-speed measurement of striation spacing of single skinned muscle fibres. A galvanometer mirror directs helium-neon laser light on to the muscle fibre at a variable angle. Light diffracted by the cross-striations is collected by a position-sensitive photodetector. The incident angle necessary to centre the diffracted light beam on to the photodetector is related to sarcomere length. The instrument was tested by comparison with measurements obtained with a compound microscope. Discrepancies of several nanometers per half sarcomere were observed between these two methods. When the incident angle of the laser beam was varied sinusoidally about its mean position the magnitude of the discrepancy was reduced. During steady passive shortening of the muscle fibres the output of the diffraction instrument often displayed pauses and brief periods of rapid shortening. These irregularities were eliminated by averaging the sarcomere length output over a range of illumination angles by oscillating the incident angle of the laser beam. The results suggest that at the spatial resolution of several nanometers per half sarcomere, volume diffraction effects can cause the apparent sarcomere length measured from the angle of coherent light diffraction to differ from the mean striation spacing. With incident-angle oscillation the time and spatial resolution of the equipment were satisfactory for the sarcomere length signal to be fed back to a length controller for a 'sarcomere length clamp'. In active contractions, stiffness was closely related to steady developed tension at sub-saturating calcium concentrations. Skinned fibres are less stiff than intact fibres at a given level of developed tension.ImagesFig. 7	Control of sarcomere length in skinned muscle fibres of Rana temporaria during mechanical transients.

1. Isometric force was measured in skinned segments of frog semitendinosus muscle fibres exposed to solutions in which the calcium ion concentration was controlled with EGTA.2. The threshold for force development, calculated from an apparent stability constant for the CaEGTA complex of 106.69 M-1 at pH 7·0, was generally close to pCa 7·5. Maximum force was reached at about pCa 6·0.3. Maximum force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the fibres.4. The rate of force development was slower than that expected from simple diffusion of a substance from the bathing solution into the fibre. The delay appears to be due to slow equilibration of the EGTA buffer system during calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.5. Addition of deoxycholate (DOC) to the bathing solution produced a reversible increase in the rate of force development. The steady force was also increased for values of pCa that gave less than maximum force, which shifted the force—pCa relation toward lower calcium concentrations by about 0·5 pCa unit.6. The length—force relation in partially activated preparations is similar to that reported for electrically activated intact fibres. This result suggests that in the region of myofilament overlap the affinity of the binding sites for calcium is uniform along the length of the calciumbinding myofilament.

1. Segments of rat diaphragms were kept in choline-free media for 4 hr and were then exposed to a physiological concentration of [14C]-choline (30 μM) at 37° C. The synthesis, storage and subsequent release of [14C]acetylcholine by the muscles was assessed by isotopic- and bio-assays after isolation of the transmitter by paper electrophoresis.2. Replacement of endogenous acetylcholine (0·92 μ-mole/kg) with labelled acetylcholine proceeded slowly at rest, but rapidly during nerve stimulation. [14C]Acetylcholine accumulated most rapidly when hydrolysis of the released transmitter, and thus the re-use of endogenous choline, was prevented by an esterase inhibitor. Fully replaced stores were maintained during nerve stimulation by synthesis rates sufficient to replenish at least 35% of the store size in 5 min.3 In the presence of hemicholinium-3, which inhibits choline uptake, acetylcholine stores declined rapidly during stimulation, and residual synthesis was slight, indicating little intraneural choline. Net choline uptake into nerve terminals was estimated from the highest observed synthesis rate and from previous measurements of the number and size of terminals, as 3-6 p-mole/cm2 sec.4. Transmitter synthesis was localized in the region of end-plates, and was reduced to a few per cent of normal 6 weeks after phrenic nerve section. Release experiments suggested that at least half of the acetylcholine in phrenic nerves is in their terminals; from this content and the morphology of the terminals, the average concentration of transmitter in the whole endings would appear to be about 50 m-mole/l. Homogenization of the muscles freed choline acetyltransferase into solution, but left some [14C]acetylcholine associated with small particles, presumably synaptic vesicles.5. Resting transmitter release was about 0·013% of stores/sec. With 360 nerve impulses at 1-20/sec, release increased up to 0·43% of stores/sec, and amounted to 3·5-7 × 10-18 moles per end-plate per impulse. The release rate was unaffected by the doubling of store size which occurred with eserine, but the extra transmitter did help to maintain releasable stores during prolonged stimulation. Experiments with fractional store labelling indicated that newly synthesized acetylcholine was preferentially released.6. Preformed [3H]acetylcholine was not taken up and retained by muscle or nerve cells in the absence of an esterase inhibitor. With eserine present, labelled acetylcholine was taken up uniformly by muscle segments; when eserine was then removed, radioactive acetylcholine remained only near neuromuscular junctions.

1. Voltage-clamp experiments were carried out using the three microelectrode technique. Using this method membrane current density at V1 is proportional to deltaV( = V2 - V1) where V1 and V2 are voltages at distances 1 and 21 from the end of a fibre. Voltage dependent sodium currents were blocked by tetrodotoxin, potassium by tetraethylammonium ions and rubidium. Contraction was blocked by adding sucrose, 467 mM. 2. The current deltaV (control) associated with a positive voltage step from a hyperpolarized conditioning voltage to the holding potential, -80 mV, showed two components, a capacitative transient which decayed rapidly and a maintained steady level...

"A Vaseline gap potentiometric recording and voltage clamp method is developed for frog skeletal muscle fibers. The method is based on the Frankenhaeuser-Dodge voltage clamp for myelinated nerve with modifications to improve the frequency response, to compensate for external series resistance, and to compensate for the complex impedance of the current-passing pathway. Fragments of single muscle fibers are plucked from the semitendinosus muscle and mounted while depolarized by a solution like CsF. After Vaseline seals are formed between fluid pools, the fiber ends are cut once again, the central region is rinsed with Ringer solution, and the feedback amplifiers are turned on. Errors in the potential and current records are assessed by direct measurements with microelectrodes. The passive properties of the preparation are simulated by the ""disk"" equivalent circuit for the transverse tubular system and the derived parameters are similar to previous measurements with microelectrodes. Action potentials at 5 degrees C are long because of the absence of delayed rectification. Their shape is approximately simulated by solving the disk model with sodium permeability in the surface and tubular membranes. Voltage clamp currents consist primarily of capacity currents and sodium currents. The peak inward sodium current density at 5 degrees C is 3.7 mA/cm2. At 5 degrees C the sodium currents are smoothly graded with increasing depolarization and free of notches suggesting good control of the surface membrane. At higher temperatures a small, late extra inward current appears for small depolarizations that has the properties expected for excitation in the transverse tubular system. Comparison of recorded currents with simulations shows that while the transverse tubular system has regenerative sodium currents, they are too small to make important errors in the total current recorded at the surface under voltage clamp at low temperature. The tubules are definitely not under voltage clamp control."	An improved vaseline gap voltage clamp for skeletal muscle fibers		1083424	1976-03-01	10	
1. Delayed K+-currents and displacement currents were studied with a voltage-clamp technique. 2. In normal fibres, the conductance of the delayed channel grows e-fold per 3 millivolts at sufficiently negative potentials and reaches a limiting value of 2-10 m-mho/cm2 (mean 5-8 m-mho/cm2) at positive potentials. Adding tetracaine (2 mM) reduces the limiting conductance, shifts the voltage-dependence of the delayed channel to +25 mV more positive potentials and slows the kinetics fourfold. 3. By contrast, the displacement currents are virtually unaltered by 2 mM tetracaine. Their voltage-dependence is shifted by less than 5 mV and their kinetics are unaffected. 4. Tetraethylammonium ions (TEA) are known to slow the kinetics of delayed K+-channels fivefold but fail, like tetracaine, to change the kinetics of the displacement currents. 5. Both tetracaine and TEA have thus large effects on the 'gating' of the delayed channel, yet little or none on the displacement currents. This suggests that the displacement currents in skeletal muscle are for the most part unrelated to the opening and closing of delayed channels. It is estimated that 'gating' the delayed channel in muscle may require no more than 1 or 2% of the observed charge displacement.

The metallochrome calcium indicators arsenazo III and antipyrylazo III have been introduced individually into cut single frog skeletal muscle fibers from which calcium transients have been elicited either by action potential stimulation or by voltage-clamp pulses of up to 50 ms in duration. Calcium transients recorded with both dyes at selected wavelengths have similar characteristics when elicited by action potentials. Longer voltage-clamp pulse stimulation reveals differences in the late phases of the optical signals obtained with the two dyes. The effects of different tension blocking methods on Ca transients were compared experimentally. Internal application of EGTA at concentrations up to 3 mM was demonstrated to be efficient in blocking movement artifacts without affecting Ca transients. Higher EGTA concentrations affect the Ca signals' characteristics. Differential effects of internally applied EGTA on tension development as opposed to calcium transients suggest that diffusion with binding from Ca++ release sites to filament overlap sites may be significant. The spectral characteristics of the absorbance transients recorded with arsenazo III suggest that in situ recorded signals cannot be easily interpreted in terms of Ca concentration changes. A more exhaustic knowledge of the dye chemistry and/or in situ complications in the use of the dye will be necessary.

Intramembrane charge movements in skeletal muscle fibers contain a tetracaine-sensitive component that can be isolated by the use of this drug. The time course and voltage dependence of this component, studied in relation to antipyrylazo III absorbance signals, suggest its direct involvement in the calcium release process in muscle.

In 1962 Frank (22) reported that the addition of any one of a number of divalent cations, including Ni, to a Ca-free Ringer solution prevented the rapid loss of contractility seen in the absence of external Ca. To investigate further the Ni-Ca substitution, studies were made of 45Ca and 63Ni exchange during contraction and at rest using frog striated muscle. In contrast to 45Ca, it was found that there is no increase of 63Ni uptake associated with a K contracture of the sartorius muscle. The rates of loss of 63Ni and 45Ca from resting toe muscles previously bathed in the respective radioisotopes are not significantly different. Resting and action potentials, after 1 hr in a Ringer solution with Ni replacing Ca, closely resemble these potentials in normal Ca-Ringer's solution. Studies on the syneresis of isolated myofibrils indicate that Ni cannot replace Ca in activating this reaction. It is suggested that Ca is required for at least two steps in E-C coupling: one is the spread of excitation at the sarcolemma and transverse tubular system; the second is the activation of actomyosin ATPase. Conceivably Ni can substitute for Ca in the former but not in the latter.	Nickel Substitution for Calcium in Excitation-Contraction Coupling of Skeletal Muscle	Donald A. Fischman, Roy C.

"Changes in [Mg2+] in a millimolar range have a significant inverse effect on the Ca2+- (or Sr2+)activated tension generation of skeletal muscle fibers. Single frog (Rana pipiens) semitendinosus muscle fibers were ""skinned"" (sarcolemma removed) and contracted isometrically in bathing solutions of varying [Ca2+] or [Sr2+] and [Mg2+] but a constant pH, [MgATP2-], [K+], [CP2-], [CPK], and ionic strength. Ca2+- (or Sr2+- )activated steady-state tensions were recorded for three [Mg2+]'s: 5 X 10(-5)M, 1 X 10(-3) M, and 2 X 10(-3) M; and these tensions were expressed as the percentages of maximum tension generation of the fibers for the same [Mg2+]. Maximum tension was not affected by [Mg2+] within Ca2+-activating or Sr2+-activating sets of solutions; however, the submaximum Ca2+-(or Sr2+)activated tension is strongly affected in an inverse fashion by increasing [Mg2+]. Mg2+ behaves as a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ and also affects the degree of cooperativity in the system. At [Mg2+] = 5 X 10(-5)M the shape of tension versus [Ca2+] (or [Sr2+]) curve showed evidence of cooperativity of Ca2+ (or Sr2+) binding or activation of the contractile system. As [Mg2+] increased, the apparent affinity for Ca2+ or Sr2+ and cooperativity of the contractile system declined. The effect on cooperativity suggests that as [Mg2+] decreases a threshold for Ca2+ activation appears."

The effect of Mg on Ca movement between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and myofilament space (MFS) was studied in skinned muscle fibers by using isometric force as an indicator of MFS Ca. In Ca-loaded fibers at 20 degrees C, the large force spike induced by Ca in 1 mM Mg (5 mM ATP) was strongly inhibited in 3 mM Mg, and force development was extremely slow. After a brief Ca stimulus in 1 mM Mg, relaxation in Ca-free solution was significantly faster in 3 mM Mg. These changes were due to altered Ca movements, since the effect of 3 mM Mg on steady force in CaEGTA solutions was small. Changes in Mg alone induced force transients apparently due to altered Ca movement. In relaxed fibers, decreasing the Mg to 0.25 mM caused phasic force development. In contracting fibers in Ca solutions, increasing the Mg caused a large transient relaxation. The effects of increased Mg were antagonized by 0.5 mM Cd, an inhibitor of the SR Ca transport system. The results indicate that active Ca uptake by the SR in situ is stimulated by Mg, and that it can affect local MFS [Ca++] in the presence of a substantial Ca source. These results provide evidence that an increased rate of Ca uptake in 3 mM Mg could account for inhibition of the large force spike associated with Ca-induced Ca release in skinned fibers.

Chloride-induced Ca release in skinned muscle fibers was studied by measuring isometric force transients and 45Ca loss from fiber to washout solutions. Skinned fibers prepared from muscles soaked in normal Ringer solution made large force transients in 120 mM Cl solution with 5 mM ATP and 1 mM Mg, but 3 mM Mg was inhibitory. Mg inhibition was antagonized by low temperature and by Cd, agents which slow active Ca uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In low Mg++, Cl stimulated rapid 45Ca release from the SR in sufficient amounts to account for the force response. The increased 45Ca release was inhibited by EGTA, suggesting that release requires free Ca under these conditions. The 45Ca initially released was partially reaccumulated later. Reaccumulation was increased in higher Mg++. These results provide additional evidence that the Ca uptake rate is an important determinant of net release, and suggest that Mg++ acts primarily on this mechanism. Skinned fibers prepared from muscles soaked in low Cl solutions could give force responses to Cl solutions with 3 mM and 6 mM Mg. This observation suggests that the Cl stimulus varies with the [Cl] gradient across the internal membranes, and supports the hypothesis that applied Cl causes membrane depolarization.

1. The relative isometric tension—pCa relationship has been determined for isolated bundles of barnacle myofibrils under a variety of ionic conditions using [Ca2+]-buffered solutions which also contained an ATP regenerating system (creatine phosphate and creatine kinase).2. The results are in better agreement with the `consecutive' scheme of reaction rather than with the `independent' alternative (Ashley & Moisescu, 1972) for the co-operative action of two Ca2+ ions in the process of tension activation in crustacean skeletal muscle.3. Variations in the pH of the activating solutions did have a marked effect on the relative tension—Ca curve, although no effect was observed on the absolute maximum value for isometric tension. A shift in pH by 0·5 u. in the range 6·6-7·6 shifted the Ca2+—activation curve by 0·5 log u. towards lower free Ca2+ concentrations.4. Changes in the free Mg2+ concentration of the activating solutions in the millimolar range produced a pronounced shift of the relative tension—pCa curve along the pCa axis. Increasing [Mg2+] from 1 to 5 mM shifted the curve by about 0·7 log u. to higher free Ca2+ concentrations, without significantly modifying its steepness.5. Changes in the MgATP concentration of the activating solutions in the range of 1-13 mM had no significant effect on the relative tension—pCa relationship.6. Varying the K+ concentration in the activating solutions was also observed to have a marked effect upon the tension—pCa relationship in barnacle. An increase in the K+ concentration from 90 to 170 mM shifted the curve by some 0·6 log u. towards higher free Ca2+ concentrations.7. Cooling the standard activating solutions from room temperature to +4° C made no apparent difference to the relative tension—pCa relationship, but decreased significantly the absolute tension responses.8. The results presented show that tonicity by itself has a marked effect upon the absolute steady-state tension levels in isolated bundles of myofibrils.9. Maximum isometric tension in this preparation was not simply related to ionic strength, or to the monovalent cation concentration, but it depended, as well, upon the anionic composition of the activating solution. In addition, a change in ionic strength of 25 mM over the range of 245-270 mM did not appear to modify the relative tension—pCa relationship.10. The effect of the physiologically occurring cations H+, K+, Mg2+ upon the relative isometric tension—pCa relationship can be accounted for on the basis of a model of competitive inhibition between these cations and Ca2+ for the functional unit for tension. This inhibitory effect appears to involve at least one H+, one Mg2+ and two K+ per each Ca2+ ion participating in the activation process of the functional unit for tension.

1. A method for producing rapid [Ca2+] and [Sr2+] changes in the frog skinned muscle fibre preparation while maintaining constant all other cationic concentrations (Moisescu, 1976a, b) is described and analysed in detail. 2. Different experiments, some of them involving the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, as well as theoretical considerations, indicate that with this method one can produce a Ca2+ (or Sr2+) concentration change within 0.1--0.15 sec in a whole preparation having a diameter of 50 micrometer. 3. The rate of force development was similar to that observed in vivo. 4. The radial diffusion coefficient of EGTA in relaxed myofibrillar preparations was measured and found to be 4.6 x 10(-6) cm2sec-1 at 20 degrees C. 5. The sarcoplasmic reticulum in myofibrillar bundles was found to be active with respect to both Ca2+ and Sr2+ in the solutions used ([Mg2+] 1 mM; [Na] 30 mM; [K] 140-170 mM; [Cl] less than or equal to 20 mM; pH 7.10). 6. The amount of Ca released by caffeine from internal stores (previously loaded with Ca) can raise the total Ca concentration in the muscle fibre preparation by at least 1.8 mM. 7. The presence of 10 mM-caffeine in all bathing solutions reduced drastically the ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to accumulate both Ca and Sr.	Calcium and strontium concentration changes within skinned muscle preparations following a change in the external bathing solution.

1. Excitation-contraction coupling process in isolated frog muscle fibres, under conditions which allow the development of a Ba permeability, has been investigated by the simultaneous recording of electrical and mechanical activity. 2. The sustained contraction elicited by a long lasting Ba action potential depends on two mechanisms. The first is potential dependent, the second which is inhibited by MnCl2 (10 mM), depends on the inward flux of Ba ions. 3. The relationship observed between the inward IBa and the peak tension resembles that which has been observed between ICa and the contraction on other muscular structures. 4. The relative tension progressively declines as the intracellular Ba concentration increases and the contractility ends after a series of depolarizing pulses (or Ba action potentials). This indicates that the Ba ions which enter the cell release Ca ions and replace them in the intracellular storage sites. 5. Following a pretreatment with caffeine, the inward IBa fails to induce a contraction. Moreover a muscle which has been loaded with barium until the contraction ceases, does not develop a contracture in presence of caffeine. These results show that the Ba induced Ca release is located at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 6. Calculations show that the amount of Ba ions necessary to abolish the contractility corresponds to the maximum ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum for Ca binding. 7. Almost all the inward flux of Ba ions and the contraction are abolished by glycerol-treatment which suggests that the coupling occurs at the T-system level. The results are discussed in regard to the technical limitations of the voltage-clamp method.	Slow inward barium current and contraction on frog single muscle fibres.

1. A vaseline-gap voltage-clamp technique was used to record slow Ca2+ and K+ currents from frog skeletal muscle fibres loaded with the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. 2. K+ currents were increased when Mg2+ replaced external Ca2+, and they were abolished when internal K+ was replaced by tetraethylammonium (TEA+). Ca2+ currents could be studied in isolation in fibres loaded with (TEA)2EGTA. 3. Under maintained depolarization, Ca2+ currents slowly increase (half-time of 35 msec or more at 25 mV) and then decline to a steady value. Decline under repolarization is rapid (half-time of 6-7 msec) and complete. During an action potential, the Ca2+ influx through this system is probably less than the influx observed with tracers. 4. Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Mn2+ and Mg2+ can carry current across the membrane; Ni2+ and Co2+ cannot. Ca2+ currents are weakly blocked by external Mg2+.

1. Force responses from mechanically skinned fibres of rat skeletal muscles (extensor digitorum longus and soleus) were measured at different temperatures in the range 3-35 degrees C following sudden changes in Ca2+ concentration in the preparations. 2. At all temperatures there were characteristic differences between the slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibres with respect to the relative steady-state force-[Ca2+] relation: such as a lower [Ca2+] threshold for activation and a less steep force-pCa curve in slow-twitch muscle fibres. 3. At 3-5 degrees C the force changes in both types of muscle fibres lagged considerably behind the estimated changes in [Ca2+] within the preparations and this enabled us to perform a comparative analysis of the Ca2+ kinetics in the process of force development in both muscle fibre types. This analysis suggest that two and six Ca2+ ions are involved in the regulatory unit for contraction of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibres respectively. 4. The rate of relaxation following a sudden decrease in [Ca2+] was much lower in the slow-twitch than in the fast-twitch muscle at 5 degrees C, suggesting that properties of the contractile apparatus could play an essential role in determining the rate of relaxation in vivo. 5. There was substantial variation in Ca2+ sensitivity between muscle fibres of the same type from different animals at each temperature. However the steepness of the force-[Ca2+] relation was essentially the same for all fibres of the same type. 6. A change in temperature from 5 to 25 degrees C had a statistically significant effect on the sensitivity of the fast-twitch muscle fibres, rendering them less sensitive to Ca2+ by a factor of 2. However a further increase in temperature from 25 to 35 degrees C did not have any statistically significant effect on the force-[Ca2+] relation in fast-twitch muscle fibres. 7. The effect of temperature on the Ca2+ sensitivity of slow-twitch muscle fibres was not statistically significant, mainly because of the large variation in sensitivity amongst these preparations at room temperature. 8. Two types of oscillatory processes not associated with intracellular membranes were observed in the force response of all slow-twitch muscle fibres when submaximally activated (less than 60% maximum force) at 25 and 35 degrees C, but never at 3-5 degrees C. The frequency of oscillations increased with temperature. 9. Maximum Ca2+-activated force in both muscle fibre types was greatly dependent upon temperature over the range 0-25 degrees C, but increased only slightly above 25 degrees C. 10. Experiments on the rigor state suggest that the number of possible actomyosin interacting sites diminishes considerably as temperature is decreased below 25 degrees C.

1. Steady-state force—pCa relations were determined for mechanically skinned fibres of fast- and slow-twitch rat skeletal muscle, extensor digitorum longus (e.d.l.) and soleus respectively, at varied sarcomere lengths and temperatures (3-35 °C).2. This relation was different for the two fibre types at all sarcomere lengths, with soleus fibres having lower Ca2+ concentration threshold for activation and requiring a wider Ca2+ concentration range to reach force saturation.3. An increase in sarcomere length within the range 2·2-3·6 μm reversibly shifted the steady-state force—pCa curves for both fast- and slow-twitch fibres toward lower Ca2+ without affecting the steepness of the curves.4. The results are consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca2+ is increased with increasing sarcomere length.5. The change in apparent Ca2+ sensitivity (measured as the change in pCa corresponding to 50% Ca-activated force (ΔpCa50)) was approximately proportional to the change in sarcomere length (ΔSL) at all temperatures for both types of muscle fibre.6. The proportionality coefficient (ΔpCa50/ΔSL) was higher for slow-twitch fibres than for fast-twitch fibres by a factor of 1·5-2·0 at all temperatures investigated.7. The force—pCa relation was less affected by changes in sarcomere length at lower (3-5 °C) than at higher temperatures (22-35 °C).8. The sarcomere length—maximum force relation obtained with skinned fibres for sarcomere lengths between 2·10 and 4·05 μm was similar for both fibre types at all temperatures despite large temperature dependent variations in maximum Ca-activated force response. Maximum force decreased linearly to zero between ca. 2·8 and 3·95 μm; remained high and essentially constant between ca. 2·40 and 2·80 μm, and decreased significantly below 2·40 μm.9. Myofilament-generated tension oscillations produced by partially activated soleus skinned fibres are highly length dependent, disappearing completely when sarcomere length is increased above 3·15 μm.

Ca influx and efflux in single twitch muscle fibers were determined by the movement of 45Ca. The isotope was assayed by counting the center 1 cm of a fiber while it was in nonradioactive Rnger's solution. The average resting influx in 1.0 mM Ca Ringer's was 0.26 pM Ca/cm2. sec for 5 to 20 min influx periods. The average additional influx upon stimulation in 1.0 mM Ca was 0.73 pM Ca/cm2. twitch. The efflux after both resting and stimulated 45Ca influx can be described by a single exponential curve with an average time constant of 125 min. This relationship is an indication of Ca exchange with a single intracellular compartment. This compartment contains an estimated 47% of the total muscle Ca at 1.0 mM Ca. When the Ca in the Ringer was reduced to 0.5 mM Ca, both the resting and stimulated Ca fluxes decreased. When Ca was raised to 1.8 mM, the stimulated influxes increased but the resting influx did not.	Ca Fluxes in Single Twitch Muscle Fibers	B. A. Curtis	11526827	1966-11-01	10	
"""Skinned"" muscle fibers, single fibers from the frog semitendinosus muscle in which the sarcolemma had been removed, could be reversibly activated by electrical stimulation. Electrical responsiveness was abolished when the skinned fiber was prepared from a muscle exposed to a cardiac glycoside, and the development of responsiveness was delayed when the muscle was bathed in high potassium solution. The findings were taken as evidence that active sodium-potassium exchange across the internal membranes restored electrical excitability, after the sarcolemma had been removed, by establishing a potential gradient across the internal membranes. In general, the contractions were graded with the strength of the applied current. On occasion, however, ""all-or-none"" type responses were seen, raising the possibility that the internal membranes were capable of an electrically regenerative response. Activation could also be produced by an elevation of the intracellular chloride ion concentration or a decrease in the intracellular potassium, ion concentration, suggesting that depolarization of some element of the internal membrane system, that is, a decrease in the potential of the lumen of the internal membrane system relative to the potential of the myofibrillar space, was responsible for activation in these experiments. The distribution of both the electrically induced contractions and those produced by changes in the intracellular ion concentrations indicated that the responsive element of the internal membrane system was electrically continuous over many sarcomeres."

Radioautographs of 45Ca-labeled frog skeletal muscles have been prepared using freeze-dry and vapor fixation techniques to avoid displacement of the isotope during the preparation of the radioautographs. 45Ca has been localized in resting muscles exposed to 45Ca Ringer's for 5 min or 5 hr and in isotopically labeled muscles recovering from tetanic stimulation at room temperature or at 4°C. In muscles soaked at rest for 5 min 45Ca was present almost exclusively in the terminal cisternae. In all other muscles there were three sites at which the isotope was concentrated: (a) the terminal cisternae, (b) the intermediate cisternae and the longitudinal tubules, and (c) the A band portion of the myofibrils. The terminal cisternae were labeled more rapidly than the myofibrils, but both exchanges were accelerated by electrical stimulation. The amount of 45Ca in the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate cisternae decreased with time after a tetanus as the amount in the terminal cisternae increased. It is proposed that electrical stimulation releases calcium from the terminal cisternae and that relaxation occurs from the binding of the released calcium by the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate cisternae. Complete recovery from mechanical activity involves the transport of this bound calcium into the reticulum and its subsequent binding by the terminal cisternae. Resting exchange of calcium occurs primarily between the terminal cisternae and the transverse tubules.

1. The kinetics of mechanical activation were examined in muscle fibres of the frog's sartorius muscle, using a voltage clamp to control membrane potential, tetrodotoxin to eliminate electrical activity and microscopic observations to determine the mechanical threshold.2. The strength—duration curve was determined over a range of membrane potentials varying between -52 mV (rheobase) and +90 mV. At 4° C the critical duration was about 11 msec at -30 mV, 4 msec at 0 mV and 2 msec at +40 mV.3. For pulses where V > -10 mV the threshold criterion at 4° C was that the `area above -30 mV' must exceed about 120 mV msec.4. The effect of a brief subthreshold pulse declines with a time constant of about 3 msec at -100 mV and about 8 msec at -85 mV at 4° C.5. Although the strength—duration curve is well fitted by assuming a first-order mechanism in which the rate of release of activator increases with membrane potential, other experiments show that the over-all mechanism is probably second order in time.6. A short pulse must be at least 50% threshold if it is to give a visible contraction when added to a long pulse which is just below rheobase.7. Delayed rectification was conspicuous with medium or long pulses which were just below the mechanical threshold, but short pulses could give contraction without turning on any appreciable potassium conductance.8.

1. The uptake of 45Ca and the development of force by segments of skinned muscle fibres were measured in Ca solutions buffered with EGTA. When the Ca ion concentration in these solutions was above the contraction threshold, Ca was accumulated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum during the delay phase before force developed. The uptake rate increased, and the length of the delay decreased, when the concentration of the calcium buffer was increased.2. The maximum accumulation of Ca was 2-3 mM. Force developed, ending the delay phase, when the calcium uptake approached this maximum level.3. The pattern of force development suggested that this process was often accompanied by a sudden release of accumulated Ca.4. The relation between the kinetics of 45Ca uptake and the interaction of calcium with EGTA and the sarcoplasmic reticulum is discussed. The data indicate that at the low concentrations necessary for relaxation the sarcoplasmic reticulum takes up Ca fast enough to account for the rate at which force falls when intact muscle fibres relax.

At least 50% of the T-system surface is freely accessible from the sarcoplasm. Of the remainder, 30% of the total T-system surface is covered by the junctional feet, and 20% in the center of the junction may or may not be accessible. The possibility is discussed that the triadic junction may not function as an electrical coupling."	STUDIES OF THE TRIAD II.

Reconstruction from thick serial transverse slices of frog skeletal muscle fibers stained with peroxidase and examined by high-voltage electron microscopy has revealed that the T system networks at successive sarcomeres are connected together in a helicoidal fashion. From zero to eight helicoids have been found in each of a group of 21 fibers reconstructed in cross section. Helicoids can have either right- or left-handed screw senses, and both senses can be found in one fiber cross section. Because the T system maintains a relatively precise alignment with the myofibrillar striations, it follows that the striations must also have a helicoidal arrangement. This has been found before, but has not been widely accepted in recent times. The presence of helicoids in the bands and membrane networks is not thought per se to alter very much our thinking about excitation and contraction mechanisms in skeletal muscle fibers.ImagesFIGURE 1FIGURE 3FIGURE 4FIGURE 5	Helicoids in the T system and striations of frog skeletal muscle fibers seen by high voltage electron microscopy.

Stimulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release by Mg reduction of caffeine was studied in situ, to characterize further the Ca2+ dependence observed previously with stimulation by Cl ion. 45Ca efflux and isometric force were measured simultaneously at 19 degrees C in frog skeletal muscle fibers skinned by microdissection; EGTA was added to chelate myofilament space Ca either before or after the stimulus. Both Mg2+ reduction (20 or 110 microM to 4 microM) and caffeine (5 mM) induced large force responses and 45Ca release, which were inhibited by pretreatment with 5 mM EGTA. In the case of Mg reduction, residual efflux stimulation was undetectable, and 45Ca efflux in EGTA at 4 microM Mg2+ was not significantly increased. Residual caffeine stimulation at 20 microM Mg2+ was substantial and was reduced further in increased EGTA (10 mM); at 600 microM Mg2+, residual stimulation in 5 mM EGTA was undetectable. Caffeine appears to initiate a small Ca2+- insensitive efflux that produces a large Ca2+-dependent efflux. Additional experiments suggested that caffeine also inhibited influx. The results suggest that stimulated efflux is mediated mainly or entirely by a channel controlled by an intrinsic Ca2+ receptor, which responds to local [Ca2+] in or near the channel. Receptor affinity for Ca2+ probably is influenced by Mg2+, but inhibition is weak unless local [Ca2+] is very low.

1. Single twitch fibres were isolated from frog muscle, then mounted in a chamber which was positioned on an optical bench. The fibres were immobilized by high stretch (sarcomere spacing 3·9-4·3 μm) and by placement on a pedestal. Their optical properties were determined by illuminating a 35-65 μm diameter spot with quasimonochromatic light of intensity I0 and measuring the intensity I of the transmitted light. Since the main purpose of the experiments was to draw inferences from the absorbance spectra of different indicator dyes injected into the fibres, all results were expressed in terms of absorbance A calculated from the equation [Formula: see text]. Changes in absorbance ΔA were calculated from the differential form of the equation [Formula: see text].2. The absorbance of a normal, non-injected fibre was, on average, equal to 0·03 at 570 nm and varied approximately inversely with wavelength between 450 and 750 nm.3. The earliest change in absorbance following an action potential was a small, transient increase which was followed by a larger decrease. The decrease in fibre absorbance varied from 0·5 × 10-4 to 3 × 10-4 units.4. Resting myoplasmic pH was determined by comparing the absorbance spectrum from fibres injected with Phenol Red with that obtained from calibrating solutions in cuvettes. The muscle measurements were corrected for the intrinsic absorbance of fibre without dye. The average value of pH in two fibres was 6·9. The change in absorbance following an action potential in these highly stretched fibres was small. In one experiment the change, if due to pH alone, corresponded to an increase in pH of 0·004 peak and 0·002 maintained (relative to a resting level of 6·9). The maintained signal can be satisfactorily explained by the known amount of phosphocreatine hydrolysis.5. Estimates of myoplasmic free [Mg2+] were made using three metallochromic indicator dyes. A different estimate was obtained with each dye as indicated below. Since these dyes are sensitive to pH, as well as [Mg2+], the estimate depends on the assumed value of intracellular pH. [List: see text] This variability probably means that at least two, and possibly all three dyes behave differently inside muscle fibres than they do in calibrating solutions. The most likely explanation is that dye, once injected, can bind to cellular contents and that this alters its properties.6. Changes in absorbance of fibres injected with Arsenazo I, a dye three times more sensitive to Mg2+ than to Ca2+, were used to determine whether changes in free [Mg2+] occur following an action potential. The observed changes were small and could be due to a small increase in pH, of the magnitude measured with Phenol Red, and/or free [Mg2+]. In terms of a change in free [Mg2+], the results set an upper limit of 2%.7. The conclusion from the action potential experiments is that neither intracellular pH nor free [Mg2+] changes appreciably in highly stretched fibres. Changes in these two quantities can therefore be neglected in analysing the relatively large 650-660 nm Ca2+ signal in fibres injected with the Ca2+ (but also pH and Mg2+) sensitive indicator dye Arsenazo III.

Total diffusible magnesium concentration in frog skeletal muscle is 5.2 mM as determined by electron probe microanalysis of 0.2 nl liquid samples. The calculated free Mg concentration, 0.2 mM, is at the lower end of the range of values reported by others as calculated by methods using nuclear magnetic resonance, Mg-selective microelectrodes, and metallochromic indicator dyes. Magnesium is but one of many elements of physiological importance in muscle that can be analyzed using this novel liquid-sampling and x-ray spectroscopic method.

The Ca2+ channel blocker D-600 (methoxyverapamil) paralyses single muscle fibres of the frog: fibres exposed to the drug at 7 degrees C give a single K+ contracture after which they are paralysed, unable to contract in response to electrical stimulation or further applications of K+. Paralysed fibres contract in response to caffeine and have normal resting potentials and action potentials. Fibres treated with D-600 at 22 degrees C are not paralysed. Paralysed fibres warmed to 22 degrees C recover contractile properties: they twitch and give K+ contractures. Other workers have shown that D-600 blocks a Ca2+ channel at room temperature; thus, the paralytic action of D-600 is probably mediated by a different membrane protein, perhaps a different Ca2+ channel from that blocked at room temperature. These results suggest that the binding of D-600 can disrupt the mechanism coupling electrical potential changes across the T membrane to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

1. A method is described by which a selective lesion can be made in vitro in the transverse tubules of frog skeletal muscle.2. The method consists of exposing the muscle for 1 hr or more to a buffered salt solution made hypertonic by the inclusion of 400 mM glycerol and then returning the muscle to an isotonic salt solution. The lesion is induced during the washout of the glycerol.3. Electron micrographs reveal that the lesion consists of a rearrangement of the T-system membranes in such a way that the continuity of the tubules is lost. The membranes appear to coalesce into large vesicles scattered irregularly throughout the sarcoplasm.4. The glycerol treatment results in a depression of the resting potential of up to 30 mV. The treated fibres are depolarized by high concentrations of K as are normal muscle fibres.5. T-tubule lesioned fibres are unable to respond mechanically either to electrical stimulation or to elevated K but they do contract in the presence of caffeine and relax when the caffeine is removed.6. Problems concerning the variability of the procedure are presented and certain considerations concerning the mechanism of the effect are discussed.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3	A lesion of the transverse tubules of skeletal muscle	J.

Microprocessor-controlled changes of [free Ca2+] at the outer surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) wrapped around individual myofibrils of a skinned canine cardiac Purkinje cell and aequorin bioluminescence recording were used to study the mechanism of Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ from the SR. This Ca2+ release is triggered by a rapid increase of [free Ca2+] at the outer surface of the SR of a previously quiescent skinned cell. Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ occurred under conditions that prevented any synthesis of ATP from ADP, was affected differentially by interventions that depressed the SR Ca2+ pump about equally, and required ionic conditions incompatible with all known Ca2+- releasing, uncoupled, partial reactions of the Ca2+ pump. Increasing the [free Ca2+]trigger up to an optimum increased the amount of Ca2+ released. A supraoptimum increase of [free Ca2+] trigger inactivated Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+, but partial inactivation was also observed at [free Ca2+] below that necessary for its activation. The amplitude of the Ca2+ release induced by a given increase of [free Ca2+] decreased when the rate of this increase was diminished. These results suggest that Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ is through a channel across the SR membrane with time- and Ca2+-dependent activation and inactivation. The inactivating binding site would have a higher affinity for Ca2+ but a lower rate constant than the activating site. Inactivation appeared to be a first-order kinetic reaction of Ca2+ binding to a single site at the outer face of the SR with a Q10 of 1.68. The removal of inactivation was the slowest step of the cycle, responsible for a highly temperature-dependent (Q10 approximately 4.00) refractory period.

The recently described calcium channel agonists Bay-K8644 and CGP-28392 have been used to induce long-term opening of calcium channels from purified rat muscle transverse tubules (t-tubules) incorporated into planar phospholipid bilayers. Agonist-open channels are selective for divalent cations (except Mg++), display voltage-dependent kinetics, and are blocked by the calcium channel antagonist, nitrendipine. The sensitivity to dihydropyridine agonists and antagonists indicate that a pool of t-tubule calcium channels remain functional after membrane fractionation and purification.

Intact cardiac cells from the adult rat or rabbit ventricle were isolated by enzymatic digestion with a progressive increase of the [free Ca2+] in the solution. These cells were electrically stimulated in the presence of 2.50 mM free Ca2+, and a twitch of maximum amplitude was elicited by the positive inotropic interventions that were found to be optimum. Then the cells were chemically skinned, and the maximum tension induced by a saturating [free Ca2+] was used as a reference to express the tension developed during the twitch of the intact cells. The myoplasmic [free Ca2+] reached during the twitch was inferred from the tension-pCa curve. In mechanically skinned cells of the same animal species, the myoplasmic [free Ca2+] reached during Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was inferred by two methods using (a) the tension-pCa curve and (b) a direct calibration of the transients of aequorin bioluminescence. The induction of a maximum Ca2+ release from the SR required a larger Ca2+ preload of the SR and a higher [free Ca2+] trigger in the rabbit than in the rat skinned cells. However, the results obtained with the two methods of inference of the myoplasmic [free Ca2+] suggest that in both animal species a maximum myoplasmic [free Ca2+] of pCa approximately 5.40 was reached during both the optimum Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ from the SR of the skinned cells and the optimum twitch of the intact cells. This was much lower than the [free Ca2+] necessary for the full activation of the myofilaments (pCa approximately 4.90).

1. Extrinsic fluorescence intensity changes were studied in frog semitendinosus muscles stained with Nile Blue A in response to electrical stimulation. Muscles were stretched and put into hypertonic solutions to prevent movement. The muscles were illuminated at 90 degrees to their long axis with a narrow beam of light at a central wave-length of 6250 . Fluorescence emission was measured at 90 degrees to the exciting light using a filter which absorbed light of wave-lengths shorter than 6400 . 2. In response to a single stimulus the fluorescence intensity increases briefly. The fluorescence response is propagated at a constant velocity of about 1.5 m/sec. The average ratio of the maximum fluorescence intensity change to the resting fluorescence is 4.5 times 10-3 for supramaximal shocks. The fluorescence intensity change starts early in the falling phase of the action potential. 3. The fluorescence intensity change increases when nitrate replaces chloride and decreases when D2O replaces H2O. The rates of rise and fall of the fluorescence change was unaffected by nitrate replacement of chloride but are slowed where D2O replaces H2O. The rates of rise and fall of the fluorescence change increase with increasing temperature for all solutions used. The peak fluorescence intensity change, however, goes through a maximum at about 17 degrees C for aqueous chloride and nitrate solutions in the range of 10-25 degrees C. With D2O solutions, the peak fluorescence intensity increases monotonically in this range of temperatures. 4. The fluorescence intensity change in response to trains of action potentials are not additive. 5. Depolarization of muscles treated with tetrodotoxin using triangular-shaped fluid electrodes produces an increase in fluorescence at about the same threshold values required to elicit tension in preparations that are not fully stretched. The fluorescence intensity change precedes in time tension development. Near threshold depolarizations, the delay in onset of the fluorescence response can be 80 msec or longer. Byond threshold, delays become shorter and peak responses larger. During maintained depolarization, after the peak response, fluorescence declines to a plateau value. 6. The results suggest that the fluorescence intensity changes are associated with excitation-contraction coupling, possibly with changes in the transmembrane potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Maximal concentrations of substance P and methacholine induced a rapid increase in [3H]inositol trisphosphate ([3H]IP3) formation. After about 1 min, the [3H]IP3 in the substance-P-treated cells ceased to increase further, whereas in the methacholine-treated cells [3H]IP3 continued to increase. Addition of methacholine to the substance-P-treated cells caused a rapid increase in [3H]IP3, whereas a second addition of a 10-fold excess of substance P had no effect. Pretreatment of cells with substance P, followed by removal of the substance P by washing, resulted in a decreased response to a second application of substance P. A similar protocol involving pretreatment with methacholine had no effect on subsequent responsiveness to substance P. Analysis of [3H]substance P binding to substance-P-treated cells indicated that the number of receptors for substance P was decreased, but the affinity of the receptors for substance P was unaffected. After substance P pretreatment, a prolonged incubation (2 h) restored responsiveness of the cells to substance P, measured as [3H]IP3 formation, and restored the number of binding sites to control values. These findings indicate that, in the rat parotid gland, substance P induces a homologous desensitization of its receptor, which involves a slowly reversible down-regulation or sequestration of substance-P-binding sites.

Pure samples of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate were prepared and tested for their ability to mobilize calcium from intracellular stores in a permeabilized Swiss mouse 3T3 cell preparation. In this system inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ with a half-maximal dose of 0.3 microM. Inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate mobilized Ca2+ to the same extent with a half-maximal dose of 0.3 microM, whereas inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate required a half-maximal dose of approx. 9 microM to give the same effect. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was ineffective up to 20 microM and at that concentration did not antagonize the mobilization induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The relevance of these findings to the function of the inositol tris/tetrakis-phosphate pathway is discussed.

1. The membrane response to applied histamine of cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical vein was studied by use of whole cell and single channel patch clamp techniques. A value of -27 +/- 1.4 mV was found for the resting potential under whole cell current clamp. No voltage-gated currents were seen at either the macroscopic or single channel levels. 2. At holding potentials of -20 to -40 mV, histamine evoked slow rising, long lasting whole cell inward currents. The inward current was associated with depolarization and decreased input resistance. The calcium ionophore A23187 provoked similar whole cell inward currents. 3. Single channel currents were observed in cell-attached and inside-out patches for both histamine and A23187. The single channel conductance was about 20 pS with a mean open time of 5 ms and a reversal potential of 0 mV in symmetrical potassium solutions. Internal sodium blocked outward going currents. 4. For cell-attached patches, histamine-dependent channel activity required external calcium and was also seen when histamine was present in the bath but not the pipette. Recording from inside-out patches revealed that decreases in 'internal' calcium resulted in the disappearance of channel activity. 5. The histamine-dependent inward current appears to involve calcium-dependent activation of cationic channels.	Histamine-induced inward currents in cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical vein.

1. ATP and ATP analogues induced prostacyclin (PGI2) secretion from human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells. 2. The threshold active concentration for ATP was less than or equal to 1 microM. The rank order of potency of analogues was 2-chloroadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-ClATP) greater than 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-MeSATP) greater than ATP greater than ADP, while adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)triphosphonate, AMP and adenosine were inactive, indicating the presence of P2y-purinoceptors. 3. In contrast to their actions on P2y-receptors in guinea-pig taenia coli, isopolar analogues of 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphonate were less effective than ATP. 4. ATP and ATP analogues increased intracellular free calcium ions, [Ca2+]i, giving a rapid transient peak due predominantly to release from intracellular stores, followed by a maintained steady-state elevated level due to influx. 5. The dose-response curves for peak [Ca2+]i induced by ATP, 2-ClATP and 2-MeSATP were very similar to those for PGI2 production. 6. Elevations of [Ca2+]i, above a threshold value of 0.8-1 microM, were necessary for PGI2 production in response to P2y-receptor activation. 7. The dose relationships between PGI2 release and peak [Ca2+]i were equivalent whether [Ca2+]i was raised by ionomycin or via P2y-receptor activation by ATP or 2-ClATP, indicating that elevations of [Ca2+]i provide the major, if not the exclusive intracellular pathway for P2y-purinoceptor-mediated PGI2 synthesis.

Endothelial cells are known to release prostacyclin (PGI2) in response to agonists, and this has generally been assumed to be caused, at least in part, by activation of a phospholipase A2 by elevated concentrations of cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i). However, it has been shown in the blood platelet that agonists can cause arachidonate release without elevating [Ca2+]i. In the present study, rigorous analysis is made of the [Ca2+]i-dependence of PGI2 production in the human umbilical-vein endothelial cell. Thrombin caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i from the resting basal value of 0.1 microM to a peak, within 10-15 s, of approx. 2 microM. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i then declined back to the resting value within 2-3 min. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i partly decreased to a new steady-state value of approx. 1 microM. The elevated [Ca2+]i was maintained while the stimulus and the source of extracellular Ca2+ were present, suggesting that it was dependent on influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Thrombin stimulated the production of PGI2 in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, the production of PGI2 was more prolonged in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Total accumulated amounts of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha on stimulation with thrombin without extracellular Ca2+ were only 65% of those accumulated with extracellular Ca2+ present. Cells depleted of extracellular and intracellular sources of Ca2+ by incubation with 1 mM extracellular EGTA and exposing them to ionomycin to discharge intracellular stores produced no elevation of [Ca2+]i on stimulation with thrombin or production of PGI2. The threshold [Ca2+]i required to support the production of PGI2 was measured to be 0.8-1.0 microM by using different doses of ionomycin selectively to increase [Ca2+]i. This relationship between [Ca2+]i and PGI2 production was similar to that produced by using different doses of thrombin. Our results show that the major and probably exclusive intracellular stimulus for the production of PGI2 by the vascular endothelial cell in response to thrombin is the elevation of [Ca2+]i.

The effects of two inhibitors of the microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase, thapsigargin and 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, were compared in hepatocytes and in a T-cell line (JURKAT). Both compounds mobilized the same intracellular Ca2+ pool, which contained the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store, in hepatocytes and in JURKAT cells. The mobilization of the internal Ca2+ store with either compound activated Mn2+ entry in JURKAT cells, but not in hepatocytes. This suggests different properties of the bivalent-cation entry pathway between these cell types.

The effects of the Ca2+-mobilizing hormones noradrenaline, vasopressin and angiotensin on the unidirectional influx of Ca2+ were investigated in isolated rat liver cells by measuring the initial rate of 45Ca2+ uptake. The three hormones increased Ca2+ influx, with EC50 values (concentrations giving half-maximal effect) of 0.15 microM, 0.44 nM and 0.8 nM for noradrenaline, vasopressin and angiotensin respectively. The actions of noradrenaline and angiotensin were evident within seconds after their addition to the cells, whereas the increase in Ca2+ influx initiated by vasopressin was slightly delayed (by 5-15s). The activation of Ca2+ influx was maintained as long as the receptor was occupied by the hormone. The measurement of the resting and hormone-stimulated Ca2+ influxes at different external Ca2+ concentrations revealed Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics compatible with a saturable channel model. Noradrenaline, vasopressin and angiotensin increased both Km and Vmax. of Ca2+ influx. It is proposed that the hormones increase the rate of translocation of Ca2+ through a common pool of Ca2+ channels without changing the number of available channels or their affinity for Ca2+.

1. The effects of adrenaline on Ca distribution in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were studied using a 45Ca exchange technique under steady-state conditions with respect to the net movement of Ca. 45Ca was initially introduced into the extracellular medium. The amount of cellular 45Ca was determined after separation of the cells from the medium by centrifugation through a solution which contained LaCl3 (to displace 45Ca bound to sites on the outside of the cell membrane) and silicon oil. At 1·3 and 2·4 mm-extracellular Ca, a stimulation of the initial rate of 45Ca exchange was observed in the presence of 10-7 m-adrenaline (or 10-6 m-phenylephrine) with a 7% decrease, and no change, respectively, in the plateau of the exchange curve. The same degree of stimulation was observed when 45Ca was added at 1, 15, 30 or 45 min after the adrenaline.2. No stimulation of the initial rate of exchange was observed at 0·1 mm-extracellular Ca, or at 2·4 mm-extracellular Ca in the presence of antimycin A and oligomycin. At 0·1 mm-Ca, a 60% decrease in the plateau of the exchange curve was observed in the presence of adrenaline. The concentration of adrenaline (10-7 m) which caused half-maximal stimulation of the initial rate of 45Ca exchange at 1·3 mm-Ca was similar to that (2 × 10-7 m) which caused half-maximal decrease in the plateau at 0·1 mm-Ca.3. The addition of adrenaline to cells equilibrated with 45Ca at either 2·4 or 1·3 mm-Ca caused a transient loss of 45Ca followed by a return to a new steady state after 1 or 10 min, respectively. A loss of 45Ca was also observed at 0·1 mm-Ca, but the 45Ca content of the cells remained maximally depressed for at least 30 min.4. A non-linear least-squares iterative curve-fitting technique was used to demonstrate that (a) an equation which includes two exponential terms and (b) a parallel or series arrangement of three compartments of exchangeable Ca (the medium and two compartments associated with the cell) are consistent with each set of data obtained at 1·3 or 2·4 mm-Ca in the presence or absence of adrenaline (or phenylephrine). At 1·3 mm-Ca, the quantities of exchangeable Ca in the two kinetically defined cellular compartments were 0·04-0·07 and 0·34-0·37 nmol per mg wet weight with rate constants for Ca outflow of 1·2-1·5 and 0·06-0·08 min-1, respectively.5. Analysis of the changes induced by adrenaline or phenylephrine showed that at 1·3 and 2·4 mm-extracellular Ca these agents caused a 75-150% increase in the quantity of exchangeable Ca in the small kinetically defined compartment and a 20% decrease in the quantity of exchangeable Ca in the large kinetically defined compartment. These changes were mediated by an 80-160% increase in the rate constant for the inflow of Ca from the medium to the small kinetically defined compartment, and either a 20-60% decrease in the rate constant for inflow to, or a 20% increase in the rate constant for outflow from, the large compartment.6. Replacement of the LaCl3 in the solution used to separate the cells from the incubation medium with either 5 mm-EGTA or 5 mm-CaCl2 did not alter the kinetics of 45Ca exchange or the stimulation by adrenaline. This, together with the observation that at 1·3 mm-extracellular Ca, adrenaline increases the initial rate of exchange in the absence, but not in the presence, of antimycin A plus oligomycin, indicates that both cellular compartments of exchangeable Ca are intracellular.7. The addition of antimycin A plus oligomycin to cells equilibrated with 45Ca at 2·4 mm-extracellular Ca in the presence or absence of adrenaline displaced 0·09 and 0·14 nmol 45Ca. mg-1, respectively.8. Subcellular fractionation of cells equilibrated with 45Ca at 0·1 mm-extracellular Ca revealed that the mitochondria and microsomes contained significant amounts of 45Ca. The amounts of 45Ca in these fractions decreased by 50 and 40%, respectively, in the presence of adrenaline.9. In 45Ca exchange experiments conducted with isolated mitochondria at 37 °C at 1·5 × 10-7 m and 0·9 × 10-7 m free Ca in the presence of 2 mm-Mg2+, one kinetically defined compartment of exchangeable mitochondrial Ca was detected. The rate constants for Ca outflow were found to be 0·15±0·03 and 0·12±0·04 min-1, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the value obtained for the rate constant for the outflow of Ca from the large kinetically defined compartment of exchangeable Ca observed in cells.10. It is concluded that adrenaline has two effects on Ca movement in the liver cell. These are to cause a loss of Ca from an intracellular compartment, which includes the mitochondria and microsomes, and to increase the transport of Ca from the extracellular medium to an intracellular site. This results in an increase in the amount of Ca in a small intracellular compartment which may represent cytoplasmic Ca, or Ca bound to sites on the inside of the plasma membrane.

1. The free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can be measured using Fura-2 in superfused single human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When an endothelial cell is stimulated by a maximal dose of histamine (100 microM), [Ca2+]i rises to a peak and then falls back to a maintained plateau which is due to a stimulated Ca2+ influx. 2. If extracellular Ca2+ is replaced by 50 microM-Mn2+ then 100 microM-histamine causes a rise in [Ca2+]i accompanied by a fluorescence quench that signals the stimulated entry of Mn2+ into the cytoplasm. 3. If in Ca2(+)-free solution a cell is stimulated by 100 microM-histamine for 120 s to discharge the internal Ca2+ store, and then exposed to 50 microM-Mn2+ after removal of the histamine, a similar stimulated Mn2+ entry is seen. This quench is unaffected by readdition of histamine and is not seen if the store is refilled by exposure to 1 mM-extracellular Ca2+ for 180 s before exposure to the Mn2+. 4. The refilling of the internal store by exposure to 1 mM-Ca2+ and the stimulated entry of Mn2+ are both blocked by 2 mM-Ni2+. 5. If [Ca2+]i is stimulated to produce repetitive spikes by a low dose of histamine (0.3-1 microM) in nominally Ca2(+)-free solution containing Mn2+, then the stimulated quench is uniform and is not modulated by the [Ca2+]i spiking. 6. If the internal store is discharged by exposure to histamine in Ca2(+)-free solution and then refilled for a short period then the cell is in a state where the internal store is partly full to an extent that depends on the duration of the refilling. In such an experiment, the rate of Mn2+ influx may be estimated by measuring the rate of quench during a short exposure to 50 microM-Mn2+. The rate of Mn2+ entry varies inversely with the degree of fullness of the internal Ca2+ store. 7. If a similar experiment is repeated but with the fullness of the internal store being varied by varying the period of the initial exposure to 100 microM-histamine, with no refilling, the same inverse relationship between Mn2+ influx and fullness of the internal store is obtained. 8. These experiments show that Mn2+ enters human umbilical vein endothelial cells following agonist stimulation by a pathway that is controlled by the degree of fullness of the internal store; it does not, however, enter the cytoplasm by exactly the same route as Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Agonist-stimulated divalent cation entry into single cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

A Ca2+-sensitive electrode was used to study net Ca2+-flux changes induced by the administration of phenylephrine, vasopressin and angiotensin to the perfused rat liver. The studies reveal that, although the Ca2+ responses induced by vasopressin and angiotensin are similar, they are quite different from the Ca2+ fluxes induced by phenylephrine. The administration of phenylephrine is accompanied by a stimulation of a net amount of Ca2+ efflux (140 nmol/g of liver). A re-uptake of a similar amount of Ca2+ occurs only after the hormone is removed. In contrast, the administration of vasopressin or angiotensin to livers perfused with 1.3 mM-Ca2+ induces the release of a relatively small amount of Ca2+ (approx. 40 nmol/g of liver) during the first 60 s. This is followed by a much larger amount of Ca2+ uptake (70-140 nmol/g of liver) after 1-2.5 min of hormone administration, and a slow efflux or loss of a similar amount of Ca2+ over a period of 6-8 min. At lower concentrations of perfusate Ca2+ (less than 600 microM) these hormones induce only a net efflux of the ion. These results suggest that at physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ the mechanism by which alpha-adrenergic agonists mobilize cellular Ca2+ is different from that involving vasopressin and angiotensin. It seems that the hormones may have quite diverse effects on Ca2+ transport across the plasma membrane and perhaps organellar membranes in liver.	The Ca2+-mobilizing actions of vasopressin and angiotensin differ from those of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine in the perfused rat liver.	J G Altin, F L Bygrave	4091828	1985-12-15	10	
We have investigated the unusual observation that depolarization of rat basophilic leukemia cells in high potassium not only fails to induce secretion, but also inhibits the secretion induced when receptors for IgE are aggregated by antigen. Antigen-stimulated 45Ca uptake and the rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium measured with the fluorescent indicator quin2 were both inhibited in depolarized cells. 45Ca efflux, on the other hand, was unaffected, which confirms that IgE receptor activation was not impaired in high potassium. Unlike the large increase in total cell calcium seen when cells in normal saline solution were stimulated with antigen, there was a decrease in total cell calcium when depolarized cells were stimulated. This is consistent with our finding that 45Ca uptake was inhibited while 45Ca efflux was unaffected. Inhibition of 45Ca uptake and secretion closely paralleled the decrease in membrane potential, and could be overcome by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. We conclude that changes in the electrochemical gradient for calcium are important in determining calcium influx and the magnitude of antigen-stimulated secretion from rat basophilic leukemia cells, while the release of calcium from intracellular stores is unaffected.

1. In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular calcium, bradykinin (0.3 nM-100 nM) induced a biphasic elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in bovine aortic endothelial cells, consisting of an initial, large transient component followed by a lower sustained component. 2. When endothelial cells were bathed in nominally calcium-free solution containing 0.5 mM EGTA, bradykinin induced only a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i: the magnitude of this was significantly smaller than that obtained in the presence of extracellular calcium and the sustained phase was abolished. In the continued presence of bradykinin, re-addition of extracellular calcium to achieve a level of around 1.8 mM resulted in the induction of a biphasic elevation of [Ca2+]i consisting of a large initial component followed by a lower sustained component. 3. In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular calcium, caffeine (5 mM) induced a small elevation of [Ca2+]i. When endothelial cells were bathed in nominally calcium-free solution containing 0.5 mM EGTA, the caffeine-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was almost completely abolished. 4. In the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular calcium, treatment of endothelial cells with the calcium influx blocker, nickel chloride (4 mM), had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i or on the magnitude of the bradykinin-induced initial transient elevation of [Ca2+]i but abolished the sustained component. 5. In the presence of 1 mM extracellular calcium, treatment with the calcium chelator EGTA (2 mM; 1 min) had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i but the magnitude of the bradykinin-induced initial transient elevation of [Ca2+]i was significantly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Bradykinin induces elevations of cytosolic calcium through mobilisation of intracellular and extracellular pools in bovine aortic endothelial cells.

A novel inhibitor of receptor-mediated calcium entry (RMCE) is described. SK&F 96365 (1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxy-phenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H- imidazole hydrochloride) is structurally distinct from the known 'calcium antagonists' and shows selectivity in blocking RMCE compared with receptor-mediated internal Ca2+ release. Human platelets, neutrophils and endothelial cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2(+)-indicator dyes quin2 or fura-2, in order to measure Ca2+ or Mn2+ entry through RMCE as well as Ca2+ release from internal stores. The IC50 (concn. producing 50% inhibition) for inhibition of RMCE by SK&F 96365 in platelets stimulated with ADP or thrombin was 8.5 microM or 11.7 microM respectively; these concentrations of SK&F 96365 did not affect internal Ca2+ release. Similar effects of SK&F 96365 were observed in suspensions of neutrophils and in single endothelial cells. SK&F 96365 also inhibited agonist-stimulated Mn2+ entry in platelets and neutrophils. The effects of SK&F 96365 were independent of cell type and of agonist, as would be expected for a compound that modulates post-receptor events. Voltage-gated Ca2+ entry in fura-2-loaded GH3 (pituitary) cells and rabbit ear-artery smooth-muscle cells held under voltage-clamp was also inhibited by SK&F 96365; however, the ATP-gated Ca2(+)-permeable channel of rabbit ear-artery smooth-muscle cells was unaffected by SK&F 96365. Thus SK&F 96365 (unlike the 'organic Ca2+ antagonists') shows no selectivity between voltage-gated Ca2+ entry and RMCE, although the lack of effect on ATP-gated channels indicates that it discriminates between different types of RMCE. The effects of SK&F 96365 on functional responses of cells thought to be dependent on Ca2+ entry via RMCE were also studied. Under conditions where platelet aggregation is dependent on stimulated Ca2+ entry via RMCE, the response was blocked by SK&F 96365 with an IC50 of 15.9 microM, which is similar to the IC50 of 8-12 microM observed for inhibition of RMCE. Adhesion and chemotaxis of neutrophils were also inhibited by SK&F 96365. SK&F 96365 is a useful tool to distinguish RMCE from internal Ca2+ release, and to probe the role of RMCE in mediating functional responses of cells. However, SK&F 96365 is not as potent (IC50 around 10 microM) or selective (also inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ entry) as would be desirable, so caution must be exercised when using this compound.

The steady-state ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic-reticulum (Ca(2+)-Mg2+)-ATPase is inhibited by thapsigargin at a molar ratio of 1:1, with a dissociation constant for thapsigargin estimated to be in the sub-nanomolar range. In the presence of thapsigargin, only a single Ca2+ ion binds to the ATPase. Similarly, addition of thapsigargin to the ATPase incubated in the presence of Ca2+ results in the release of one of the two originally bound Ca2+ ions. As monitored by the fluorescence of nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labelled ATPase, thapsigargin appears to shift the transition between E1 and E2 conformations towards E2. Addition of thapsigargin prevents phosphorylation of the ATPase by P(i) and results in a very low steady-state level of phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP, as observed previously for nonylphenol.

We have studied the fluorescence of the Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The change in intensity of fluorescein fluorescence caused by addition of Ca2+ to the labelled ATPase can be interpreted in terms of a two-conformation model for the ATPase, one conformation (E1) having a high affinity for Ca2+, the other (E2) a low affinity. Effects of Ca2+ as a function of pH allow an estimate of the effect of pH on the E1/E2 ratio, consistent with kinetic studies. A model is presented for binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase as a function of pH that is consistent both with the data on the E1/E2 equilibrium and with literature data on Ca2+ binding.

Bradykinin elicits relaxation of isolated transverse rings of canine coronary, celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, splenic, pulmonary, gastric, and femoral arteries. After endothelial cells of the vessel wall are removed by rubbing of the intimal surface, canine arteries fail to relax upon addition of bradykinin. The endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine arteries remains intact after treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin and flurbiprofen), and this argues against mediation by prostaglandins. When they are stimulated with bradykinin, endothelial cells of canine arteries appear to release a substance mediating vascular smooth muscle relaxation. In contrast, preparations of arteries of cats (superior mesenteric) and rabbits (superior mesenteric and celiac) may be rubbed on the intimal surface without a consistent loss of sensitivity to the relaxing effects of bradykinin. In addition, relaxation of the cat and rabbit arteries is completely blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Preliminary studies indicate that bradykinin relaxes human arteries in an endothelium-dependent manner and that this effect is not mediated by prostaglandins. We have previously reported that arteries of all species tested require the presence of endothelial cells for relaxation in response to acetylcholine and we have also demonstrated, using the rabbit aorta, that this effect is mediated by the release of an uncharacterized substance from these cells that relaxes vascular smooth muscle. We conclude that bradykinin relaxes canine and human arteries via a similar mechanism but that it relaxes cat and rabbit arteries by stimulating release of prostaglandins from as yet undefined cell types.

1. Experiments were designed to determine the role of the endothelium in relaxations of isolated blood vessels caused by ACh, adenine nucleotides and K+ ions. 2. Paired rings of canine femoral arteries were mounted for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with aerated Krebs-Ringer solution (37 degrees C). One ring served as control; in the other ring the intimal layer was removed mechanically. 3. Removal of the endothelium only slightly depressed the maximal contractile response to noradrenaline, and did not affect the apparent sensitivity to the catecholamine. It depressed the contractile response to 25-60 mM-K+ more than that to noradrenaline. 4. In the absence of endothelium, the femoral arteries did not relax on exposure to ACh. 5. Removal of the endothelium did not affect relaxations caused by adenosine and AMP, but markedly reduced those caused by ADP and ATP. 6. The relaxations induced by 5.9 mM-K+ were comparable in control rings and arteries denuded of their endothelium. 7. These experiments demonstrate that in the canine femoral artery, relaxations induced by ACh, ADP and ATP require the presence of functional endothelial cells, which, when exposed to these substances, initiate an inhibitory signal for the smooth muscle cells of the media. By contrast, relaxations of isolated arteries caused by adenosine, AMP and K+ ions must be due mainly to a direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle cells.

1. Quisqualate- and kainate-induced currents were recorded in mouse central neurones in culture, using both 'whole-cell' and 'outside-out' configurations. Experiments were made at room temperature. 2. Both quisqualate- and kainate-induced currents invert at 0 mV when the extracellular and intracellular solutions contain similar concentrations of monovalent cations. The changes of reversal potential produced by changes in the monovalent cation concentrations are consistent with the hypothesis that both agonists activate channels selectively permeable to cations. 3. The spectral analysis of the quisqualate- and kainate-induced currents recorded in the whole-cell mode indicates that the main component of the quisqualate noise has a time constant of 10-15 ms while the main component of the kainate noise has a time constant of 2-3 ms. 4. In outside-out patches most of the quisqualate-induced current was carried by channels with a conductance of about 8 pS. A small fraction of the quisqualate-induced current appears to be carried by two other channels: the 'NMDA channel' (40-50 pS) (Ascher, Bregestovski & Nowak, 1988) and a 'fast' channel, with a conductance of 15-35 pS, which was not activated by low concentrations of L-glutamate or by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). 5. Most of the kainate-induced current can be attributed to a channel characterized by a conductance of about 4 pS. Here again, outside-out patches revealed the presence of an additional channel, with a conductance of about 20 pS. 6. The results are consistent with the notion that there are at least three distinct receptors for excitatory amino acids, each preferentially activated by either NMDA, quisqualate or kainate, each opening channels with multiple conductance states. Other possibilities are discussed.	Quisqualate- and kainate-activated channels in mouse central neurones in culture.	P Ascher, L Nowak	2457088	1988-05-01	10	
1. Glutamate-receptor ion channels in rat cerebellar granule cells maintained in explant cultures have been investigated with patch-clamp methods. Properties of these channels were determined from noise analysis of whole-cell currents and from noise and single-channel currents recorded in outside-out membrane patches. 2. Glutamate (10-20 microM) evoked two types of response. Some granule cells gave small inward currents accompanied by clear increases in current noise ('large noise' responses), whereas other cells gave larger inward currents and small noise increases ('small noise' responses). 3. A mean single-channel conductance (gamma) of 46.6 pS was estimated for glutamate from four 'large noise' cells. A mean gamma value of 8.4 pS was estimated for seven other 'large noise' cells. The results suggest that in these latter cells glutamate activated both large (approximately equal to 50 pS) and small conductance (approximately equal to 140 fS) channels. 4. Applications of aspartate (10-30 microM) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 10-30 microM) produced small inward currents and large increases in noise; gamma noise = 48.5 pS (aspartate) and 46.7 pS (NMDA). 5. Large single-channel currents were evoked by glutamate, aspartate and NMDA in outside-out patches. The mean conductance values obtained for the largest amplitude openings were: gamma(glutamate) = 49.5 pS, gamma(aspartate) = 51.5 pS, and gamma(NMDA) = 53.0 pS. For each agonist, these 50 pS openings comprised 75-85% of the completely resolved currents in each patch. Openings to 40 and 30 pS conductance levels accounted for 10-15% and 3-7% of the total, and the presence of apparently direct transitions between these levels and the 50 pS level suggests they are sublevels of the same multi-conductance channels. 6. A mean channel conductance of 22.9 pS was estimated from noise evoked by quisqualate (10-30 microM). Single-channel currents were examined in four patches. In two, quisqualate evoked predominantly small currents of two amplitudes, gamma = 8.4 pS and 16.5 pS; some 50 pS openings were also present. In the other two patches, most openings were 50 pS events. 7. Granule cells gave inward currents to kainate (10-30 microM), and a mean conductance of 3.1 pS was estimated from kainate noise. In patches in which aspartate or NMDA produced mainly 50 pS openings, more than 74% of the single-channel currents evoked by kainate were of smaller amplitude, with mean conductances of gamma = 8.1 and 15.1 pS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Noise and single channels activated by excitatory amino acids in rat cerebellar granule neurones.

1. Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked between pairs of cultured neurones from either hippocampus or spinal cord were examined using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. 2. Using the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), two components of the EPSP could be resolved in cultures from both brain regions. The APV-sensitive (slow) component had the same latency, but a much slower time-to-peak and longer duration than the APV-resistant (fast) component. Other NMDA antagonists such as ketamine also selectively blocked the slow component of the EPSP. 3. In Mg2+-free medium, the dual-component EPSP had a duration lasting up to 500 ms, greatly exceeding the membrane time constant of the postsynaptic neurone, suggesting that persistent activation of NMDA receptors was responsible for the long duration of the APV-sensitive component. 4. Under voltage clamp the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) also showed fast and slow components, both of which had a reversal potential near 0 mV in physiological saline. The synaptic current could be fitted with a sum of two exponentials with a decay time constant for the slow EPSC near 80 ms. The slow current contributed approximately 50% of the total charge transfer during the EPSC. 5. In Mg2+-containing medium, the peak of the fast component was voltage insensitive, whereas the synaptic current measured at a latency of 10-50 ms was voltage dependent with a region of negative slope conductance at membrane potentials hyperpolarized to -30 mV. 6. Raising [Ca2+]o from 1 to 20 mM resulted in a shift of the reversal potential of the APV-sensitive component from near 0 mV to + 10 mV, but the reversal potential of the fast component remained near 0 mV. This suggests that conductances with different ionic permeability underlie the two components of the EPSC and that the slow component is highly permeable to Ca2+ as well as to monovalent cations. 7. Our results demonstrate that two functionally distinct excitatory amino acid receptor channels are simultaneously activated by transmitter release from a single presynaptic neurone. The conductance mechanism underlying the slow component of the EPSP displays the voltage dependence and Ca2+ permeability expected for NMDA-receptor channels. We suggest that the available conductance generating the slow EPSP may be sufficient, even at low firing rates, to influence excitability on both a short-term and more long-lasting basis.

1. The whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp method were used to investigate the properties of the channels activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA channels) in mouse central neurones in culture. Recording was made in Mg2+-free solutions. 2. In the whole-cell recording mode the currents induced by both NMDA and L-glutamate were accompanied by a large increase in noise. In both cases the noise power spectra were well fitted by single Lorentzian functions and the corresponding mean time constant, tau, was about 6 ms at room temperature. The single-channel conductance, gamma n, estimated from the ratio of the noise variance to the total current, varied between 22 and 40 pS. 3. Endogenous amino acids known to activate NMDA receptors (L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-cysteine sulphinate and quinolinate) as well as exogenous NMDA agonists such as ibotenate and trans-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylate (trans-PDA) all produced similar responses. In particular, analysis of the current noise yielded tau values between 4 and 8 ms in all cases. 4. NMDA responses were antagonized by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) without any effect on gamma n or tau values measured by noise analysis; NMDA responses were also diminished by D-alpha-aminoadipate and cis-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylate. 5. In outside-out patches, it was observed that the single-channel current amplitude varies linearly as a function of membrane potential between -80 and +60 mV. The reversal potential is near 0 mV. NMDA channels are permeable to Na+, K+ and Cs+, but blocked by choline. The single-channel conductance, gamma e, varies between 40 and 50 pS at room temperature. 6. The NMDA channels open in bursts of short openings interrupted by brief closures. At -60 mV, the closures had a mean duration, tc, of 0.4 +/- 0.2 ms. The mean channel open time, to, was 5.9 +/- 1.0 ms for NMDA and 5.3 +/- 1.7 ms for L-glutamate. The mean burst duration, tb, was 10.5 +/- 0.7 ms for NMDA and 8.5 +/- 2.0 ms for L-glutamate. 7. When the temperature was increased between 14 and 24 degrees C, the NMDA channel conductance increased with a Q10 of 1.6 while the mean open time decreased with a Q10 close to 2. 8. The NMDA channel showed, in addition to the 'main' conductance state (40-50 pS), smaller conductance states of 15 and 35 pS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated channels of mouse central neurones in magnesium-free solutions.

"Patch-clamp recording techniques were used to study the properties of amino acid-activated channels in cultured ""organotypic"" slices from rat cerebellum and hippocampus. Hippocampal pyramidal cells responded to the three main glutamatergic agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp), quisqualate, and kainate, whereas Purkinje cells responded only to quisqualate and kainate. Analysis of single-channel events recorded in outside-out patches from hippocampal neurons showed large conductance events (50 pS), which occurred more frequently in the presence of glycine. These events could be produced by N-Me-D-Asp and also, at low frequency, by quisqualate. On the other hand, 50-pS events were never observed in Purkinje neurons. This supports the hypothesis that N-Me-D-Asp and ""non-N-Me-D-Asp"" receptors are distinct molecular entities. Comparison of whole-cell and outside-out patch recordings from Purkinje cells revealed a clear spatial segregation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptors: although GABA receptors are found at high density in somatic membrane, quisqualate and kainate receptors are mostly extrasomatic. The results show that organotypic slice cultures are amenable to patch-clamp methods. They also show that, in these cultures, amino acids receptors have specific distribution patterns according to cell type and to region within a cell."

1. The pharmacological properties of excitatory amino acid responses on ganglion cells dissociated from the rat retina were examined with the use of the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. 2. L-Glutamate at a concentration of 50 microM produced inward non-desensitizing currents at negative holding potentials in nearly every cell tested (83%, n = 18) In physiological solutions, L-glutamate responses reversed at approximately -9 mV, and higher concentrations of this agonist introduced a desensitizing component to the response. 3. At negative holding potentials, kainate (25-125 microM) produced inward currents in all of the cells tested (n = 37). These currents never desensitized, even at high agonist concentrations, and reversed near -6 mV. Currents induced by 50 microM-kainate were reversibly antagonized by kynurenate (100-300 microM) but not by 100 microM-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). 4. Quisqualate generated smaller, non-desensitizing currents in only 50% of the cells tested (n = 38). Quisqualate responses reversed in polarity near -4 mV and were maximal at an agonist dose of 25 microM, with higher concentrations introducing a rapidly desensitizing component without a detectable increase in amplitude. Currents produced by quisqualate at a concentration of 50 microM were not antagonized by either 750 microM-kynurenate or 100 microM-APV. 5. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) produced inward currents at negative holding potentials in 68% of the cells tested (n = 31), but only when magnesium was excluded from the extracellular medium. NMDA currents were non-desensitizing at agonist concentrations of up to 200 microM, with higher concentrations introducing a rapidly desensitizing component. NMDA (200 microM) responses were blocked by APV (100 microM) and kynurenate (300 microM) and reversed near -1 mV. 6. Responses generated by kainate (50-125 microM) were antagonized by quisqualate (30-250 microM). This antagonism occurred even in cells having no measurable response to quisqualate alone, suggesting the possibility that quisqualate may be acting both as an agonist, in the 50% of the cells that have the quisqualate-specific receptor, and as an antagonist, at the kainate-specific site on all cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Responses mediated by excitatory amino acid receptors in solitary retinal ganglion cells from rat.

1. Patch-clamp methods have been used to examine the action of excitatory amino acids on three types of glial cell in cultures of rat cerebellum, namely type-1-like astrocytes, type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In addition we have examined glutamate sensitivity of the precursor cell (the O-2A progenitor) that gives rise to type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. 2. Glutamate (30 microM), quisqualate (3-100 microM), (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA, 10-30 microM) and kainate (10-500 microM) were applied to cerebellar type-2 astrocytes examined under whole-cell voltage clamp. Each of these agonists induced inward currents in cells held at negative membrane potentials. The currents reversed direction near 0 mV holding potential. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 30-100 microM) or aspartate (30 microM) in the presence of glycine (1 microM) did not evoke any whole-cell current changes in type-2 astrocytes. 3. The distribution of glutamate receptors in type-2 astrocytes was mapped with single- or double-barrelled ionophoretic pipettes containing quisqualate or kainate. Application of these agonists (current pulses 100 ms, 50-100 nA) to cells held at -60 mV evoked inward currents of 20-120 pA in the cell soma and 10-80 pA in the processes. Responses could also be obtained at the extremities of processes (approximately 60 microns from the soma). 4. Quisqualate or kainate (at 30 microM) applied to O-2A progenitor cells from rat cerebellum or optic nerve induced whole-cell currents (quisqualate 20-30 pA; kainate 20-50 pA, holding potential, Vh = -60 mV) that reversed near 0 mV. In common with type-2 astrocytes, the progenitor cells did not respond to NMDA (30 microM). 5. Type-1-like astrocytes produced large inward currents to glutamate (30 microM). These currents remained inward-going at holding potentials as positive as +80 mV and were not accompanied by any apparent noise increase. This result can be explained by the presence of an electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier. In cells kept up to 4 days in vitro, quisqualate, kainate and NMDA each failed to produce any whole-cell current changes, indicating the absence of receptors in type-1-like astrocytes at this stage in culture. Furthermore the glutamate uptake currents in type-1-like astrocytes were inhibited when external Na+ was replaced by Li+, although Li+ was found to pass through the glutamate channel in type-2 astrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)ImagesFig. 1Fig. 4Fig. 6	Activation of glutamate receptors and glutamate uptake in identified macroglial cells in rat cerebellar cultures.

1. The whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique were used to record responses to excitatory amino acids in mouse hippocampal neurones in cell culture at different pH. The amino acids kainate, quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-glutamate were applied by a rapid perfusion system. 2. In the whole-cell recording mode the responses to NMDA or to low concentrations of glutamate, recorded in the absence of Mg2+ and with glycine in the extracellular superfusion solution, were antagonized by acidic pH and potentiated by an alkaline extracellular solution. Decrease in pH from 7.3 to 6.0 reduced NMDA responses to 33 +/- 2% and an increase in pH from 7.3 to 8.0 potentiated it to 141 +/- 6%. The responses to quisqualate and kainate were only slightly changed by altering the pH from 7.3 to 6.3 or 8.3. 3. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for H+ antagonism of responses to NMDA, estimated from the fit of a single-binding-site adsorption isotherm, was calculated to be 0.25 +/- 0.06 microM, corresponding to pH 6.6 +/- 0.1. The H+ attenuation of NMDA current was voltage independent at membrane potentials -60 to +30 mV. 4. H+ antagonism of responses to NMDA was reduced when the NMDA concentration was lowered. In the pH range 6.3-8.3 the H(+)-induced reduction did not vary with the concentration of glycine or Mg2+. The sensitivity of NMDA current to Zn2+ was unchanged in the pH range 6.3 +/- 8.0. These results suggest that H+ ions do not directly interfere with the binding of NMDA to its agonist recognition site or with the binding of glycine, Mg2+ and Zn2+ to the specific allosteric sites on the NMDA receptor-channel complex. 5. In outside-out patches held at -60 mV, unitary NMDA-activated currents were recorded at pH 7.3 and 6.3. The mean NMDA single-channel conductance (gamma) obtained for the largest and most frequent openings were: gamma 7.3 = 52.5 +/- 0.8 pS and gamma 6.3 = 51.8 +/- 0.9 pS. The duration of the mean channel open time, tau o, decreased from 4.75 +/- 0.25 ms in the control at pH 7.3 to 3.59 +/- 0.21 ms at pH 6.3. The mean burst duration, tau b, was reduced from 8.51 +/- 0.78 ms at control pH 7.3 to 5.1 +/- 0.34 ms at pH 6.3.

1. The pharmacological and biophysical properties of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were studied using patch electrodes and whole-cell recording from thin slices. 2. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) had a fast component whose amplitude was voltage insensitive and a slow component whose amplitude was voltage dependent with a region of negative slope resistance in the range of -70 to -30 mV. 3. The voltage-dependent component was abolished by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV; 50 microM), which had no effect on the fast component. Conversely, the fast voltage-insensitive component was abolished by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 microM) which had no effect on the slow component. 4. In Ringer solution with no added Mg2+ the current-voltage relation of the NMDA component was linear over a much larger voltage range than in the presence of 1.3 mM-Mg2+. 5. The NMDA component of the EPSC could be switched off with a hyperpolarizing voltage step at the soma. The kinetics of this switch-off was used to estimate the speed of clamp control of the subsynaptic membrane as well as the electrotonic distance from the soma. The kinetic analysis of the EPSC was restricted to synapses which were judged to be under adequate voltage control. 6. For those synapses that were close to the soma the time constant for decay for the non-NMDA component, which was voltage insensitive, ranged from 4-8 ms. 7. The rise time for the NMDA component was 8-20 ms and the time constant for decay ranged from 60-150 ms. 8. During increased transmitter release with post-tetanic potentiation or application or phorbol esters, both components of the EPSC increased to a similar extent. 9. These experiments provide a detailed description of the dual receptor mechanism operating at hippocampal excitatory synapses. In addition, the experiments provide an electrophysiological method for estimating the electrotonic distance of synaptic inputs.

1. The involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the response to single-shock (0.033 Hz) stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway in hippocampal slices has been investigated using current- and voltage-clamp techniques. 2. In the presence of Mg2+ (1 or 2 mM) at membrane potentials near rest, the selective NMDA antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) had no effect on the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the biphasic inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) evoked by Schaffer collateral-commissural stimulation. The recurrent IPSP evoked by antidromic stimulation of alvear fibres was also unaffected by APV. 3. The introduction of a Mg2+-free perfusate led, at high stimulus intensity, to an orthodromically evoked epileptiform discharge but little change in the recurrent IPSP. APV suppressed a large proportion of the enhanced response in Mg2+-free perfusate. 4. EPSPs and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in Mg2+-free perfusate invariably had both APV-resistant and APV-sensitive components. Both synaptic components had similar thresholds and latencies to onset. The APV-sensitive component had a long time to peak and long duration. 5. Under current-clamp conditions in Mg2+-containing medium, an APV-sensitive component was recorded at membrane potentials of between -30 and -10 mV, but not at potentials more negative than -55 mV. 6. Under voltage-clamp, but not current-clamp, conditions in Mg2+-containing medium, a small APV-sensitive component was recorded at resting membrane potentials and increased with membrane depolarization. The difference between the current- and voltage-clamp data is attributed to the hyperpolarizing influence of conjointly activated IPSPs. 7. In the presence of Mg2+ and picrotoxin, a dual-component EPSC was recorded between -30 and +30 mV in all cells examined. The APV-resistant and APV-sensitive components had similar latencies to onset. They both had reversal potentials of between -8 and 0 mV. The APV-sensitive component had a longer latency to peak and duration than the APV-resistant component. 8. It is suggested that NMDA receptors can contribute a low-threshold and long-duration monosynaptic component of the response evoked by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. However, under physiological conditions significant expression of this component is prevented by concurrently activated IPSPs which rapidly hyperpolarize neurones into a region where Mg2+ substantially blocks NMDA channels.

1. Responses to the excitatory amino acids kainate, quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), L-glutamate and L-aspartate were recorded in mouse hippocampal neurones in cell culture, using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Agonists were applied rapidly from an array of flow pipes each of 250 microns diameter, positioned within 100 microns of the nerve cell body. 2. Responses to NMDA, L-aspartate and to low concentrations of L-glutamate, recorded with glycine in the extracellular fluid, were strongly antagonized by 50 microM-zinc. Responses to kainate, quisqualate, and in glycine-free solution, responses to L-glutamate, were potentiated by 50 microM-zinc, but partially antagonized by 1 mM-zinc. On average, with 50 microM-zinc, responses to NMDA were reduced to 0.19 times control, while responses to kainate and quisqualate were increased to 1.09 and 1.14 times control. With 1 mM-zinc responses to kainate and quisqualate were reduced to 0.54 and 0.42 times control. 3. Cadmium had a similar, though less potent action, and at 50 microM antagonized responses to NMDA but potentiated responses to kainate and quisqualate. On average, with 50 microM-cadmium, responses to NMDA were reduced to 0.39 times control, while responses to kainate and quisqualate were increased to 1.08 and 1.15 times control. With 1 mM-cadmium responses to NMDA were reduced to 0.04 times control while responses to kainate and quisqualate were reduced to 0.79 and 0.60 times control. Mercury was neurotoxic and increased the leakage current; however, no reduction of the response to NMDA was produced by 5 microM-mercury. 4. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for zinc antagonism of responses to NMDA, estimated from fit of a single binding site adsorption isotherm, was 13 microM; cadmium was about 4 times less potent than zinc. These effects of zinc and cadmium were nearly voltage independent. In contrast the antagonism of responses to NMDA by 150 microM-magnesium was highly voltage dependent, such that the Kd for magnesium increased e-fold per 17.6 mV depolarization. 5. The potency of zinc as an NMDA antagonist did not vary with the concentration of NMDA, and was not greatly influenced by a 1000-fold variation in the concentration of the NMDA-modulator glycine. This suggests that zinc acts as a non-competitive antagonist, and does not directly interfere with the binding of NMDA to the agonist recognition site nor with the binding of glycine to an allosteric site on the NMDA receptor complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Modulation of excitatory amino acid receptors by group IIB metal cations in cultured mouse hippocampal neurones.

1. Voltage-activated currents have been recorded from cerebellar granule neurones in explant cultures from young rats (1-9 days old). Cells were examined with whole-cell patch-clamp methods. Depolarizing pulses from a pre-pulse potential of -100 mV evoked a rapidly activated transient inward current, and an outward current which decayed in two phases. The ionic dependence, kinetics and pharmacological properties of these currents have been studied. 2. Peak inward Na+ currents in cells from 7-day-old rats were in the range 350-450 pA. No evidence was found for the presence of calcium currents. Thus, inward current was unchanged in zero Ca2+, 1 mM-EGTA solution. No inward current was obtained in medium containing 10 mM-Ba2+ and tetrodotoxin (TTX). Supplementing the pipette (i.e. intracellular) solution with Mg-ATP did not reveal any Ca2+ current. 3. Depolarizing steps (from -100 mV) in TTX-containing solution gave an early transient outward current and a late outward current. The transient current resembled IA described in other cells, and reversed close to EK in both normal and elevated potassium concentrations, indicating that K+ is the predominant charge carrier. Depolarizing steps from -50 mV failed to give a transient outward current, and gave only a slowly rising current which resembled the late potassium current, IK. 4. Inactivation of the transient current was examined by applying test depolarizations from increasingly negative pre-pulse potentials (-50 to -120 mV): half-inactivation occurred at -72 mV. Transient outward currents decayed exponentially with time constants, tau, of 7.3-25.3 ms at 0 mV. The time course of removal of inactivation in cells held at -50 mV, and given increasingly long pre-pulses to -100 mV, was exponential with tau = 35 ms. 5. Both transient and late outward currents were reversibly abolished by addition to the bathing medium of 10 mM-Ba2+ or 1 mM-quinine. Outward K+ current was not dependent on external calcium. Tetraethylammonium (20 mM) selectively reduced the late outward current; the peak transient current was reduced by less than 20%. 4-Aminopyridine (2 mM) showed little selectivity between transient and late outward currents. 6. It is concluded that cerebellar granule cells from young rats possess voltage-activated inward Na+ current as well as two types of K+ current, IA and IK. In terms of neuronal functioning, the properties of the transient outward current may confer a role in regulating excitability and in repolarization, but a definitive statement will require knowledge of the cellular location and relative densities of channels in granule cells in vivo.

1. The whole-cell patch clamp recording technique was employed to investigate the intracellular regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in cultured murine hippocampal neurones. Excitatory amino acids were repeatedly applied at regular intervals during intracellular dialysis with solutions of various composition. 2. Currents evoked by L-aspartate, an agonist of NMDA receptors, gradually 'washed out' to approximately 50% of their initial amplitude during dialysis with an intracellular solution containing CsCl and EGTA as a calcium buffer. In contrast, responses to kainate did not wash out. The wash-out of L-aspartate currents followed an exponential time course with a time constant of about 150 s. Wash-out did not appear to be related to desensitization of NMDA receptors. 3. Following wash-out, L-aspartate responses were blocked by Mg2+, ketamine or D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate indicating that these responses were still mediated by NMDA receptors. Furthermore, responses to NMDA itself showed wash-out to the same extent and with a time course similar to that for L-aspartate responses. 4. Neither the time course nor the extent of the wash-out of responses to L-aspartate was affected when the Ca2+ concentration of the dialysate was varied from zero to 1.5 x 10(-5) M. In addition, wash-out was unaffected by substitution of BAPTA for EGTA, indicating that wash-out was not a consequence of changes in intracellular pH related to the binding of Ca2+ to the buffer or to the kinetics of this binding. Therefore, the wash-out of NMDA currents could not be attributed to a gradual elevation of the concentration of intracellular Ca2+. 5. The extent of the wash-out of L-aspartate currents was similar for cells held at +40 versus -60 mV although the rate of wash-out was slower at the depolarized potential. In addition, the reversal potential of these currents was not altered, demonstrating that a change in driving force did not account for a component of the wash-out. 6. Inclusion of an ATP regeneration solution (Forscher & Oxford, 1985) in the dialysate prevented the wash-out of L-aspartate currents. ATP alone was less effective in preventing wash-out whereas phosphocreatine and creatine phosphokinase were ineffective by themselves. Wash-out also occurred when ATP was replaced with the non-hydrolysable analogue, beta, gamma-methyleneATP, or with GTP. In cells where wash-out of L-aspartate currents had been established, subsequent dialysis with the ATP regenerating solution partially reversed this wash-out.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors revealed by intracellular dialysis of murine neurones in culture.

Fast monosynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials between spinal cord neurones in cell culture (s.c.-s.c. e.p.s.p.s) were studied with current-clamp and two-electrode voltage-clamp methods. The reversal potential, response to acidic amino acid antagonists, and behaviour of the synaptic current were examined. The amplitude of the e.p.s.p. increased with membrane potential hyperpolarization and decreased with depolarization. The reversal potential of the e.p.s.p. was +3.8 +/- 2.5 mV (mean +/- S.E. of mean). The reversal potential for responses to ionophoretically applied L-glutamate and L-aspartate was also near 0 mV. The acidic amino acid antagonist, cis-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA, 0.25-1.0 mM) reversibly antagonized the monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s as well as responses to kainate (KA) or quisqualate (QA). The selective N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, (+/-) 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), had little effect on either the monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s or responses to QA or KA at concentrations that abolished responses to L-aspartate. Under voltage clamp, the peak synaptic current (e.p.s.c.) was linearly related to the membrane potential, increasing in amplitude with hyperpolarization and decreasing with depolarization from the resting potential. The decay of a somatic e.p.s.c. was well fitted by a single exponential function with a time constant of 0.6 ms at 25 degrees C. E.p.s.c.s which had proximal dendritic locations had decay time constants of 1-2 ms. The decay time constant was voltage-insensitive between -80 and +10 mV. We suggest that an acidic amino acid receptor other than that for NMDA mediates excitatory transmission at the s.c.-s.c. synapse; and that the underlying conductance mechanism is voltage insensitive with an estimated mean channel lifetime of less than 1 ms.

In isolated slices of rat cerebral cortex, intracellular recordings were obtained from pyramidal cells that were predominantly in layers II/III. These cells could be antidromically activated from the underlying white matter and had resting potentials of greater than -75 mV, action potentials with amplitudes of greater than 70 mV (measured from threshold), overshoots of 20-30 mV, and thresholds 20-30 mV positive to the resting potential. The responses of these cells to short (1-2 s) pulses of electrophoretically applied N-methylaspartate (NMA) decreased in amplitude with membrane hyperpolarization between -40 and -120 mV, and were associated with an apparent increase in membrane resistance when recorded in the presence of 1 mM-Mg2+. However, in the absence of Mg2+, responses to NMA increased progressively in amplitude with hyperpolarization and were associated with a decrease in membrane resistance. In addition to conventional excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s), electrical stimulation of the underlying white matter evoked a novel e.p.s.p. This e.p.s.p. displayed a similar voltage relation to the response evoked by NMA and was associated with an apparent increase in membrane resistance. When Mg2+ was removed from the bathing medium, the properties of the novel e.p.s.p. changed, and it displayed a conventional voltage relation and was associated with a decrease in membrane resistance. In the absence of Mg2+, novel e.p.s.p.s showed potentiation on low frequency repetitive stimulation (0.5-2 Hz). A fully potentiated response could evoke bursts of slow potentials each of which could evoke a burst of fast spikes. In contrast, the more conventional e.p.s.p.s and i.p.s.p.s evoked in pyramidal neurones were unaffected by reducing the Mg2+ concentration from 1.0 to near 0 mM and conventional e.p.s.p.s showed no potentiation on repetitive, low frequency repetition, even after several hours exposure to Mg2+-free medium. The NMA antagonists: 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, ketamine and cyclazocine, applied electrophoretically at doses that blocked responses to NMA, but which had little effect on responses to glutamate, blocked the novel e.p.s.p. and its potentiation.

The responses of granule cells to glutamate, aspartate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate and kainate applied by ionophoresis on to their dendrites in the middle molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were studied with intracellular electrodes using an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. On passive depolarization 75% of the granule cells displayed anomalous rectification, which persisted in the presence of TTX and TEA but was eliminated by Co2+ or the intracellular injection of Cs+. Short ionophoretic applications of all the excitatory amino acids evoked dose-dependent depolarizations that were highly localized: movement of the ionophoretic electrode by as little as 10 microns could substantially change the size of the response. The depolarizations evoked by glutamate, asparatate, quisqualate and kainate were unaffected by TTX and Co2+. The depolarization evoked by NMDA was unaffected by TTX but markedly reduced by Co2+. Following intracellular injection of Cs+, neurones could be depolarized to +30 mV and the depolarizations produced by glutamate, quisqualate, NMDA and kainate reversed. The reversal potentials (E) were Eglutamate: -5.6 +/- 0.4 mV; ENMDA: 1.8 +/- 1.9 mV; Equisqualate: -3.9 +/- 1.9 mV; Ekainate: -4.6 +/- 2.0 mV. The excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) evoked by stimulation of the medial perforant path could also be reversed and Ee.p.s.p. was -5.5 +/- 1.1 mV. The 6 mV difference between ENMDA and the equilibrium potential for the other exogenously applied excitatory amino acids and the statistically significant difference between ENMDA and Ee.p.s.p. (P less than 0.005; d.f.: 7) is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that both the transmitter released by the medial perforant path and exogenously applied glutamate are unlikely to interact with NMDA receptors.

Membrane currents were recorded from voltage-clamped, EGTA-loaded muscle fibres under conditions where currents through ordinary Na+, K+ and Cl- channels were prevented by drugs or by absence of permeant ions (K+, and Cl-). At 10 mM-external [Ca2+], substitution of Na+ for the large and presumably impermeant organic cations tetramethyl- (TMA+) or tetraethylammonium (TEA+) failed to increase peak inward current. Hence the Ca2+ channel was not significantly permeable to Na+ under these conditions. When external [Ca2+] was reduced to levels below 1 microM in the presence of external Na+, step depolarizations to negative potentials produced tetrodotoxin-resistant inward currents. At -20 mV, they rose to a peak of 30-200 microA/cm2 within 150 ms and declined thereafter. Ca2+ and several other divalent cations reversibly blocked this inward current. The sequence of blocking potencies was Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than or equal to Co2+ greater than Mn2+ congruent to Cd2+ greater than Ni2+ congruent to Mg2+. Large inward currents may be carried by Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ but not by TMA+ and TEA+. The effect of external Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o) was explored over a 10(8)-fold range in concentrations. Na+ was present at a fixed concentration. When [Ca2+]o was gradually increased from 10(-10) to 10(-2) M, inward current first diminished 10-fold, reached a minimum at [Ca2+]o = 60 microM and then increased again as [Ca2+]o was increased further and Ca2+ itself became a current carrier. Block of inward current at [Ca2+]o less than 10(-5) M could be described by binding of a single Ca2+ to a site, with a dissociation constant of the order of 0.7 microM at -20 mV.

Voltage-clamp studies were carried out to compare currents through Ca2+ channels (ICa) with Na+ currents (Ins) through a non-selective cation conductance blocked by micromolar concentrations of external Ca2+. The gating of both currents was found to have similar time and voltage dependence. The amplitudes of ICa and Ins varied widely, but Ins was always large in fibres with large ICa, and small in fibres with small ICa. Both ICa and Ins were blocked by the specific Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, with half-blockage concentrations that were virtually identical (KD = 0.9 microM for ICa and 0.7 microM for Ins). ICa and Ins were also equally sensitive to block by diltiazem (KD = 80 microM). These parallels between Ins and ICa are most easily explained if Ins flows through Ca2+ channels. Apparently, Ca2+ channels bear high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites, and are highly permeable to monovalent cations when Ca2+ is absent. Ba2+ currents (IBa) and ICa were measured in external solutions containing mixtures of Ba2+ and Ca2+. IBa is blocked by Ca2+, as is Ins. Adding Ba2+ to Ca2+ produces only small or no increases in current, as if Ba2+ is only sparingly permeant when Ca2+ is present. Membrane currents in Ba2+/Ca2+ mixtures show anomalous mole-fraction behaviour, suggesting that Ca2+ channels are single-file, multi-ion pores. Complex current transients are observed under maintained depolarizations in Na+/Ca2+ and Ba2+/Ca2+ mixtures. They suggest that in ion mixtures, Ca2+ channels transport Ca2+ in preference to Na+ and Ba2+. Hence Ca2+ channels are selective for Ca2+, even though current amplitudes suggest that the Na+ or Ba2+ permeabilities in the absence of Ca2+ are as high as, or higher than, the Ca2+ permeability. We conclude that the selective permeability of Ca2+ channels depends on the presence of Ca2+. In model calculations, our observations are explained as a consequence of Ca2+ channels being single-file pores. It is proposed that Ca2+ channels derive much of their ion selectivity from high-affinity Ca2+ binding sites located in an otherwise unselective aqueous pore.

Membrane currents and action potentials were recorded in single ventricular cells obtained from guinea-pig hearts by enzymatic dissociation. Ca2+ channel currents carried by Ba2+ or Ca2+ were recorded with a suction pipette (5-10 microns diameter) for voltage clamp and internal dialysis. Currents through Na+, K+ and non-selective monovalent cation channels were suppressed by suitable holding potentials and external and internal solutions. The dialysis method allowed exchange within minutes of alkali metal cations (e.g. Cs+) and small molecules (e.g. quaternary derivatives of lidocaine and verapamil). Nevertheless, Ca2+ channels remained functional for considerable periods, typically 20 min and sometimes more than 1 h. With Ba2+ outside and Cs+ inside, current flow through Ca2+ channels changed from inward to outward at strongly positive levels beyond a clear-cut reversal potential Erev. Several methods for defining Erev were in close agreement: (1) zero-crossing of leak-subtracted peak current, (2) inversion of time-dependent current changes during channel activation or inactivation, (3) inversion of drug-sensitive current as defined by channel blockers such as Cd2+ or D-600. Erev varied with external Ba2+ or internal Cs+. Erev increased by 29 mV per 10-fold increase in Ba2+. Interpreted with constant-field theory, Erev values correspond to PBa/PCs of approximately 1360. With 5 mM-Ca2+ outside and 151 mM-Cs+ inside, Ca2+ channel current reversed near + 75 mV, corresponding to PCa/PCs approximately 6000. Earlier measurements of Erev (Lee & Tsien, 1982) suggest that PCa/PK greater than 1000. At strongly positive membrane potentials where channel activation is maximal, the Ca2+ channel current-voltage relationship is strongly non-linear, with conductance increasing on either side of an inflexion point near Erev. Activation of inward or outward currents through Ca2+ channels follows a sigmoid time course, as expected if activation were a multi-step process.

1. The Ca2+ influx occurring across the post-synaptic membrane during transmitter action was studied at the frog neuromuscular junction, using the Ca sensitive dye arsenazo III to monitor the resulting changes in free myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. 2. Calibration experiments showed a linear relationship between the amount of Ca2+ injected by ionophoresis into a muscle fibre, and the peak size of the arsenazo light absorbance record. 3. Ionophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) to voltage clamped end-plates gave rise to an arsenazo signal. The size of this response varied with the Ca2+ concentration in the bathing solution. 4. The arsenazo light response increased in size steeply, and non-linearly, with hyperpolarization of the end-plate membrane, even when the end-plate current increased approximately linearly with hyperpolarization. The voltage dependence of the light response could be fitted well by an exponential with a voltage constant of 28 mV. Changes in Ca2+ concentration of the bathing medium had little effect on this relationship. 5. At end-plates bathed in isotonic CaCl2 solution the voltage dependence of both the arsenazo light response, and the end-plate current showed a closely similar, non-linear relationship. 6. Addition of 12 mM-Co2+ to a bathing solution initially containing 12 mM-Ca2+ substantially reduced the size of the arsenazo light response, and the voltage dependence of this response became more linear. 7. Arsenazo light responses were also recorded in response to transmitter release evoked by nerve stimulation. The size of the nerve evoked light response showed a non-linear voltage dependence, whilst the end-plate current was a linear function of membrane potential.

Changes in free calcium were monitored in the post-synaptic axon of the giant synapse of the squid, using the calcium indicators aequorin and Arsenazo III. The peak size of the calcium-dependent optical signals recorded from aequorin and Arsenazo III both showed a linear relation with the amount of calcium injected ionophoretically into the axon, but the Arsenazo signal had a slower time course than the aequorin. Ionophoretic application of glutamate to the post-synaptic axon depolarized the axon and caused a rise in intracellular free calcium. Aequorin signals were detected in natural sea water, and their size increased when the calcium concentration in the sea water was raised. Arsenazo signals could be detected only in high-calcium (55 mM) sea water. Intracellular calcium signals were detected also during bath application of several glutamate analogues, including kainate, ibotenate, and aspartate. The peak amplitude of the intracellular calcium signal, monitored with both indicators, increased with increasing ionophoretic glutamate dose, and varied linearly with the integral of the glutamate-induced membrane depolarization. No calcium signals were detected when depolarizations, similar to those produced by glutamate, were induced by current injection in the absence of glutamate. We conclude that glutamate increases the calcium permeability of the post-synaptic membrane, independently of the glutamate-induced depolarization. The glutamate-induced depolarization and the rise in intracellular free calcium increased roughly linearly as the membrane potential was made more negative. Extrapolation of these data indicated that the glutamate depolarization would reduce to zero at about -30 mV, while the calcium signals would be suppressed at about +50 mV.

The resting membrane of a barnacle muscle fiber is mostly permeable to cations in a solution of pH 7.7 whereas it becomes primarily permeable to anions if the pH is below 4.0. Mechanisms of ion permeation for various monovalent cations and anions were investigated at pH 7.7 and 3.9, respectively. Permeability ratios were obtained from the relationship between the membrane potential and the concentration of the test ions, and ionic conductances from current-voltage relations of the membrane. The permeability sequence for anions (SCN > I > NO3 > Br > ClO3 > Cl > BrO3 > IO3) was different from the conductance sequence for anions (Br, Cl > ClO3, NO3 > SCN). In contrast, the permeability and conductance sequences were identical for cations (K > Rb > Cs > Na > Li). The results suggest that anion permeation is governed by membrane charges while cation permeation is via some electrically neutral mechanism.

1. The ion-selective and ion transport properties of glycine receptor (GlyR) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) channels in the soma membrane of mouse spinal cord neurones were investigated using the whole-cell, cell-attached and outside-out patch versions of the patch-clamp technique. 2. Current-voltage (I-V) relations of transmitter-activated currents obtained from whole-cell measurements with 145 mM-Cl- intracellularly and extracellularly, showed outward rectification. In voltage-jump experiments, the instantaneous I-V relations were linear, and the steady-state I-V relations were rectifying outwardly indicating that the gating of GlyR and GABAR channels is voltage sensitive. 3. The reversal potential of whole-cell currents shifted 56 mV per tenfold change in internal Cl- activity indicating activation of Cl(-)-selective channels. The permeability ratio of K+ to Cl- (PK/PCl) was smaller than 0.05 for both channels. 4. The permeability sequence for large polyatomic anions was formate greater than bicarbonate greater than acetate greater than phosphate greater than propionate for GABAR channels; phosphate and propionate were not measurably permeant in GlyR channels. This indicates that open GlyR and GABAR channels have effective pore diameters of 5.2 and 5.6 A, respectively. The sequence of relative permeabilities for small anions was SCN- greater than I- greater than Br- greater than Cl- greater than F- for both channels. 5. GlyR and GABAR channels are multi-conductance-state channels. In cell-attached patches the single-channel slope conductances close to 0 mV membrane potential were 29, 18 and 10 pS for glycine, and 28, 17 and 10 pS for GABA-activated channels. The most frequently observed (main) conductance states were 29 and 17 pS for the GlyR and GABAR channel, respectively. 6. In outside-out patches with equal extracellular and intracellular concentrations of 145 mM-Cl-, the conductance states were 46, 30, 20 and 12 pS for GlyR channels and 44, 30, 19 and 12 pS for GABAR channels. The most frequently occurring main state was 46 pS for the GlyR and 30 pS for the GABAR channel. 7. Single-channel conductances measured in equal 140 mM concentrations of small anions on both membrane faces revealed a conductance sequence of Cl- greater than Br- greater than I- greater than SCN- greater than F- for both channels. This is nearly the inverse sequence of that found for the permeability of these ions indicating the presence of binding sites for ions in the channel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Mechanism of anion permeation through channels gated by glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in mouse cultured spinal neurones.

1. Membrane noise and current changes produced by glutamate and related excitatory amino acids have been examined in cultured large cerebellar neurones (including Purkinje cells), with whole-cell patch-clamp methods. The sensitivity of these neurones to the inhibitory amino acids gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine has also been studied. 2. The neurones formed inhibitory synapses in culture, and displayed spontaneous synaptic currents. Reducing the pipette Cl- concentration (i.e. intracellular synaptic currents. Reducing the pipette Cl- concentration (i.e. intracellular concentration) caused a negative shift in their reversal potential, and the currents could be blocked with bicuculline (10 microM), suggesting that they were mediated by GABAA receptors. Spontaneous synaptic activity was also considerably reduced in the presence of 3 microM-tetrodotoxin. 3. Analysis of the increase in whole-cell current noise produced by the application of GABA (3 microM) gave noise spectra that were fitted by two Lorentzian components with slow and fast time constants of 23.6 and 1.9 ms at a membrane potential (Vm) of -110 mV. The mean single-channel conductance estimated from GABA noise was gamma noise = 12 pS. Glycine (10 microM) whole-cell current responses were Cl(-)-mediated and reversibly abolished by 1 microM-strychnine. 4. Bath application of excitatory amino acids gave whole-cell current changes accompanied by an increase in synaptic activity. Postsynaptic responses to the excitatory amino acids were more readily seen after the inhibitory synaptic currents had been abolished by bicuculline. Membrane current changes were obtained in response to the putative transmitters glutamate and aspartate, and the agonists NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), ibotenate, quisqualate and kainate. Their reversal potential was approximately -5 mV. 5. A majority of noise spectra produced by the various glutamate receptor agonists were fitted by two Lorentzian components; the rest were fitted with a single Lorentzian component. The noise time constants were apparently not dependent on the type of glutamate agonist used to activate the receptor channels. Pooling data for all agonists gave a mean time constant for single-component spectra of tau noise = 4.8 +/- 0.3 ms; for two-component spectra the time constants were tau 1 = 22.7 +/- 1.8 ms and tau 2 = 2.2 +/- 0.12 ms (Vm = -110 to -50 mV). It is likely that the two components present in whole-cell noise spectra reflect complex kinetics of glutamate receptor channels. 6. The mean single-channel conductance was estimated from whole-cell noise for the various excitatory amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Whole-cell current noise produced by excitatory and inhibitory amino acids in large cerebellar neurones of the rat.

Whole-cell and single-channel recording techniques were used to study the action of the anticonvulsant drug MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]- cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate) on responses to excitatory amino acids in rat neocortical neurons in cell culture. MK-801 caused a progressive, long-lasting blockade of current induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp). However, during the time that N-Me-D-Asp responses were inhibited, there was no effect on responses to quisqualate or kainate, suggesting that N-Me-D-Asp receptors and kainate/quisqualate receptors open separate populations of ion channels. Binding and unbinding of MK-801 seems to be possible only if the N-Me-D-Asp-operated channel is in the transmitter-activated state: MK-801 was effective only when applied simultaneously with N-Me-D-Asp, and recovery from MK-801 blockade was speeded by continuous exposure to N-Me-D-Asp [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 90 min at -70 to -80 mV]. Recovery from block during continuous application of N-Me-D-Asp was strongly voltage dependent, being faster at positive potentials (tau approximately equal to 2 min at +30 mV). Mg2+, which is thought to block the N-Me-D-Asp-activated ion channel, inhibited blockade by MK-801 at negative membrane potentials. In single-channel recordings from outside-out patches. MK-801 greatly reduced the channel activity elicited by application of N-Me-D-Asp but did not significantly alter the predominant unitary conductance. Consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism, the mean channel open time was reduced by MK-801 in a dose-dependent manner.

We further investigated the rapid fluctuations between two different conductance levels promoted by protons when monovalent ions carry current through single L-type Ca channels. We tested for voltage dependence of the proton-induced current fluctuations and for accessibility of the protonation site from both sides of the membrane patch. The results strongly suggest an extracellular location of the protonation site. We also studied the dependence of the kinetics of the fluctuations and of the two conductance levels on the concentration of permeant ion and on external ionic strength. We find that saturation curves of channel conductance vs. [K] are similar for the two conductance levels. This provides evidence that protonation does not appreciably change the surface potential near the entry of the permeation pathway. The proton-induced conduction change must therefore result from an indirect interaction between the protonation site and the ion-conducting pathway. Concentration of permeant ion and ionic strength also affect the kinetics of the current fluctuations, in a manner consistent with our previous hypothesis that channel occupancy destabilizes the low conductance channel conformation. We show that the absence of measurable fluctuations with Li and Ba as charge carriers can be explained by significantly higher affinities of these ions for permeation sites. Low concentrations of Li reduce the Na conductance and abbreviate the lifetimes of the low conductance level seen in the presence of Na. We use whole-cell recordings to extrapolate our findings to the physiological conditions of Ca channel permeation and conclude that in the presence of 1.8 mM Ca no proton-induced fluctuations occur between pH 7.5 and 6.5. Finally, we propose a possible physical interpretation of the formal model of the protonation cycle introduced in the companion paper.

1. Using the radioligand [3H]-MK801, we have examined drug interactions with the phencyclidine recognition site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. 2. The tricyclic antidepressants desmethylimipramine and imipramine inhibited [3H]-MK801 binding with IC50 values of 7.4 and 22.5 microM, respectively. Other related tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics were also effective but less potent. 3. Desmethylimipramine, imipramine and chlorimipramine slowed the dissociation rate of [3H]-MK801 in a similar manner to Zn2+. Phencyclidine and related compounds had no effect on the dissociation rate of [3H]-MK801. 4. Desmethylimipramine, imipramine and ketamine also prevented the Ca2+ influx into cultured cortical neurones of the rat produced by N-methyl-D-aspartate. 5. As the actions of tricyclic antidepressants in this system are not competitive with respect to N-methyl-D-aspartate, glycine or MK-801, and as they slow the dissociation of [3H]-MK801, we conclude that tricyclic antidepressants may be acting at the Zn2+ recognition site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

Many hormonal, neurotransmitter, and sensory stimuli trigger the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn releases calcium from intracellular stores. We report here that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release from saponin-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells at 37 degrees C is markedly biphasic, in contrast with nearly monophasic release kinetics at 11 degrees C. Hepatoma, PC-12 neuronal cells, and several other cell types exhibit similar biphasic release at 37 degrees C. The biphasic kinetics are not due to degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or to increased Ca2(+)-ATPase pump activity. Biphasic calcium release was also seen when ATP was quenched to less than 0.4 microM by adding hexokinase and glucose, suggesting that phosphorylation is not involved. External calcium (100 nM-600 nM) range had little influence on the biphasic kinetics. Rapid-mixing experiments revealed that rapid efflux of calcium is followed in approximately 0.5 s by a 30-fold slower efflux. Most striking, successive additions of the same amount of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced short bursts of calcium release of similar size. This retention of responsiveness, which we term increment detection, may be a distinct mode of signal transduction. Like inactivation and adaptation, increment detection gives rise to transient responses to sustained stimuli. Systems exhibiting inactivation, adaptation, and increment detection differ in their responsiveness (none, partial, and full, respectively) to stepwise increases in stimulus intensity. Increment detection could be advantageous in generating receptor-triggered calcium oscillations.Images	Transient calcium release induced by successive increments of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

An explanation of the complex effects of hormones on intracellular Ca2+ requires that the intracellular actions of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the relationships between intracellular Ca2+ stores are fully understood. We have examined the kinetics of 45Ca2+ efflux from pre-loaded intracellular stores after stimulation with Ins(1,4,5)P3 or the stable phosphorothioate analogue, Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3, by simultaneous addition of one of them with glucose/hexokinase to rapidly deplete the medium of ATP. Under these conditions, a maximal concentration of either Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 evoked rapid efflux of about half of the accumulated 45Ca2+, and thereafter the efflux was the same as occurred under control conditions. Submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 caused a smaller rapid initial efflux of 45Ca2+, after which the efflux was similar whatever the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 present. The failure of submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 to mobilize fully the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ stores despite prolonged incubation was not due either to inactivation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or to desensitization of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. The results suggest that the size of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitive Ca2+ stores depends upon the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3.

1. Extra- and intracellular responses of single units in the inferior olive following stimulation of the cerebellum, limb nerves, skin receptors, the caudate nucleus and cerebral cortex have been described.2. Responses following cerebellar stimulation were assumed to be antidromic spikes when they occurred after a latency of less than 4 msec and followed stimulus frequencies greater than 220/sec. Other responses with longer latencies were thought to be transynaptic. Evidence for recurrent inhibition of the Renshaw type is given.3. Following limb nerve stimulation two types of units have been observed; units responding after a short latency and to stimulation of one limb only and units responding with a long latency following stimulation of one or more of the limbs.4. Units responding to stimulation of the limb nerve after a short latency could often be excited by hair movement and/or light touch on the pads. Other units were excited by pinching and others could not be excited by a physiological stimulus. The receptive field of these units was small and there was no evidence of fringe inhibition.5. Most units observed represented the contralateral forelimb but there was a significant number of units representing the ipsilateral limbs.6. The caudato-olivary pathway has been shown to be excitatory. Short latency limb units do not receive afferents from the caudate nucleus.7. Afferents from the motor cortex excite units in the inferior olive. A remarkable correlation of latencies of responses from both the cerebral cortex and the limbs on to individual units has been described.8. The results suggest a complex organization of neurones within the inferior olive. A possible plan of the organization of neurones is given and discussed.

1 In cats, anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, intravenous diazepam (minimum dose 3.0 mg/kg) enhanced dorsal root potentials but did not significantly diminish the reduction by electrophoretic strychnine of the inhibitory action of electrophoretic glycine on dorsal horn interneurones. 2 In mice, intraperitoneal diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) had no appreciable effect on the potency of strychnine as a convulsant, although providing some protection against bicuculline. 3 These observations, together with the failure of chlordiazepoxide to either inhibit the firing of spinal interneurones or reduce antagonism between strychnine and glycine when administered locally, provide no support for the interaction between benzodiazepines and mammalian central glycine receptors which has been proposed on the basis of in vitro studies of strychnine binding.

The perhydro derivative of histrionicotoxin reversibly blocks the excitatory ionic transduction system in the synaptic and sarcolemmal membranes of mammalian skeletal muscle cells. The efficacy of perhydrohistrionicotoxin as an antagonist at the post-synaptic membrane is increased by the transient presence of acetylcholine in the endplate of innervated muscles and at extrajunctional receptors in denervated muscles. α-Bungarotoxin and [3H]monoacetyl-α-bungarotoxin block the endplate acetylcholine receptors, each binding to the same extent. The effect of bungarotoxin is partially reversible. These electrophysiological results, together with the effects of perhydrohistrionicotoxin and/or d-tubocurarine on the binding of [3H]monoacetyl-α-bungarotoxin at endplates of murine diaphragm muscle and on the bungarotoxin-elicited irreversible blockade of neuromuscular transmission, suggest that at least two types of sites participate in the synaptic excitation by acetylcholine. One site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and by curare, is presumably the acetylcholine receptor. Binding of bungarotoxin at this site is responsible for an irreversible blockade of neuromuscular transmission. The second site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and perhydrohistrionicotoxin, is proposed to be part of the cholinergic ion conductance modulator. Binding of bungarotoxin to this site does not result in an irreversible blockade.Images	Acetylcholine Receptor and Ion Conductance Modulator Sites at the Murine Neuromuscular Junction: Evidence from Specific Toxin Reactions	Edson X.

Interaction of 21 benzodiazepines with the glycine receptor in the brainstem and spinal cord of rat have been evaluated in terms of their displacement of [3H]strychinine binding. The rank order of potency of the 21 drugs in displacing specific [3H]strychinine binding correlates (p < 0.005) with their rank order of potency in a vareity of pharmacological and behavioral tests in humans and animals that predict clinical efficacy. There is a 50-fold variation in potency of the series of benzodiazepines with mean effective dose (ED50) values ranging from 19μM to > 1000 μM. Diazepam (Valium®) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium®) have ED50's of 26 μM and 200 μM, respectively, whereas the ED50 for glycine is 25 μM. The inhibitory effects of 10 of the agents in two other central nervous system membrane receptor assays, for the opiate receptor and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, do not correlate with any of the in vivo pharmacologic and behavioral tests. The benzodiazepines may exert their antianxiety, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effects by mimicking the effects of the neurotransmitter glycine at its central nervous system receptor sites.

1. Intracellular aequorin was used to monitor changes in Ca entry in response to maintained depolarization either produced electrically or by exposure to K-rich solutions.2. External K concentrations greater than 50 mM produce a phasic light response. The light rises to a peak in a few sec and then falls in 0·5-5 min to a new steady level that is always greater than the level in the absence of K.3. The phasic light response does not result from depletion of available aequorin at the periphery of the axon, but rather seems to reflect a phasic entry of Ca in response to depolarization.4. Similar phasic responses are produced by prolonged electrical depolarization. These results are consistent with depolarization serving both to activate and also to inactivate Ca entry.5. Following inactivation and after return to normal sea-water, there is an appreciable relative refractory period during which the response both to K-rich sea-water and electrical depolarization is reduced in size. Complete recovery takes 10-15 min.6. The response to 410 mM-KCl is dependent on the previous treatment of the preparation. Pre-treatment with 100 or 200 mM-KCl reduced the response to 410 mM-KCl. The potential for half inactivation was about -25 mV in 112 mM-Ca and -40 mV in 20 mM-Ca.7. The rate of onset of inactivation is potential dependent and is faster for depolarizations to zero potential than for smaller ones.8. The phasic Ca entry produced by K-rich solutions is insensitive to external tetrodotoxin and internal tetraethylammonium ions, but is blocked by external Mn2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ ions and by the drugs D-600 and iproveratril. This suggests that the phasic Ca entry involves the late Ca channel.9. Recovery of the outward K current after a long depolarization is much faster than recovery of the late Ca entry system. This provides further support for the view that the late Ca channel and the K channel are distinct.	Calcium entry in response to maintained depolarization of squid axons	P. F. Baker, H. Meves, E. B.

1. The Ca-sensitive photoprotein aequorin was injected into squid axons and the light response to stimulation or depolarizing voltage clamp pulses recorded.2. The effects of Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, La3+ and of the organic Ca antagonists D-600 and iproveratril on the early tetrodotoxin-sensitive and late tetrodotoxin-insensitive components of the light response were studied.3. The late tetrodotoxin-insensitive component can be blocked, reversibly, by concentrations of Mn, Co and Ni that reduce but do not block the tetrodotoxin-sensitive component. The late component can also be blocked by La3+ and the organic Ca antagonists D-600 and iproveratril.4. Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and the drug D-600 all reduce the Na currents, but have little effect on either outward or inward K currents. Tetraethylammonium blocks the outward K current but has no appreciable effect on the tetrodotoxin-insensitive entry of Ca.5. Concentrations of Mn between 5 and 50 mM substantially reduce the light output during a train of action potentials; they also slightly reduce the rate of rise of the action potential.6. On pharmacological grounds it is concluded that the tetrodotoxin-insensitive component of Ca entry does not represent Ca ions passing through the K permeability channels. There must exist a potential-dependent late Ca channel that is distinct from the well known Na and K channels of the action potential. A possible function for this late Ca channel in the coupling of excitation to secretion is discussed.

1. The influence of internal and external Na concentrations on Ca movements have been measured in pinch-off presynaptic nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Ca uptake is enhanced when external Na (Nao) is replaced by Li, choline or dextrose, in Na-loaded synaptosomes. Depletion of internal Na (Nai) abolishes the stimulatory effect of external Na removal. 2. Ca uptake from Na-depleted media is proportional to [Na]i -2, and averages about 1-5 mumole Ca/g synaptosome protein per minute when [Na]i is approximately 137 mM. This may correspond to a Ca influx of about 0-1 p-mole/cm-2 sec. 3. External Na is a competitive inhibitor of the Nai-dependent Ca uptake. The interrelationship between [Na]o, [Ca]o and Ca uptake indicate that two external Na ions may compete with one Ca at each uptake site. 4. The distribution of particles with Nai-dependent Ca uptake activity parallels the distribution of synaptosomes in the preparative sucrose gradient. Thus, this Ca uptake activity is probably a property of the pinched-off nerve terminals per se, and not of the mitochondria which may contaminate the synaptosome fraction. 5. The Nai-dependent Ca uptake mechanism requires an intact surface membrane, since synaptosomes subjected to osmotic lysis lose the ability to accumulate Ca by this route. 6. Ca efflux into Ca-free media is largely dependent upon the presence of external Na. The curve relating Ca efflux to [Na]o is sigmoid, and suggests that more than one external Na ion (perhaps 2 or 3) is needed to activate the efflux of each Ca ion. 7. The net Ca gain exhibited by Na-loaded synaptosomes incubated in Na-depleted media can be accounted for by the increased Ca uptake and decreased Ca loss observed under these conditions. 8. Treatment of synaptosomes with cyanide or 2,4-dinitrophenol decreases Ca uptake and enhances Ca efflux into Na-containing media. This results in a net loss of Ca from the terminals, even in the presence of external Ca. 9. In contrast to the Ca efflux from synaptosomes, the Ca efflux from brain mitochondria is not dependent upon external Na, and is reduced by succinate, a substrate which is known to fuel mitochondrial respiration. 10. The temperature coefficient (Q10) of the Nai-dependent Ca uptake is about 3. 11. The Nai-dependent Ca uptake is reduced at low pH. The relationship between this Ca uptake and pH approximates a titration curve with a pKa of about 5-6. 12. The data indicate that Ca transport in rat brain presynaptic terminals may involve a carrier-mediated Na-Ca exchange mechanism, and that some of the energy required for Ca extrusion may come from the Na electrochemical gradient across the surface membranes.

When the nerves of isolated frog sartorius muscles were stimulated at 10 Hz, synaptic vesicles in the motor nerve terminals became transiently depleted. This depletion apparently resulted from a redistribution rather than disappearance of synaptic vesicle membrane, since the total amount of membrane comprising these nerve terminals remained constant during stimulation. At 1 min of stimulation, the 30% depletion in synaptic vesicle membrane was nearly balanced by an increase in plasma membrane, suggesting that vesicle membrane rapidly moved to the surface as it might if vesicles released their content of transmitter by exocytosis. After 15 min of stimulation, the 60% depletion of synaptic vesicle membrane was largely balanced by the appearance of numerous irregular membrane-walled cisternae inside the terminals, suggesting that vesicle membrane was retrieved from the surface as cisternae. When muscles were rested after 15 min of stimulation, cisternae disappeared and synaptic vesicles reappeared, suggesting that cisternae divided to form new synaptic vesicles so that the original vesicle membrane was now recycled into new synaptic vesicles. When muscles were soaked in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this tracerfirst entered the cisternae which formed during stimulation and then entered a large proportion of the synaptic vesicles which reappeared during rest, strengthening the idea that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface was retrieved as cisternae which subsequently divided to form new vesicles. When muscles containing HRP in synaptic vesicles were washed to remove extracellular HRP and restimulated, HRP disappeared from vesicles without appearing in the new cisternae formed during the second stimulation, confirming that a one-way recycling of synaptic membrane, from the surface through cisternae to new vesicles, was occurring. Coated vesicles apparently represented the actual mechanism for retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasma membrane, because during nerve stimulation they proliferated at regions of the nerve terminals covered by Schwann processes, took up peroxidase, and appeared in various stages of coalescence with cisternae. In contrast, synaptic vesicles did not appear to return directly from the surface to form cisternae, and cisternae themselves never appeared directly connected to the surface. Thus, during stimulation the intracellular compartments of this synapse change shape and take up extracellular protein in a manner which indicates that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface during exocytosis is retrieved by coated vesicles and recycled into new synaptic vesicles by way of intermediate cisternae.

1. Three forms of acetylcholine occur in subcellular fractions of brain tissue: free acetylcholine, present in the high-speed supernatant from eserinized sucrose homogenates; stable bound acetylcholine, present in synaptic vesicles; and labile bound acetylcholine, present in the cytoplasm of synaptosomes (detached presynaptic nerve terminals). 2. The relationship between these forms has been investigated by isolating the subcellular fractions from the cortical tissue of cats and guinea pigs excised 1hr. after infiltration of [N-Me-3H]choline into the cortex in vivo. 3. Since choline is a ubiquitous metabolite, means were devised for isolating the radioactive acetylcholine on columns of the weak acid ion-exchange resin IRF-97; control experiments with samples of extracts treated with acetylcholinesterase showed that the radioactivity attributed to acetylcholine migrated to the choline peak after cholinesterase treatment. 4. The specific radioactivities of the various forms of acetylcholine were different: labile bound (synaptosomal cytoplasmic) acetylcholine had the highest, stable bound (vesicular) acetylcholine the next highest, and the high-speed-supernatant form the lowest. 5. It is concluded that the various forms of acetylcholine could not have arisen during fractionation from a single pre-existing pool of acetylcholine.

1. The redox state of cytochrome c, cytochrome a and the mitochondrial NAD couple, and the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides, were measured in suspensions of isolated rat liver cells. 2. The ΔG for the transfer of two electrons from the mitochondrial NAD to the cytochrome c couple is calculated to be 104kJ (24.8kcal). 3. The ΔG associated with the synthesis of ATP at the measured phosphorylation state is calculated to be 95kJ (22.7kcal)/2mol of ATP. 4. The near equality of ΔG of the electron-transport process and ΔG required for ATP synthesis indicates near-equilibrium between the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the extramitochondrial phosphorylation state. 5. The existence of near-equilibrium in the coupled reactions implies that the respiratory activity depends on the ratio [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] and not on the concentrations of the individual reactants. 6. If the overall system of oxidative phosphorylation is at near-equilibrium, all intermediary reactions must also be at equilibrium. Hence if the intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial phosphorylation states are indeed different, it follows that any differences in the activities of ATP, ADP and Pi must be coupled to ion gradients and/or potentials across the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that translocation occurs without loss of free energy. 7. The metabolic state of the mitochondria in the cell can be defined by the turnover number of the cytochromes, the cytoplasmic phosphorylation state, and the oxidation–reduction potential of the NAD couple, rather than by the availability of ADP, substrate and O2.

1. A method was devised for the determination of the specific radioactivity of the acetyl moiety of acetylcholine synthesized from various 14C-labelled substrates. 2. The precursor for the acetyl moiety of acetylcholine was studied in slices of striatum and cerebral cortex from rat and guinea-pig brain. Incorporation of radioactivity into acetylcholine was determined after incubating the slices in the presence of [2-14C]acetate, [14C]bicarbonate, [1,5-14C]citrate, dl-[1- or 5-14C]glutamate or [1- or 2-14C]pyruvate. 3. After incubation for 1h, acetylcholine was accumulated significantly in both striatum slices (4.1nmol/mg of protein) and cerebral-cortex slices (0.57nmol/mg of protein) from the rat. Final concentrations were about 11 and 5 times respectively the initial values. 4. With slices from rat striatum, rat cerebral cortex and guinea-pig cerebral cortex, the specific radioactivity of acetylcholine derived from [2-14C]pyruvate was very high, reaching approx. 30, 20 and 6% respectively of the initial specific radioactivity of added pyruvate in the medium. With the striatum slices this high value was reached after incubation for 15min. Incorporation of radioactivity from [2-14C]acetate was only 1.25, 5.3 and 19.7% of that from [2-14C]pyruvate in rat striatum, rat cerebral-cortex and guinea-pig cerebral-cortex slices respectively. A small but definite incorporation was found from [5-14C]glutamate. No incorporation was found from the other substrates. The findings suggest that pyruvate is the most important precursor for the synthesis of the acetyl moiety of acetylcholine in brain slices. 5. The specific radioactivity of acetylcholine relative to that of citrate when [2-14C]pyruvate was used compared with that obtained when [2-14C]acetate was used.

1. Exchange of 3H2O with H2O takes place rapidly in incubated rat brain slices but at a lower rate in slices from infant brain than from adult brain. The temperature coefficient (Q10) of the exchange process, between 37 and 4°C, is 1.76 with infant brain and 1.26 with adult brain. The exchange process is unaffected by the presence of ouabain or 2,4-dinitrophenol. 2. An approximately linear relationship exists between water uptake and the concentration of ATP in the incubated slices in the presence of various concentrations of glucose. Little or no change occurs in water uptake and ATP concentration in the presence of a glucose concentration exceeding 3mm. A linear relationship also exists between the water uptake and ATP concentration in the presence of 10mm-glucose and various concentrations of sodium l-glutamate but the line is parallel to that found with changed glucose concentrations and shifted in the direction of increased water uptake. A similar parallel relationship exists between water uptake and ATP concentration in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol, but the amount of water uptake is significantly smaller in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol than in its absence. 3. Copper chloride (0.3mm) or mercuric chloride (0.3mm) both increase water uptake and diminish the ATP concentration in slices. Sodium malonate (2mm) or sodium d-glutamate (10mm) has similar effects. 4. Substances, or conditions, affecting water uptake in incubated brain slices may be divided roughly into two classes in accordance with their effects on adenosine triphosphatase and membrane permeability, but there may be considerable lack of specificity.

1. Under certain conditions the processes that bring about increased Na+ influx and water uptake into rat brain slices have a tetrodotoxin-sensitive component. 2. Incubation of slices in the absence of glucose, or in the presence of ouabain (0.1mm), protoveratrine (10μm) or electrical stimuli, leads to increased uptakes of water and Na+ that are partially suppressed by tetrodotoxin (3μm). 3. The increased water uptake and Na+ influx due to the presence of 30μm-2,4-dinitrophenol or of 100mm-potassium chloride are unaffected by tetrodotoxin. 4. The additional presence of 27mm-potassium chloride diminishes, or abolishes, the inhibitory effects of tetrodotoxin on the increased uptakes of water and Na+ found on incubation in the absence of glucose or in the presence of protoveratrine. 5. Ouabain increases Na+ influx into caudate nuclei from rat brain and this process is suppressed by tetrodotoxin. Ouabain does not increase water uptake in the caudate nuclei. 6. Diminution of Na+ influx in slices due to tetrodotoxin is not accompanied by an equal efflux of K+. 7. It is concluded that glial-cell membranes are permeable to K+ and Cl− and, as a consequence, when K+ is released from neurons in association with action potentials it, together with water, moves into the glial cells. The major consequence of K+ (and Cl−) permeability of the glial cell is therefore a buffering of the extracellular K+ concentration. 8. l-Glutamate presents an anomalous feature that may indicate that its effects are not restricted to neurons. 9. Calculations are made of the increase of K+ flux into the glia in the presence of ouabain or of protoveratrine or in the absence of glucose or on application of electrical impulses.

1. In cats under methoxyflurane, DNP and other metabolic inhibitors were tested on cortical neurones by iontophoresis from micropipettes.2. DNP, dinitro-o-cresol, iodoacetate, pentachlorophenol and oligomycin (uncouplers or inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation), as well as moderate anoxia, blocked selectively and reversibly spontaneous firing and discharges evoked by ACh; responses evoked by glutamate were facilitated by moderate doses of DNP and blocked only by large amounts.3. Azide, cyanide, ouabain and strophanthidine had a mainly excitatory effect; the cardiac glycosides tended to depress more strongly responses to glutamate.4. Intracellular observations showed that DNP causes a sharp fall in electrical excitability, associated with a hyperpolarization and fall in membrane resistance.5. The hyperpolarizing action of DNP had a mean reversal level (EDNP) nearly 30 mV more negative than the resting potential; EDNP was identical with the mean reversal level for the depolarizing action of ACh, measured on the same cells.6. DNP had its usual hyperpolarizing effect on neurones whose IPSPs had been made positive by raising the internal [Cl]; the mean EIPSP was over 30 mV more positive than EDNP.7. It is concluded that DNP lowers excitability by raising the membrane conductance to K+ (gK) and that it blocks ACh responses selectively because ACh has a precisely opposite action on these neurones.8. In the Discussion, it is suggested that the rise in gK is mediated by an increase in internal free Ca2+, caused by a slowing of mitochondrial activity, and that a similar mechanism may play a significant role in general anaesthesia.

1. The muscarinic depolarizing action of ACh on cortical neurones is associated with an increase in membrane resistance (mean ΔV/ΔR = 3·16 mV/MΩ).2. ACh also promotes repetitive firing by slowing repolarization after spikes.3. The depolarizing effect has a mean reversal level of -86·7 mV (with mean resting potential -56 mV).4. It is concluded that as a muscarinic excitatory agent, ACh probably acts by reducing the resting K+ conductance of cortical neurones, and also the delayed K+ current of the action potential.5. These results are discussed in relation to the possible role of ACh in cortical function.	The mechanism of excitation by acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex	K. Krnjevic, R. Pumain, L.

1. Tetrodotoxin, at concentrations at which it abolishes generation of action potentials in the nervous system, enhances by about 300% the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of brain-cortex slices from adult rats, or from adult and infant guinea pigs. This occurs to a greater extent in Ca2+-deficient incubation media than in Ca2+-rich media. Tetrodotoxin has no accelerative effect on cerebral aerobic glycolysis. 2. Tetrodotoxin does not affect the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of 2-day-old rat brain-cortex slices, nor that of adult rat kidney medulla, nor that of an extract of an acetone-dried powder of brain. 3. Tetrodotoxin does not affect the rate of penetration of glucose into brain slices. 4. Its effect is not apparent if it is added 10min or later after the onset of anoxia. 5. Its effect diminishes as the concentration of K+ in the incubation medium is increased while that of Na+ is decreased. 6. Its salient effect, at the onset of anoxia, is to diminish influx of Na+ into, and efflux of K+ from, the brain slices. 7. Substances that promote cerebral influx of Na+, e.g. protoveratrine, sodium l-glutamate, diminish the accelerative action of tetrodotoxin. 8. It is concluded that tetrodotoxin exerts its effect on anaerobic glycolysis by suppressing, at the onset of anoxia, the generation of action potentials and thereby the accompanying influx of Na+ and efflux of K+. It is suggested that glycolytic stimulation occurs because a rate-limiting step, e.g. operation of pyruvate kinase, is stimulated by K+ and depressed by Na+. 9. Local anaesthetics behave in a manner similar to that of tetrodotoxin in enhancing cerebral anaerobic glycolysis. 10. Sodium Amytal has a marked effect at relatively high concentration. 11. Tetrodotoxin diminishes efflux of amino acids, particularly glutamate and aspartate, at the onset of anoxia.

The total activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in mitochondria isolated from rat brain and liver was 53.5 and 14.2nmol/min per mg of protein respectively. Pyruvate dehydrogenase in liver mitochondria incubated for 4 min at 37 degrees C with no additions was 30% in the active form and this activity increased with longer incubations until it was completely in the active form after 20 min. Brain mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was initially high and did not increase with addition of Mg2+ plus Ca2+ or partially purified pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase or with longer incubations. The proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form in both brain and liver mitochondria changed inversely with changes in mitochondrial energy charge, whereas total pyruvate dehydrogenase did not change. The chelators citrate, isocitrate, EDTA, ethanedioxybis(ethylamine)tetra-acetic acid and Ruthenium Red each lowered pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in brain mitochondria, but only citrate and isocitrate did so in liver mitochondria. These chelators did not affect the energy charge of the mitochondria. Mg2+ plus Ca2+ reversed the pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation in liver, but not brain, mitochondria. The regulation of the activation-inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in mitochondria from rat brain and liver with respect to energy charge is similar and may be at least partially regulated by this parameter, and the effects of chelators differ in the two types of mitochondria.

1. The recapture and re-use of choline formed by the hydrolysis of released acetylcholine (ACh) was studied in the superior cervical ganglion of the cat using radioactive tracer techniques. The ganglion's ACh store was labelled by perfusion, during preganglionic nerve stimulation, with Krebs solution containing [3H]choline.2. Preganglionic stimulation (5 Hz for 20 min) of ganglia containing [3H]ACh released similar amounts of radioactivity when perfusion was with neostigmine—choline—Krebs or with hemicholinium—Krebs. This indicated that neostigmine does not increase transmitter release.3. The amount of radioactivity collected from stimulated ganglia during perfusion with choline—Krebs was 39% of the amount of radioactivity collected during perfusion with medium containing neostigmine or hemi-cholinium. This difference in release was almost (85%) accounted for at the end of the experiment by extra radioactive ACh in the ganglia perfused with choline—Krebs. It is concluded that during preganglionic nerve stimulation approximately 50-60% of endogenously produced choline is recaptured for ACh synthesis; thus, during activity preganglionic nerve terminals appear selectively to accumulate choline.4. However, chronically decentralized ganglia accumulated as much choline as did acutely decentralized ganglia, and this was interpreted as indicating that at rest preganglionic nerve terminals do not selectively accumulate choline.5. Increased exogenous choline concentration increased the amount of radioactivity collected during nerve stimulation in the absence, but not the presence, of an anticholinesterase agent. The spontaneous efflux of radioactivity was little affected by changes in external choline levels. It is concluded that exogenous choline and choline made available from released transmitter compete for uptake into nerve terminals.

A method has been developed for localizing sites of cholinesterase activity in rat cardiac muscle by electron microscopy. The method utilizes thiocholine esters as substrates, and is believed to be dependent on the reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide by thiocholine released by enzymatic activity. The ferrocyanide thus formed is captured by copper to form fine, electron-opaque deposits of copper ferrocyanide, which sharply delineate sites of enzymatic activity at the ultrastructural level. Cholinesterase activity in formalin-fixed heart muscle was localized: (a) in longitudinal elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not in the T, or transverse, elements; and (b) in the A band, with virtually no activity noted in the M band, or in the H zone. The I band was also negative. No activity was detected in the sarcolemma, or in invaginations of the sarcolemma at the level of the Z band. The perinuclear element of the sarcoplasmic (endoplasmic) reticulum was frequently strongly positive. Activity at all sites was completely abolished by omitting the substrates, or by inhibition with eserine 10-4 M and diisopropylfluorophosphate 10-5 M. Eserine 10-5 M completely inhibited reaction in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and virtually abolished that in the A band. These observations, together with the use of the relatively specific substrates and suitable controls to eliminate non-enzymatic staining, indicate that cholinesterase activity was being demonstrated. The activity in rat heart against different substrates was that of non-specific cholinesterases, in accordance with biochemical data. The activity in the A band was considered to be probably due to myosincholinesterase. It is proposed that the localization of cholinesterases in myocardium at the ultrastructural level should be taken into account in considering the possible functions of these myocardial enzymes, and it is hoped that knowledge of their localization will open up new avenues of approach in considering their physiological role in myocardium, which at present is not definitely known.

Subcellular fractionation of rat spinal cord on continuous sucrose density gradients provides evidence for the existence of a specific synaptosomal fraction (enriched in pinched-off nerve endings) that accumulates glycine selectively by way of a high-affinity transport system. The particles in this fraction sediment to a less-dense portion of sucrose gradients than do particles that accumulate neutral, basic, aromatic, and acidic amino acids. Particles accumulating γ-aminobutyric acid are even less-dense than those storing exogenous glycine. The glycine-specific synaptosomal fraction also exists in the brain stem but not in the cerebral cortex. These findings provide neurochemical support for the suggestion that glycine has a specialized synaptic function, perhaps as neurotransmitter, in mammalian spinal cord.

Electrophysiological evidence for the existence of dendritic spikes in the Purkinje cells of pigeon cerebellar cortex is presented. Intradendritic records indicate that the electroresponsive properties of the dendrites linger after voltage-dependent sodium and potassium conductances are reduced by superfusion of the cortex with Ringer's solution containing 20 mug/ml tetrodotoxin and 5 mM 3-aminopyridine. Dendritic spikes could be evoked, in the complete absence of activity from all cerebellar afferents and from the soma and axon of the Purkinje cells, by direct electrical activation of the surface of the cerebellar cortex or by intracellular injection of current via the recording electrode. The denritic electroresponsiveness was blocked by superfusion with 20 mM Mn2+ or Co2+. It is thus concluded that dendrites of Purkinje cells in birds are capable of generating calcium-dependent spikes. The possible role of such a calcium current in neuronal function is discussed.

1. Labelled precursors of choline, namely ethanolamine, dimethylaminoethanol and methionine and also labelled choline itself were injected intraperitoneally into the adult female rat and the incorporation into lipids and water-soluble fractions was traced in liver, blood and brain. 2. No significant free choline was detected and no labelling of the phosphorylcholine of blood. There was, however, considerable labelling of the phosphorylcholine of brain and liver. 3. After intracerebral injection, [1,2-14C]dimethylaminoethanol was rapidly phosphorylated and converted into phosphatidyldimethylaminoethanol, presumably by the cytidine pathway. 4. In view of the pattern of labelling and the amount of phosphatidylcholine in the tissues examined, it seems highly likely that choline is transported to the brain by the blood in a lipid-bound form.

The localization and chemical determination of acetylcholin esterase in the frog sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia were studied by a combination of the methods of electron microscopy, histochemistry, and microgasometric analysis with the magnetic diver. The Koelle-Friedenwald copper thiocholine histochemical method was modified by eliminating the sulfide conversion and by treatment of the tissue with potassium permanganate. In fixed tissue, enzymatic activity was demonstrated on the inner surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, subsurface cisternae, and agranular reticulum of the perikaryon and axon. In briefly fixed tissue, end product appeared also at the axon-sheath and the sheath-sheath interface. Activity at the synaptic junction was most readily obtained in unfixed tissue. Isolated neurons recovered from the diver following chemical analysis were studied with the electron microscope. Cells having a high enzyme activity showed a badly ruptured or absent neural plasmalemma and sheath. In this case the measured activity was apparently due to the enzyme present in the endoplasmic reticulum. Neurons having low activity exhibited an intact plasmalemma and sheath. This may reflect the effectiveness of the neural plasmalemma and sheath as a penetration barrier. The effects of fixation on enzyme activity are discussed. Electron microscopic examination of cells following microgasometric analysis is shown to be essential for the interpretation of the biochemical data.

1. The subcellular distributions of glutamate decarboxylase and aspartate transaminase were studied in rat and guinea-pig brain. 2. Glutamate decarboxylase is localized in the synaptosome fraction. The mean density of the particles containing the enzyme is slightly greater than those derived from cholinergic neurones, though overlap is substantial. 3. The enzyme is readily released from synaptosomes by hypo-osmotic treatment, but in the presence of Ca2+, Na+ and K+ it sediments with particulate material. 4. The release and binding of the enzyme to membrane fractions by Ca2+ were investigated. 5. Aspartate transaminase is present in brain as two isoenzymes with different kinetic properties. One isoenzyme is associated with the cytoplasm and the other with mitochondria.ImagesFig. 2.

"The epithelia of a number of glands and cavitary organs of the rat and guinea pig have been surveyed, and in all cases investigated, a characteristic tripartite junctional complex has been found between adjacent cells. Although the complex differs in precise arrangement from one organ to another, it has been regularly encountered in the mucosal epithelia of the stomach, intestine, gall bladder, uterus, and oviduct; in the glandular epithelia of the liver, pancreas, parotid, stomach, and thyroid; in the epithelia of pancreatic, hepatic, and salivary ducts; and finally, between the epithelial cells of the nephron (proximal and distal convolution, collecting ducts). The elements of the complex, identified as zonula occludens (tight junction), zonula adhaerens (intermediary junction), and macula adhaerens (desmosome), occupy a juxtaluminal position and succeed each other in the order given in an apical-basal direction. The zonula occludens (tight junction) is characterized by fusion of the adjacent cell membranes resulting in obliteration of the intercellular space over variable distances. Within the obliterated zone, the dense outer leaflets of the adjoining cell membranes converge to form a single intermediate line. A diffuse band of dense cytoplasmic material is often associated with this junction, but its development varies from one epithelium to another. The zonula adhaerens (intermediate junction) is characterized by the presence of an intercellular space (∼200 A) occupied by homogeneous, apparently amorphous material of low density; by strict parallelism of the adjoining cell membranes over distances of 0.2 to 0.5 µ; and by conspicuous bands of dense material located in the subjacent cytoplasmic matrix. The desmosome or macula adhaerens is also characterized by the presence of an intercellular space (∼240 A) which, in this case, contains a central disc of dense material; by discrete cytoplasmic plaques disposed parallel to the inner leaflet of each cell membrane; and by the presence of bundles of cytoplasmic fibrils converging on the plaques. The zonula occludens appears to form a continuous belt-like attachment, whereas the desmosome is a discontinuous, button-like structure. The zomula adhaerens is continuous in most epithelia but discontinuous in some. Observations made during experimental hemoglobinuria in rats showed that the hemoglobin, which undergoes enough concentration in the nephron lumina to act as an electron-opaque mass tracer, does not penetrate the intercellular spaces beyond the zonula occludens. Similar observations were made in pancreatic acini and ducts where discharged zymogen served as a mass tracer. Hence the tight junction is impervious to concentrated protein solutions and appears to function as a diffusion barrier or ""seal."" The desmosome and probably also the zonula adhaerens may represent intercellular attachment devices."	JUNCTIONAL COMPLEXES IN VARIOUS EPITHELIA	Marilyn G. Farquhar, George E. Palade	13944428	1963-05-01	10	
"Cell junctions have been investigated in the amphibian epidermis, a stratified squamous epithelium, and compared to those described previously in simple columnar epithelia of mammalian cavitary organs. In adult frogs and toads, and in larvae approaching metamorphosis, belts of membrane fusion or zonulae occludentes of considerable depth are regularly found between adjoining cells of the outermost layer of the stratum corneum, binding the cells together into a continuous, uninterrupted sheet. Another set of occluding zonules appears in the second cornified layer (when such a layer is present), and a third set usually occurs in the outermost layer of the stratum granulosum. Specialized elements described as ""modified"" and ""composite"" desmosomes are encountered along the lateral and basal aspects, respectively, of the cornified cells; ordinary desmosomes and maculae occludentes (i.e., spots of membrane fusion) are found in all other strata. The usual 200 A intercellular gap is generally maintained between the cells of the stratum germinativum at the basal ends of the intercellular spaces. Hence, the intercellular spaces of the epidermis form a largely continuous network, closed to the external medium and open to the dermal interstitia. The situation is comparable to that found in columnar epithelia, except that the intercellular spaces are much more extensive, and an extracellular subcompartment (or two) apparently exists in the stratum corneum and between the latter and the stratum granulosum. The last subcompartment is usually filled with a dense substance, probably derived from discharged secretory granules. The tripartite junctional complex characteristic of lumen-lining epithelia (i.e., a zonula occludens followed by a zonula adhaerens, and desmosome) is seen only in early larvae; in adults and in larvae approaching metamorphosis, the occluding zonule is followed directly by a series of modified desmosomes. Interpreted in the light of current physiological data, these findings suggest that the diffusion of water, ions, and small, water-soluble molecules is impeded along the intercellular spaces of the epidermis by zonulae occludentes while it is facilitated from cell to cell within the epidermis by zonulae and maculae occludentes."

"Somatic muscle cells of Ascaris lumbricoides consist of three differently specialized components referred to as the fiber, which contains the contractile apparatus (described previously), the belly, and the arm. The belly is shown to be a sac of glycogen, which is depleted during starvation of the animal. The arm extends to a nerve cord where it establishes a myoneural junction characterized by giant mitochondria and clusters of vesicles in the nerve fibers and by a 500 A neuromuscular gap. The arms, which have been shown to be ""electrically interconnected"" in the vicinity of the nerve cord, form ""tight junctions"" with one another in just this region. At high magnification, these junctions can be resolved into several types. In some there is fusion of the outer leaflets of the membranes with formation of an intermediate line. Others resemble septate desmosomes in that a residual extracellular space ∼20 A in width remains between the membranes, but the outer leaflets are interconnected across the gap. It is suggested that the term ""tight junction"" encompasses a variety of structures distinguishable only at high magnification and that the different variations are not necessarily equivalent functionally."

"The interconnections and the surfaces of the striated muscle cells which occur in thoracic and in lung veins of the mouse were studied with the electron microscope. The osmium-fixed tissues were embedded in methacrylate or in araldite and sectioned with a Porter-Blum microtome. Many preparations were stained before embedding with phosphotungstic acid or after sectioning with uranyl acetate. Typical intercalated discs are observed in this muscle. They are similar to the discs found in heart muscle. These intercalated discs represent boundaries between separate muscle cells. Along the discs, cells are joined in planes normal to their myofilaments. The same cells are also joined in planes parallel to the myofilaments by means of lateral interconnections. These lateral cell boundaries are in continuity with the intercalated discs. Three morphologically distinct parts occur within the lateral cell interconnections: One is characterized by small vesicles along the plasma membrane, the second part has the structure of desmosomes, and a third part represents an external compound membrane (formed by the two plasma membranes of the adjoining cells) and is termed ""quintuple-layered cell interconnection."" Small vesicles and plasma membrane enfoldings along the free surface of muscle cells are interpreted as products of a pinocytosis (phagocytosis) process. Some of them are seen to contain small membrane-bounded bodies or granules. The free cell surface shows a characteristic outer dense layer (""basement membrane"") which accompanies the plasma membrane. The topographic relation of this dense layer with the plasma membrane seems to vary in different preparations. The significance of this variation is not well understood. On two occasions a typical arrangement o vesicles and tubules was observed at Z band levels, just beneath the plasma membrane. These structures are believed to represent endoplasmic reticulum. Their possible significance for the conduction of excitation is discussed."	THE STRIATED MUSCULATURE OF BLOOD VESSELS II. Cell Interconnections and Cell Surface	H. E. Karrer	13751592	1960-09-01	10	
Observations additional to those previously reported (34) on boutons terminaux and club endings on Mauthner cell lateral dendrites, primarily as seen in sections of permanganate-fixed material, are described. Certain new findings on OSO4-fixed endings are also included. The boutons terminaux are closely packed in the synaptic bed with ∼ 100 to 150 A gaps between their contiguous unit membranes and a few interspersed glial extensions. Their synaptic membrane complexes (SMC) appear as pairs of unit membranes separated by ∼ 100 to 150A clefts. They contain many vesicles and unoriented mitochondria, but no neurofilaments. The club endings after KMnO4 fixation are, as after OSO4 fixation (34), again seen surrounded by a layer of extracellular matrix material. These endings contain relatively few synaptic vesicles, a few unit membrane limited tubules ∼ 300 A in diameter, and mitochondria oriented perpendicular to the SMC. Neurotubules and neurofilaments are not clearly seen. These components are also virtually absent in the Mauthner cytoplasm. No ribosomes are seen in the KMnO4-fixed material. The unit membranes of the SMC of club endings show up clearly in essentially the same junctional relations described after formalin-OSO4 fixation (34). In addition, the synaptic discs in transverse section show a central beading repeating at a period of ∼ A associated with scalloping of the cytoplasmic surfaces. In oblique views, dense lines are seen repeating at a period of ∼ 90 A. In frontal views a hexagonal array of close-packed polygonal facets is seen. These repeat at a period of ∼ 95 A. Each has a central dense spot <25 A in diameter. Similar subunits are seen in the unit membranes of synaptic vesicles.

1. Glomerular permeability was studied by ultrastructural cytochemistry, using as protein tracers two intravenously injected peroxidases of differing molecular weight. 2. Horseradish peroxidase (molecular weight 40,000) passed rapidly through the endothelial fenestrae, across the basement membrane, and through the epithelial slits into the urinary space. Human myeloperoxidase (molecular weight 160,000 to 180,000) also passed rapidly through the endothelial fenestrae and across the basement membrane, but was impeded at the level of the epithelial slits. Both proteins were taken up in large amounts by the mesangial cells. 3. The present findings indicate that the epithelial slits are the primary filtration barrier responsible for the differential permeability to proteins of varying molecular size. 4. The observations also support the concept that an important function of the mesangial cells is the incorporation and disposal of glomerular filtration residues.

"Horseradish peroxidase was administered to mice by intravenous injection, and its distribution in cerebral cortex studied with a recently available technique for localizing peroxidase with the electron microscope. Brains were fixed by either immersion or vascular perfusion 10–60 min after administration of various doses of peroxidase. Exogenous peroxidase was localized in the lumina of blood vessels and in some micropinocytotic vesicles within endothelial cells; none was found beyond the vascular endothelium. Micropinocytotic vesicles were few in number and did not appear to transport peroxidase while tight junctions between endothelial cells were probably responsible for preventing its intercellular passage. Our findings therefore localize, at a fine structural level, a ""barrier"" to the passage of peroxidase at the endothelium of vessels in the cerebral cortex. The significance of these findings is discussed, particularly with reference to a recent study in which similar techniques were applied to capillaries in heart and skeletal muscle."

An electron microscope study of goldfish Mauthner cells is reported.1 The cell is covered by a synaptic bed ∼ 5 µ thick containing unusual amounts of extracellular matrix material in which synapses and clear glia processes are implanted. The preterminal synaptic neurites are closely invested by an interwoven layer of filament-containing satellite cell processes. The axoplasm of the club endings contains oriented mitochondria, neurofilaments, neurotubules, and relatively few synaptic vesicles. That of the boutons terminaux contains many unoriented mitochondria and is packed with synaptic vesicles and some glycogen but no neurofilaments or neurotubules. The bare axons of club endings are surrounded by a moderately abundant layer of matrix material. The synaptic membrane complex (SMC) in cross-section shows segments of closure of the synaptic cleft ∼ 0.2 to 0.5 µ long. These alternate with desmosome-like regions of about the same length in which the gap widens to ∼ 150 A and contains a condensed central stratum of dense material. Here, there are also accumulations of dense material in pre- and postsynaptic neuroplasm. The boutons show no such differentiation and the extracellular matrix is largely excluded around them. The axon cap is a dense neuropil of interwoven neural and glial elements free of myelin. It is covered by a closely packed layer of glia cells. The findings are interpreted as suggestive of electrical transmission in the club endings.	THE ULTRASTRUCTURE OF MAUTHNER CELL SYNAPSES AND NODES IN GOLDFISH BRAINS	J. David Robertson, Thomas S.

The wall of the blood capillaries of skeletal muscles (diaphragm, tongue, hind legs) and myocardium of the rat, guinea pig, and hamster consists of three consecutive layers or tunics: the endothelium (inner layer), the basement membrane with its associated pericytes (middle layer), and the adventitia (outer layer). The flattened cells of the endothelium have a characteristic, large population of cytoplasmic vesicles which, within the attenuated periphery of the cells, may attain a maximum frequency of 120/µ2 of cell front and occupy ∼18% of the cytoplasmic volume; these values decrease as the cells thicken toward the perikaryon. The vesicles are 650–750 A in over-all diameter and are bounded by typical unit membranes. They occur as single units or are fused to form short chains of two to three vesicles. Each configuration may lie entirely within the cytoplasm or open onto the cell surface. In the latter case, the unit membrane of the vesicle is continuous, layer by layer, with the plasmalemma. Chains of vesicles opening simultaneously on both the blood and tissue fronts of the endothelial tunic have not been observed either in sections or in a tridimensional reconstruction of a sector of endothelial cell cytoplasm. Adjacent endothelial cells are closely apposed to one another and appear to be joined over a large part of their margins, possibly over their entire perimeter, by narrow belts of membrane fusion (zonulae occludentes). Except for tongue capillaries, patent intercellular gaps are rare or absent. The middle layer is formed by a continuous basement membrane (∼500 A thick) and by pericytes which lie in between leaflets of this membrane. The tips of the pericyte pseudopodia penetrate through the inner leaflet of the basement membrane and join the endothelium in maculae occludentes. The adventitia is a discontinuous layer comprising cellular (macrophages, fibroblasts, mast cells) and extracellular (fibrils, amorphous matrix) elements. The same general type of construction appears to be used along the entire length of the capillary.	STUDIES ON BLOOD CAPILLARIES I. General Organization of Blood Capillaries in Muscle	Romaine R.

Previous work has shown that endogenous chemical mediators, of which histamine is the prototype, increase the permeability of blood vessels by causing gaps to appear between endothelial cells. In the present paper, morphologic and statistical evidence is presented, to suggest that endothelial cells contract under the influence of mediators, and that this contraction causes the formation of intercellular gaps. Histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin were injected subcutaneously into the scrotum of the rat, and the vessels of the underlying cremaster muscle were examined by electron microscopy. To eliminate the vascular collapse induced by routine fixation, in one series of animals (including controls) the root of the cremaster was constricted for 2–4 min prior to sacrifice, and the tissues were fixed under conditions of mild venous congestion. Electron micrographs were taken of 599 nuclei from the endothelium of small blood vessels representing the various experimental situations. Nuclear deformations were classified into four types of increasing tightness (notches, foldsl closing folds, and pinches. In the latter the apposed surfaces of the nuclear membrane are in contact). It was found that: (1) venous congestion tends to straighten the nuclei in al groups; (2) mediators cause a highly significant increase in the number of pinches (P < 0.001), also if the vessels are distended by venous congestion; (3) fixation without venous congestion causes vascular collapse. The degree of endothelial recoil, as measured by nuclear pinches, is very different from that caused by mediators (P < 0.001). (4) Pinched nuclei are more frequent in leaking vessels, and in cells adjacent to gaps (P < 0.001); (5) mediators also induce, in the endothelium, cytoplasmic changes suggestive of contraction, and similar to those of contracted smooth muscle; (6) there is no evidence of pericyte contraction under the conditions tested. Occasional pericytes appeared to receive fine nerve endings. Various hypotheses to explain nuclear pinching are discussed; the only satisfactory explanation is that which requires endothelial contraction.

Antisera to human uterine actomyosin were prepared in rabbits and conjugated with fluorescein (F-AUAM). When F-AUAM was applied to frozen sections of normal human kidney which were then examined by ultraviolet light microscopy, it was observed that vascular smooth muscle, endothelium of arteries, veins, and peritubular capillaries and glomerular mesangial cells were immunofluorescent. Neither glomerular endothelium nor epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule or renal tubules were stained by F-AUAM. The specificity of antisera for actomyosin was confirmed by absorption and blocking studies, examination of a wide variety of tissues and immunodiffusion in agarose gel. It may be inferred from these data that mesangial cells are contractile. Contraction of the mesangium may play a significant role in regulating glomerular blood flow and in the reaction of the glomerulus to injury.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 7Fig 8Fig 9Fig 10Fig 11	Demonstration of Actomyosin in Mesangial Cells of the Renal Glomerulus	Carl G.

In experiments described herein it was observed, by direct and indirect immunofluorescence technics, that rabbit antisera to human platelet actomyosin (thrombosthenin) stained mature megakaryocytes, blood platelets, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of arteries and veins, endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and certain capillaries, uterine smooth muscle cells, myoepithelial cells, perineurial cells of peripheral nerves and “fibroblastic” cells of granulation tissue. The specificity of immunohistologic staining was confirmed by appropriate absorption and blocking studies and immunodiffusional analysis in agarose gel. It was also observed by immunodiffusional analysis in agarose gel, electrophoresis of actomyosin fragments in polyacrylamide gels, immune inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity and immune aggregation of platelets that uterine and platelet actomyosin are partially, but not completely, identical.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 7Fig 8Fig 9Fig 10Fig 11	Contractile Proteins of Endothelial Cells, Platelets and Smooth Muscle	Carl G.

The in vitro interaction of soluble horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with homogeneous mono layers of mouse macrophages has been studied using sensitive biochemical and cytochemical techniques. The compartmentalization of HRP in extracellular and intracellular sites has been quantitatively evaluated. A significant fraction is bound to a serum-derived layer, which coats the surface of culture vessels and may be removed by appropriate washes. Macrophages interiorize HRP as a solute in pinocytic vesicles without appreciable binding of the glycoprotein to the plasma membrane. Uptake is directly proportional to the concentration of HRP in the culture medium. 1 x 106 cells ingest 0.0025% of the administered load per hr over a wide range of concentrations. Cytochemically, all demonstrable HRP is sequestered within the endocytic vesicles and secondary lysosomes of the vacuolar apparatus. After uptake, the enzymatic activity of HRP is inactivated exponentially with a half-life of 7–9 hr, until enzyme is no longer detectable. When macrophages have pinocytosed trace-labeled HRP-125I, cell-associated isotope disappears with a t ½ of 20–30 hr and they release monoiodotyrosine-125I into the culture medium. We were unable to obtain evidence that significant amounts of HRP (>2%) can be exocytosed after uptake, can exist intact on the cell surface, or can be digested extracellularly. It is difficult to reconcile these observations with several of the postulated mechanisms whereby macrophages are thought to play a prominent role in the induction of an immune response.

Concanavalin A (Con A) binds to saccharide residues on the mouse peritoneal macrophage plasma membrane and stimulates extensive pinocytic interiorization of the membrane. The overall pinocytic rate is increased 3.5–4.5 times by the addition of Con A, and the surface marker enzyme adenosine triphosphatase can be identified histochemically in association with the cytoplasmic vesicles generated after exposure of the cells to Con A. Once formed, these pinocytic vesicles may persist for several days and fail to show morphologic evidence of fusion with primary or preformed secondary lysosomes. There is no apparent effect on the capacity of the macrophage to ingest either latex particles or IgG-coated SRBC administered either simultaneously with or subsequent to the Con A.

"The musculature of small lung veins, of the thoracic portion of the inferior vena cava, and of other thoracic veins of the mouse have been studied in the electron microscope. Tissues were fixed in 1 per cent osmium tetroxide buffered with veronal, to which either sodium chloride or sucrose had been added. Methacrylate or araldite served as embedding matrices. Phosphotungstic acid or uranyl acetate was used to stain some of the preparations. Thin sections were examined in a Siemens and Halske Elmiskop Ib electron microscope. The entire musculature of the veins examined was of the striated type. It represents a variety of cardiac muscle, characterized by centrally located nuclei, typical mitochondria, and narrow I bands. Many I bands cannot be recognized at all. H and M bands are likewise indistinct. There is a double array of primary and secondary myofilaments. Mitochondria are large and numerous and contain many cristae. The endoplasmic reticulum consists of longitudinal tubules which run through the whole sarcomeres and bypass Z bands, and of transverse tubules which accompany Z bands. Some ""triads,"" located at Z levels, consist of flattened vacuoles flanked by such transverse tubules. Small vesicles located at Z bands, close to the nucleus, and beneath the plasma membrane may represent still other portions of the reticulum."	The Striated Musculature of Blood Vessels I.

Pulmonary endothelial cells are capable of metabolizing a variety of circulating hormonal substances. Indirect evidence indicates that some of the relevant enzymes are located on the plasma membrane. The associated caveolae are of special interest as globular subunits, possibly enzyme clusters, are evident in their membranes. In the present study, freeze-etch techniques were used to improve understanding of the fine structure of endothelial cells and to extend our investigations of possible sites of enzymes capable of metabolizing circulating vasoactive agents. As in other cells studied by freeze-etching, intramembranous particles are found on both inner aspects of the plasma membrane. In undifferentiated areas of plasma membrane, the particles appear to have a random distribution. These areas fracture such that approximately equal proportions of the particles adhere to the cytoplasmic aspect of the outer leaflet and the extracellular aspect of the inner leaflet. However, the particles organize into rosettes and plaques at the base of caveolae, and, after fracture, the rosettes and plaques adhere predominantly to the cytoplasmic aspect of the outer leaflet. The peculiar organization of particles in association with caveolae supports the concept that caveolae have a stomal skeletal structure and raises the possibility that the organization may be in some way related to pinocytosis.

The rates of uptake of 125I-labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone), [14C]sucrose and colloidal [198Au]gold by 17.5-day rat yolk sac cultured in vitro were studied. Over a 6.5h period each substrate was accumulated at a constant and reproducible rate of approx. 2microliter/h per mg of protein. After accumulation in vitro, the three substances were released from the tissue into substrate-free medium at low rates. Sucrose present in the medium at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml was without effect on the accumulation of either [14C]sucrose or 125I-labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone), but at higher concentrations inhibited the uptake of both substrates. Some batches of colloidal [198Au]gold had a significantly higher Endocytic Index (up to 5 microliter/h per mg of protein). The Endocytic Index of such a batch decreased with increasing substrate concentration, but colloidal gold did not decrease the Endocytic Index of 125I-labelled poly(vinylpyrrolidone). It is concluded that the three substrates enter the yolk sac by pinocytosis in the liquid phase. Those batches of colloidal [198Au]gold with higher Endocytic Indices are considered to enter also by adsorption on membrane binding-sites.

Pinocytic uptake of 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin by 17.5-day rat visceral yolk sac cultured in vitro has been examined. Uptake was followed by intracellular digestion and, after an initial period, the content of radioactivity in the tissue itself remained constant during the incubation. Radiolabel was returned to the culture medium predominantly as (125I)iodotyrosine; exocytosis of undigested protein did not occur. The rate of uptake of labeled protein, which was constant within an experiment and reproducible between experiments, was much higher than that of a nondigestible macromolecule, 125I-labeled polyvinylpyrrolidone. The higher rate of uptake was a consequence of the protein entering the cells chiefly by adsorption to the plasma membrane being internalized; 125I-labeled albumin did not stimualte, nor did 125I-labeled polyvinylpyrrolidone inhibit pinocytosis. Different preparations of 125I-labeled albumin had characteristically different rates of uptake, probably reflecting differences in affinity for plasma membrane receptors. The physiological significance of the findings is discussed.	Quantitative studies of pinocytosis. II. Kinetics of protein uptake and digestion by rat yolk sac cultured in vitro		233974	1975-01-01	10	
A method is described for the in vitro culture of 17.5-day rat visceral yolk sac. Tissue survival was good as judged by light and electron microscopy. The rate of pinocytic uptake of 125I-labeled polyvinylpyrrolidone by the tissue was constant both within and between experiments. Within the concentration range 0.15-24 mug/ml, the 125I- labeled polyvinylpyrrolidone neither stimulated nor inhibited pinocytosis. The system offers many advantages in the quantitative study of the physical basis of pinocytosis.	Quantitative studies of pinocytosis. I.

The highly pinocytic epithelial cells of the visceral yolk sac from 17.5-day rat conceptuses were used as a model in which to induce engorgement of the vacuolar system by direct accumulation of substances that are not hydrolysed by lysosomal enzymes. The ultra-structural appearances of these cells in pregnant animals that 24-48h before had received intraperitoneal injections of Triton WR-1339, polyvinylpyrrolidone, dextran or sucrose revealed gross abnormalities that were confined to the vacuolar system; in comparison with normal tissue the number, and in some cases the size, of vacuoles was increased, leading to close packing within the apical cytoplasm and distortion of the normal rounded shape. By culturing yolk sacs in vitro, rates of ingestion of 125I-labelled polyvinylpyrrolidone and of 125I-labelled bovine serum albumin were determined, together with the rate of digestion of the labelled protein. The rates of exocytosis of 125I-labelled polyvinylpyrrolidone and of lysosomal enzymes were also determined. No significant differences between normal and highly vacuolated tissues were found. Apparently marked vacuolation of these cells by these agents is without significant effect on pinocytosis, exocytosis or intralysosomal proteolysis.ImagesPLATE 1	A quantitative study of pinocytosis and lysosome function in experimentally induced lysosomal storage.

Rabbit blood monocytes, which contain no cytochemically demonstrable peroxidase, develop peroxidatic activity in the RER and perinuclear cisternae within 2 h after adherence to serum- or fibrin-coated surfaces. A similar reactivity appears in surface-adherent human and rat blood monocytes. In both localization and characteristics, this enzyme reactivity in monocytes resembles that normally seen in the resident peritoneal macrophages of the rabbit, as well as in several types of tissue macrophages in other species. Thus this observation supports the concept, presently based on the kinetic data of other investigators, that blood monocytes are the precursors of such cells. Moreover, the appearance of new enzyme activity after adherence may reflect alterations in cellular metabolism resulting from plasma membrane:surface interactions.

Mouse resident peritoneal macrophages display sufficient 5'- nucleotidase activity to hydrolyze 58 nm AMP/min per cell protein. This activity increases approximately 163 nm AMP/min per mg after 72 h in culture. The enzyme is renewed in unstimulated cells with a half-time of 13.9 h. The activity is not reduced by treatment of intact cells with a variety of proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin, pronase, urokinase, and plasmin. Cells obtained from an inflammatory exudate have diminished or absent levels of enzyme activity. Endotoxin-elicited cells display enzyme activitiy of 20.9 nm AMP/min per mg, while thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages have no detectable activity. The reduced level of activity in endotoxin-stimulated cells is due to their elevated rate of enzyme degradation, with a half-time of 6.9 h. Their rate of enzyme synthesis is essentially normal. No evidence for latent enzyme activity could be obtained in thioglycollate-stimulated cells, nor do these cells produce any inhibition of normal cell enzyme activity. Serum deprivation reduces the enzyme activity of resident cells to about 45% of control activity. These conditions do not significantly affect the rate of enzyme synthesis, but again are explainable by an increase in the rate of enzyme degradation. Pinocytic rate is elevated in endotoxin-stimulated cells which show a more rapid rate of enzyme degradation than unstimulated cells do. However, in serum-free conditions, the rate of enzyme degradation is doubled with no change in the pinocytic rate of the cells.	5'-Nucleotidase activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages. I.

The diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid (DASA) can inactivate about 80% of the total 5'-nucleotidase of viable macrophages. The remaining 20% can be inactivated if the cells are first lysed in detergent, and presumably represents an intracellular pool of 5'-nucleotidase. The bulk of this pool may represent cytoplasmic vesicles derived from plasma membrane by endocytosis. This internal compartment is expanded up to threefold immediately after the cells have ingested a large latex load. This is consistent with previous observations on the internalization of 5'-nucleotidase in latex phagosomes. In latex-filled cells this intracellular pool of enzyme is inactivated over a few hours, and the cells then slowly increase their enzyme activity to nearly normal levels. However, 24 h after latex ingestion the metabolism of 5'-nucleotidase in these recovered cells is abnormal, as the rate of enzyme degradation is about twice the normal rate, and the DASA-insensitive enzyme pool in these cells is strikingly diminished. This may reflect effects of the accumulated indigestible particles on the fate of incoming pinocytic vesicles or on newly synthesized plasma membrane precursor. Another endocytic stimulus, concanavalin A, also reduces the total cell 5'-nucleotidase activity. This effect, which is time and temperature dependent, can be prevented by the competitive sugar alpha-methyl mannose. The concanavalin A inhibition can be reversed in the absence of new protein synthesis or in cells cultivated in serum-free conditions. It is not known whether the effect of concanavalin A on 5'-nucleotidase depends upon the interiorizaiton of plasma membrane or is strictly associated with events at the cell surface.	5'-Nucleotidase activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages.

The cholesterol metabolism of homogeneous populations of mouse peritoneal macrophages was evaluated under in vitro conditions. Macrophages are rich in free cholesterol and maintain a constant cholesterol to protein ratio (12 µg cholesterol/mg protein). No detectable cholesterol ester was present within the cell. More than 95% of total cholesterol was membrane associated and the majority was present in subcellular fractions containing lysosomes and plasma membrane. Less than 0.1% of cell cholesterol was synthesized from acetate-1-14C. During in vitro cultivation, macrophages rapidly exchanged their membrane cholesterol with that of lipoproteins of calf serum. About 30% of the cell cholesterol was exchanged per hour in 20% serum medium, and exchange was nearly complete by 5 hr. Exchange proceeded in a rapid exponential phase followed by a slower phase. Calculations based on a two compartment model indicated that the rapidly exchanging cholesterol compartment represented 60–70% of the total cell cholesterol, and the slowly exchanging compartment accounted for 30–40%. The relationship between serum lipoprotein concentration and exchange rate exhibited first-order kinetics. The rate was determined by thermal energy, in keeping with a Q10 of 2, and an activation energy of 12 kcal/mole. Exchange was independent of bulk transport of lipoproteins by pinocytosis and phagocytosis, and was not linked to energy metabolism. The α-lipoproteins were the major class of proteins of calf serum participating in exchange.	CHOLESTEROL METABOLISM IN THE MACROPHAGE I. THE REGULATION OF CHOLESTEROL EXCHANGE	Zena Werb, Zanvil A. Cohn	5126640	1971-11-30	10	
Macrophage membrane cholesterol is present in two subcellular cholesterol pools, a rapidly exchanging compartment comprising about two-thirds of the total cholesterol, and a slowly exchanging compartment comprising one-third of the total. The morphological identification of the kinetically distinguishable pools proceeded by alteration of each compartment. Trypsin treatment markedly decreased the rate of cholesterol exchange without removing cholesterol from the membrane. Recovery of normal exchange rates took more than 7 hr and required protein synthesis. This suggested that a plasma membrane receptor is involved in positioning of lipoproteins for exchange, and is consistent with the plasma membrane localization of the rapidly exchanging compartment. Extensive pinocytosis by nondegradable dextran, dextran sulfate, or sucrose resulted in the accumulation of many secondary lysosomes, thus increasing the relative proportion of intracellular membranes. The measurable granule membrane area, cholesterol content, phospholipid content, and the relative size of the slowly exchanging cholesterol compartment all increased. The amount of intracellular membrane altered by extensive phagocytosis of latex particles also increased the size of the slowly exchanging cholesterol compartment. This suggested that the slowly exchanging pool of cholesterol represented the intracellular membranes primarily of lysosomal origin. Rabbit alveolar macrophages and thioglycollate-stimulated peritoneal macrophages contain many secondary lysosomes as a result of multiple bouts of in vivo phagocytosis and pinocytosis. In both of these cells the fast and slow pools are equal in size. The increased cholesterol content was attributable to the increase in the relative size of the slowly exchanging compartment. L-cells and melanoma cells also exchange their cholesterol with that of serum lipoproteins. Both cells contain few cholesterol-rich intracellular membranes, and had lower cellular cholesterol contents. In these cells the slowly exchanging pool was a minor contribution to cell cholesterol. Studies with these cells provided further evidence for the lysosomal membrane and plasma membrane localization of the slowly and rapidly exchanging cholesterol compartments.

Actin purified from mouse fibroblasts by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis was used as antigen to obtain an antibody in rabbits. The elicited antibody was shown to be specific for actin as judged by immunodiffusion and complement fixation against partially purified mouse fibroblast actin and highly purified chicken muscle actin. The antibody was used in indirect immunofluorescence to demonstrate by fluorescence light microscopy the distribution and pattern of actin-containing filaments in a variety of cell types. Actin filaments were shown to span the cell length or to concentrate in “focal points” in patterns characteristic for each individual cell.Images	Actin Antibody: The Specific Visualization of Actin Filaments in Non-Muscle Cells	Elias Lazarides, Klaus Weber	4210210	1974-06-01	10	
Intermediate filaments-cytoplasmic filaments with a diameter of 8-9 nm-have been described in a large variety of cell types. In this study, the subunit protein of the neurofilament and the presumptive subunit of the astroglial filament are compared by immunological and biochemical methods and are found to be very similar. Strong crossreactions are also found between these proteins in a variety of mammalian species. These results suggest that the intermediate filaments may, like microtubules and microfilaments, represent a highly conserved  and widely distributed fibrous protein system.Images	Biochemistry of the filaments of brain.

"Cytochalasin B (CB) induces a biphasic retraction is some cell types. The rapid response that peaks in 30 min leads to the ""dendritic"" condition. Replicating myogenic and fibrogenic cells, as well as postmitotic myoblasts and myotubes, participate in this reaction. This is followed by a slower phase that requires 40 h for stabilization and leads to the fully ""absorized"" state. Only replicating myogenic and fibrogenic cells participate in this reaction. Postmitotic myoblasts and myotubes do not arborize but round up and float off into the medium. Pretreatment with Colcemid does not block the rapid response to CB, but does block arborization. CB-arborized cells exposed to Colcemid while in the presence of CB develop sufficient tension to pull themselves apart. If CB depolymerizes actin-like filaments, and if such filaments constitute the only contractile system in the cell, then it is difficult to visualize how cells in CB develop such tension. Colcemid induces twisting, birefringent bands in interphase- and metaphase-arrested myogenic and fibrogenic cells, and in postmitotic myotubes. Such bands are more evident when CB-arborized cells are removed from CB and allowed to relax in Colcemid. These birefringent bands assemble in the prescence of cycloheximide, and may constitute 20% of the volume of the cell."	Response of myogenic and fibrogenic cells to cytochalasin B and to colcemid. I.

"Vascular endothelial cells cultured from guinea pig aorta or portal vein contain naturally occurring bundles of 100 A (diameter) filaments that completely encircle the nucleus. These rings are phase lucent and birefringent when examined with the light microscope. Perinuclear bundles of 100 A filaments were also seen in endothelial cells in vivo, indicating that they are a normal cytoplasmic component. These filaments did not decorate with S-1, and were not disrupted by glyceination. With these cells, experiments were designed to answer the following questions: (a) does Colcemid have an effect on these naturally occuring bundles? And (b) do these filaments remain during cell division? Endothelial cells grown in the presence of Colcemid were followed over 24 h. The perinuclear ring coiled into a juxtanuclear cap that consisted of disorganized arrays of 100 A filaments. This ""coiling"" effect was not blocked by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. In another experiment, dividing cells were examined. During division the bundle of filaments is passively pulled in half into the daughter cells. These bundles did not disappear during the mitosis when mitotic spindle microtubules assemble. These studies suggest that Colcemid may exert a direct effect on 100 A filaments, independent of microtubules. Since these filaments do not disappear during mitosis, it is possible that in these cells the 100 A filaments and tubulin do not share a common pool of precursor proteins."

Heavy meromyosin (HMM) forms characteristic arrowhead complexes with actin filaments in situ. These complexes are readily visualized in sectioned muscle. Following HMM treatment similar complexes appear in sectioned fibroblasts, chondrogenic cells, nerve cells, and several types of epithelial cells. Thin filaments freshly isolated from chondrogenic cells also bind HMM and form arrowhead structures in negatively stained preparations. HMM-filament complexes are prominent in the cortex of a variety of normal metaphase and Colcemid-arrested metaphase cells. There is no detectable binding of HMM with other cellular components such as microtubules, 100-A filaments, tonofilaments, membranes, nuclei, or collagen fibrils. The significance of HMM-filament binding is discussed in view of the finding that arrowhead complexes form in types of cells not usually thought to contain actin filaments.

A cell line from the intima of the rabbit aorta has been established. This cell line exhibits strict contact inhibition, and morphologically resembles intimal endothelial cells. B-type blood group antigens and the presence of fibrinolytic activity also distinguish these cells from smooth muscle cells and from fibroblasts of the aortic wall. Endothelial cells were assayed for changes in levels of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) in response to a series of vasoactive drugs. Control levels for cAMP and cGMP are 7.01 +/- 0.82 and 1.50 +/- 0.06, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Norepinephrine, acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and phenylephrine increased the levels of both nucleotides significantly. Propranolol (10-5 M) and phentolamine (10-5M) inhibited, respectively, the cAMP and cGMP response to norepinephrine. Angiotensin II and histamine significantly increased cGMP levels but not cAMP levels of the endothelial cells. The cGMP increases with acetylcholine were inhibited by atropine. These results indicate that the established cell line is endothelial in nature and contains cellular receptors to a variety of vasoactive agents.Images	Hormone and neurotransmitter receptors in an established vascular endothelial cell line.

Neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN) and their precursors from normal human marrow and blood were examined by histochemical staining and by electron microscopy and cytochemistry in order to determine the origin and nature of their cytoplasmic granules. Human neutrophils contain two basic types of granules, azurophils and specifics, which differ in morphology, contents, and time of origin. Azurophils are large and may be spherical or ellipsoid, the latter with a crystalline inclusion. They are produced in the first secretory stage (promyelocyte), contain peroxidase and various lysosomal enzymes, and thus correspond to modified primary lysosomes. Specifics are smaller, may be spherical or elongated, and are formed during a later secretory stage (myelocyte). They lack lysosomal enzymes and contain alkaline phosphatase and basic protein; their contents remain largely undetermined. Specifics outnumber azurophils in the mature PMN because of reduction in numbers of azurophils per cell by cell division in the myelocyte stage. The findings indicate that the situation is basically the same as described previously in the rabbit, insofar as the origin, enzymic activity, and persistence in the mature cell of the two types (azurophil and specific) of granules are concerned. The main difference between PMN of the two species is in the morphology (size, shape, and density) of the granules, especially the azurophils.

Extensive cell contacts which resemble septate junctions occur between cells in the three major zones of the rat adrenal cortex. Characteristically, they extend between small intercellular canaliculi and the periendothelial space, frequently interrupted by gap junctions and rarely by desmosomes. Zonulae occludentes have not been identified in the adrenal cortex. Along this distinctive cell contact, the cell membranes of apposing cells are separated by 210–300 a bisected by irregularly spaced 100–150-A extracellular particles which are often circular in profile. In lanthanum preparations, these particles appear to form a continuous chain throughout the intercellular space and are visualized as an alveolate structure in sections parallel to the plane of the cell membrane. The cell membrane in the area of septate-like contact does not differ from nonjunctional areas of the cell membrane in freeze-fracture replicas. The cell contact retains its integrity after cell dispersion and after the separation of cell membranes from disrupted cells. The intercellular particles also persist after brief extraction in lipid solvents. Besides adherence, possible functions of this adrenal contact include maintenance of the width of the extracellular space, the provision of channels between intercellular canaliculi and the bloodstream, and utilization as cation depots. Similar structures are also present between adrenal cortical cells of several other species and between interstitial cells of the testis. This type of cell contact may, in fact, be a typical feature of steroid-hormone-secreting tissues in vertebrates.	A DISTINCTIVE CELL CONTACT IN THE RAT ADRENAL CORTEX	Daniel S. Friend, Norton B.

Studies were undertaken to investigate further the basis of intimal proliferation and the identity of the surface lining cell in rabbit aortas subjected to extensive deendothelialization. Endothelial cells were selectively removed by passage of an inflated balloon catheter through the arterial lumen. The healing response was evaluated at intervals up to 36 weeks by several techniques: 1) permeability to Evans blue, 2) reappearance of endothelial cells as indicated by the specific marker, adsorbed goat anti-rabbit tissue factor-horseradish peroxidase, 3) planimetric measurements of intimal thickness, and 4) electron microscopy. The results indicate that endothelial cell recovery progressed slowly and that it extended only from areas spared denudation. The regions not covered by endothelial cells were lined by cells of smooth muscle cell origin. Such areas were permeable to Evans blue-protein complex, and their luminal smooth muscle cells were associated with connective tissue-like material at their luminal surface; this material apparently acted as a base for platelet accumulation. The present findings indicate that the lumen of the extensively denuded vessel is lined by either endothelial or smooth muscle cells and that intimal healing is related to restoration of endothelial cell cover. In addition, intimal thickening reached a maximum well before reendothelialization was complete.ImagesFigure 5Figure 6Figure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4	Intimal healing.

The fine structure of the intima of the pig aortic arch is described for areas of spontaneously differing in vivo endothelial permeability, as demarcated by uptake of the protein-binding azo dye Evans blue. Areas of enhanced permeability (blue areas) consistently show a variety of features not observed in areas devoid of dye accumulation (white areas). The subendothelial space of blue areas is markedly thickened and edematous, containing collagen, elastic tissue elements, and undifferentiated cells dispersed in an amorphous floccular matrix of low electron density. Endothelial cells in blue areas are generally cuboidal, with relatively short, frequently vacuolated junctions. In contrast, endothelial cells from white areas are flat and elongate, with long intercellular junctions exhibiting many interdigitations. Cytoplasmic differences include a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and more frequent lysosomal bodies in blue areas and a prominent Golgi apparatus in the endothelium of white areas. Additionally, endothelial cell injury or death with and without denudation occurs with a significantly greater frequency in blue relative to white areas. An endothelial glycocalyx is some threefold thicker over the surface of white relative to blue areas. It is concluded that neither endothelial structure nor function are homogeneous within the aortic arch of the young pig and that areas of spontaneously differing permeability to proteins are associated with a spectrum of alterations in endothelial and intimal morphology.ImagesFigure 14Figure 15Figure 16Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5Figure 17Figure 18Figure 6Figure 7Figure 8Figure 9Figure 10Figure 11Figure 12Figure 1Figure 2Figure 13	Endothelial Cell Morphology in Areas of In Vivo Evans Blue Uptake in the Aorta of Young PigsII.

Cytochemical and ultrastructural examination of the developing atherosclerotic lesion in hypercholesterolemic rhesus monkeys reveals that lipid is sequestered within lysosomes of aortic smooth muscle cells. A common pathway in the development of sclerotic arterial disease appears to be overloading of vascular smooth muscle cell lysosomes with a variety of metabolites. This may occur as a consequence of an excess of substrate or because of a congenital deficiency of a lysosomal hydrolase.ImagesFig 1Fig 2	Lipid accumulation in smooth muscle cell lysosomes im primate atherosclerosis.

Endothelial cells in tissue culture degrade bradykinin and convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II. These are both functions of a single dipeptidyl hydrolase, angiotensin converting enzyme. Monolayer cultures were prepared from human, rabbit, pig, and calf vessels. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was assessed by adding either bradykinin or angiotensin I to the cells in culture flasks, and measuring residual peptide over time by radioimmunoassay. Peptide degradation was inhibited by the specific converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881. The flasks were equilibrated with varying hypoxic gas mixtures: hypoxia rapidly (less than 2 min) decreased enzyme activity and room air restored it as rapidly. The extent to which activity was reduced was a direct function of PO2 (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001), and there was no enzyme activity below a PO2 of 30 mm Hg. Four preparations were studied with respect to decrease in enzyme activity by hypoxia: (a) intact cells in monolayer, (b) sonicated cells, (c) sonicated cells from which converting enzyme was partially dissolved by a detergent, and (d) purified converting enzyme. Hypoxia had progressively less of an inhibiting effect on the enzyme activity of the preparations as the degree of cell integrity decreased. Hypoxia inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme activity in cultured endothelial cells, but the effect of hypoxia is not on the enzyme per se, but appears to be a unique characteristic of the endothelial cell.Images	Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity in cultured endothelial cells by hypoxia.

Vascular endothelial cells derived from rabbit vena cava and maintained in continuous culture exhibited properties characteristic of the intact endothelium. These cells were used as a model for characterizing the fibrinolytic components specified by the endothelium. Endothelial cells in culture digested radiolabeled fibrinogen. Digestion resulted from the synthesis and secretion of a plasminogen activator. Fibrinolysis was not detected when cells were grown in medium lacking plasminogen, indicating the absence of plasminogen-independent fibrinolytic enzymes. Phorbol-myristate-acetate increased extracellular plasminogen activator activity dramatically. This increase was prevented when actinomycin D or cycloheximide was included in the growth medium, indicating that new gene expression was required for it. Intracellular plasminogen activator could not be detected unless the cell extracts were exposed briefly to mildly acidic conditions. Mixing experiments between acid-treated and untreated extracts suggested that the cells contained a potent, acid-labile inhibitor of fibrinolysis. As little as 10 μg of protein from whole cell extracts inhibited both cell and urokinase-mediated fibrinolysis by more than 70%. Cell fractionation studies localized the inhibitor to the cytosol whereas plasminogen activator activity was restricted to the membrane-rich fraction. This membrane fraction did not require acidification for activity, suggesting that the inhibitor had been removed and that acidification did not activate a plasminogen proactivator. These observations demonstrate that regulation of endothelial fibrinolytic activity is far more complex than had been anticipated and raise several uncertainties in regard to detecting the presence of plasminogen activators in cells and tissues.Images	Synthesis of fibrinolytic activator and inhibitor by endothelial cells*	David J.

Aortic endothelial cells from normal pigs and pigs with von Willebrand disease have been established in long-term cultures. Both cultures appeared similar in terms of general growth characteristics, morphologic features and ultrastructure. Immunofluorescent staining of these cultures with chicken (or rabbit) antiporcine ristocetin-Willebrand factor sera (or IgG) resulted in extensive perinuclear staining of the cells in both cultures. Additionally, staining of semiconfluent cultures of normal cells for ristocetin-Willebrand factor revealed an extensive meshwork of distinct, immunologically identifiable ristocetin-Willebrand factor-containing filaments between cells. Immunoreactive material was considerably decreased and more diffuse between cells in semiconfluent cultures from affected pigs. Through immunocytochemical staining with peroxidase-coupled antiserum, the filaments (of indeterminate length) were found to have a diameter of approximately 300 A. Finally, washed porcine platelets interacted extensively with scrape-damaged cultures of affected endothelial cells. This interaction of platelets with damaged normal cultures was abolished by pretreatment of the cultures with rabbit antiporcine ristocetin-Willebrand factor IgG.Images	Cultured aortic endothelial cells from pigs with von Willebrand disease: in vitro model for studying the molecular defect(s) of the disease.

The contents of adenine nucleotides as well as steady-state concentrations of a number of glycolytic, pentose phosphate-pathway and tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates were measured in extracts of livers from normal and phenobarbital-treated rats that were perfused with p-nitroanisole. Metabolites were measured in livers that were freeze-clamped during periods of maximal rates of drug metabolism. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital increased rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation approx. fivefold. The concentrations of lactate, xylulose 5-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate were increased by phenobarbital treatment, whereas that of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate declined. Perfusion of livers with p-nitroanisole produced significant increases in 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose 5-phosphate in livers from phenobarbital-treated rats, but not in livers from control rats. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital caused [NADP+]/[NADPH] to change in the direction of more oxidation, as calculated from measured concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose 5-phosphate; however, the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from `malic' enzyme was not changed. Additions of p-nitroanisole produced a reduction of NADP+ as calculated from 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity, but did not alter the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from substrates assumed to be in equilibrium with `malic' enzyme. Activities of both glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and `malic' enzyme were increased by phenobarbital treatment. NAD+ became more reduced as a result of phenobarbital treatment; however, perfusion of livers with p-nitroanisole did not cause a change in the oxidation–reduction state of this nucleotide. Concentrations of adenine nucleotides in livers were not altered significantly by treatment of rats with phenobarbital; however, a significant decline in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio occurred during mixed-function oxidation of p-nitroanisole in livers from phenobarbital-treated rats, but not in livers from normal rats. Perfusion of livers with two other substrates for mixed-function oxidation, hexobarbital and aminopyrine, produced an increase in the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from `malic' enzyme. In contrast with livers perfused with p-nitroanisole, there was no significant change in adenine nucleotides in livers exposed to hexobarbital or aminopyrine. Addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (25μm) to the perfusate containing aminopyrine decreased the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and tended to prevent the oxidation of NADPH observed with aminopyrine alone. Thus in the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, NADPH generation may exceed its utilization via mixed-function oxidation.

1. Chronic ethanol administration to rats for 21–27 days increases the rate of O2 consumption as measured in liver slices. The extra respiration can be abolished by inhibition of the active transport of Na+ and K+. Dinitrophenol activates the respiratory rate in the liver of the treated animals only in the presence of ouabain. 2. Active (ouabain-sensitive) transport of 86Rb and (Na++K+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activity were increased in the livers of the ethanol-treated animals. 3. Chronic ethanol administration also led to a decrease in the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) in the liver cell owing to a decrease in [ATP] and an increase in [Pi]. 4. It is suggested that an increased sodium pump activity is responsible for the increased oxidative capacity and for the insensitivity to dinitrophenol observed in the livers of ethanol-treated animals.

"Salt-extracted microsomal membranes (K-RM) contain an activity that is capable of releasing the signal recognition particle (SRP)-mediated elongation arrest of the synthesis of secretory polypeptides (Walter, P., and G. Blobel, 1981, J. Cell Biol., 91:557-561). This arrest- releasing activity was shown to be a function of an integral microsomal membrane protein, termed the SRP receptor (Gilmore, R., P. Walter, and G. Blobel, 1982, J. Cell Biol., 95:470-477). We attempted to solubilize the arrest-releasing activity of the SRP receptor by mild protease digestion of K-RM using either trypsin or elastase. We found, however, that neither a trypsin, nor an elastase ""solubilized"" supernatant fraction exhibited the arrest-releasing activity. Only when either the trypsin- or elastase-derived supernatant fraction was combined with the trypsinized membrane fraction, which by itself was also inactive, was the arrest-releasing activity restored. Release of the elongation arrest was followed by the translocation of the secretory protein across the microsomal membrane and the removal of the signal peptide. Thus, although we have been unable to proteolytically sever the arrest- releasing activity from K-RM and thereby to uncouple the release of the elongation arrest from the process of chain translocation, we have been able to proteolytically dissect and reconstitute the arrest-releasing activity. Furthermore, we found that the arrest-releasing activity of the SRP receptor can be inactivated by alkylation of K-RM with N- ethylmaleimide."	Protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum.

"The signal recognition particle (SRP)-mediated elongation arrest of the synthesis of nascent secretory proteins can be released by salt- extracted rough microsomal membranes (Walter, P., and G. Blobel, 1981, J. Cell Biol, 91:557-561). Both the arrest-releasing activity and the signal peptidase activity were solubilized from rough microsomal membranes using the nonionic detergent Nikkol in conjunction with 250 mM KOAc. Chromatography of this extract on SRP-Sepharose separated the arrest-releasing activity from the signal peptidase activity. Further purification of the arrest-releasing activity using sucrose gradient centrifugation allowed the identification of a 72,000-dalton polypeptide as the protein responsible for the activity. Based upon its affinity for SRP, we refer to the 72,000-dalton protein as the SRP receptor. A 60,000-dalton protein fragment (Meyer, D. I., and B. Dobberstein, 1980, J. Cell Biol., 87:503-508) that had been shown previously to reconstitute the translocation activity of protease- digested membranes, was shown here by peptide mapping and immunological criteria to be derived from the SRP receptor. Findings that are in part similar, and in part different from these reported here and in our preceding paper were made independently (Meyer, D. I., E. Krause, and B. Dobberstein, 1982, Nature (Lond.). 297:647-650) and the term ""docking protein"" was proposed for the SRP receptor. A lower membrane content of both SRP and the SRP receptor than that of membrane bound ribosomes suggests that the SRP-SRP receptor interaction may exist transiently during the formation of a ribosome-membrane junction and during translocation."

Human cultured lymphocytes (IM-9) were used to demonstrate that insulin can enter the intact cell and bind to the nucleus. When these lymphocytes were incubated with 125I-labeled insulin, specific cellular uptake reached a maximum within 2 min and remained at a plateau for 90 min or longer. Partially purified nuclei from such cells contained approximately 15-20% of the total cellular radioactivity. Nuclei freed of all other cellular fractions (by washing the partially purified nucleic with Triton X-100) bound approximately 7% of the total cellular radioactivity. In contrast to the rapid uptake of labeled insulin into the intact cell, specific binding to the nucleus was half-maximal after 5 min of incubation and maximal after 90 min. Both the cellular uptake and subsequent nuclear binding of labeled insulin were progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of unlabeled hormone. Independent evidence for the nuclear binding of insulin was obtained by preparing autoradiographs of lymphocytes incubated for various times with labeled insulin. Such preparations strongly suggest that insulin binds to the plasma membrane, enters the cytosol, and then binds to the nucleus.Images	Cellular uptake and nuclear binding of insulin in human cultured lymphocytes: evidence for potential intracellular sites of insulin action.

Incubation of physiological concentrations of 125I-labeled insulin with liver membranes in the presence of anti-insulin IgG results in a 7- to 15-fold increase in the specific binding of the hormone. The low-affinity/high-capacity binding sites are replaced by an apparently homogeneous class of high-affinity sites, and the nonlinear Scatchard plots are converted to linear plots without a change in the maximum number of binding sites. Similarly, the binding of insulin to receptors in 3T3 fibroblasts is increased substantially in the presence of anti-insulin antibody, and the biological activity of subactive concentrations of insulin is enhanced by antibody in these cells. However, the affinity of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factors (EGF) in fibroblasts is not affected by anti-EGF IgG. In adipocytes anti-insulin IgG in the same concentration range only inhibits the binding of insulin and suppresses insulin-mediated glucose oxidation. Monovalent Fab' fragments from anti-insulin IgG inhibit the binding of the hormone, indicating that the enhancement of binding in liver membranes and fibroblasts requires the bivalency of the antibody.

1. Intradendritic recordings from Purkinje cells in vitro indicate that white matter stimulation produces large synaptic responses by the activation of the climbing fibre afferent, but antidromic potentials do not actively invade the dendritic tree. 2. Climbing fibre responses may be reversed in a manner similar to that observed at the somatic level. However, the reversal does not show the biphasicity often seen at somatic level. 3. Input resistance of these dendrites was found to range from 15 to 30 M omega. The non-linear properties seen at the somatic level for depolarizing currents are also encountered here. However, there seems to be less anomalous rectification. 4. Detailed analysis of repetitive firing of Purkinje cells elicited by outward DC current shows that, as in the case of the antidromic invasion, the fast somatic potentials (s.s.) do not invade the dendrite actively. However, the dendritic spike bursts (d.s.b.s) interposed between the s.s. potentials are most prominent at dendritic level. 5. Two types of voltage-dependent Ca responses were observed. At low stimulus level a plateau-like depolarization is accompanied by a prominent conductance change; further depolarization produces large dendritic action potentials. These two classes of response are TTX-resistant but are blocked by Cd, Co, Mn or D600, or by the removal of extracellular Ca. 6. Following blockage of the Ca conductance, plateau potentials produced by a non-inactivating Na conductance are observed mainly near the soma indicating that this voltage-dependent conductance is probably associated with the somatic membrane. 7. Spontaneous firing in Purkinje cell dendrites is very similar to that observed at the soma. However, the amplitude of these bursts is larger at dendritic level. It is further concluded that these TTX-insensitive spikes are generated at multiple sites along the dendritic tree. 8. Six ionic conductances seem to be involved in Purkinje cell electroresponsiveness: (a) an inactivating and (b) a non-inactivating Na conductance at or near the soma, (c) a spike- and (d) a plateau-generating Ca conductance, and (e) voltage-dependent and (f) Ca-dependent K currents. 9. The possible role of these conductances in Purkinje cell integration is discussed.	Electrophysiological properties of in vitro Purkinje cell dendrites in mammalian cerebellar slices.

We have previously described the use of Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic-interaction chromatography to isolate the Ca2+ + phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) and a novel heat-stable 21 000-Mr Ca2+-binding protein from bovine brain [Walsh, Valentine, Ngai, Carruthers & Hollenberg (1984) Biochem. J. 224, 117-127]. The procedure described for purification of the 21 000-Mr calciprotein to electrophoretic homogeneity has been modified to permit the large-scale isolation of this Ca2+-binding protein, enabling further structural and functional characterization. The 21 000-Mr calciprotein was shown by equilibrium dialysis to bind approx. 1 mol of Ca2+/mol, with apparent Kd approx. 1 microM. The modified large-scale purification procedure revealed three additional, previously unidentified, Ca2+-binding proteins of Mr 17 000, 18 400 and 26 000. The 17 000-Mr and 18 400-Mr Ca2+-binding proteins are heat-stable, whereas the 26 000-Mr Ca2+-binding protein is heat-labile. Use of the transblot/45CaCl2 overlay technique [Maruyama, Mikawa & Ebashi (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 95, 511-519] suggests that the 18 400-Mr and 21 000-Mr Ca2+-binding proteins are high-affinity Ca2+-binding proteins, whereas the 17 000-Mr Ca2+-binding protein has a relatively low affinity for Ca2+. Consistent with this observation, the 18 400-Mr and 21 000-Mr Ca2+-binding proteins exhibit a Ca2+-dependent mobility shift on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, whereas the 17 000-Mr Ca2+-binding protein does not. The amino acid compositions of the 17 000-Mr, 18 400-Mr and 21 000-Mr Ca2+-binding proteins show some similarities to each other and to calmodulin and other members of the calmodulin superfamily; however, they are clearly distinct and novel calciproteins. In functional terms, none of the 17 000-Mr, 18 400-Mr or 21 000-Mr Ca2+-binding proteins activates either cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase or myosin light-chain kinase, both calmodulin-activated enzymes. However, the 17 000-Mr Ca2+-binding protein is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C. It may therefore serve to regulate the activity of this important enzyme at elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations.ImagesFig. 1.

Swiss-mouse 3T3 cells permeabilized with saponin were used to study the specificity of the inositol trisphosphate-induced release of 45Ca2+ from their intracellular stores. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was the most potent compound studied (dose giving half-maximal effect 0.3 microM). 45Ca2+ was also released by inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate, glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, with doses giving half-maximal effect of respectively 1.6 microM, 1.6 microM and 20 microM, but not by inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (50 microM). These data suggest that the trans-vicinal phosphates on the 4- and 5-positions are essential for the Ca2+-mobilizing effect of inositol trisphosphate, and that in addition there is a requirement for a phosphate group on the opposite side of the molecule, with a preference for the 1-position.

Aggregation of the receptor for IgE on mast cells, basophils, and a tumor analog, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, induces a calcium-dependent degranulation of the cells. We have measured the membrane potential (delta psi) of RBL cells during this reaction by using the tetraphenylphosphonium ion (Ph4P+) equilibration technique. We observed a 20-45% reduction in ionophore-sensitive Ph4P+ accumulation. The phenomenon persisted under conditions expected to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential, consistent with the effect being due to a change in delta psi of the plasma membrane. We estimated that the change reflects a depolarization of 20 mV (from -90 to -70 mV, interior negative). Whereas degranulation fails to occur in the absence of external Ca2+, this was not true of the depolarization, indicating that the latter was not a consequence of secretion. When aggregation of the receptor is induced by reaction of the cell-bound IgE with a multivalent antigen, the secretory reaction can be halted by adding a univalent hapten. In this case, complete repolarization occurs. Equivalent depolarization was observed in the absence of Na+ but was diminished when both Ca2+ and Na+ were absent. Together, the data suggest that aggregation of the receptor opens ion channels and that the latter disappear promptly when the receptors are disaggregated. It is plausible that formation of these channels leads to the entry of Ca2+ and is an early and critical consequence of the aggregation of the receptors, thereby leading to degranulation.

Micro-injection of submicromolar concentrations of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate caused a raising of the fertilization envelope in eggs of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. This effect was dependent both on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and on co-injection with a Ca2+-mobilizing compound, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was the most potent compound tested in this assay; removal of the 3- or 5-phosphates or randomization of the phosphates in the inositol ring decreased its potency. These results show that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is an intracellular second messenger, and suggest that its function is to control cellular Ca2+ homoeostasis at the plasma membrane.

Carbachol stimulation of muscarinic receptors in rat cortical slices prelabelled with myo-[2-3H]inositol caused the rapid formation of a novel inositol polyphosphate. Evidence derived from its chromatographic behaviour, and from the structure of the products formed in partial dephosphorylation experiments, suggests that it is probably D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. An enzyme in human red cell membranes specifically removes the 5-phosphate from it to form inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. It is suggested that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is likely to be a second messenger, and that it is the precursor of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate and possibly of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

When [3H]inositol-prelabelled rat parotid-gland slices were stimulated with carbachol, noradrenaline or Substance P, the major inositol trisphosphate produced with prolonged exposure to agonists was, in each case, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Much lower amounts of radioactivity were present in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate fraction separated by anion-exchange h.p.l.c. Analysis of the inositol trisphosphate head group of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in [32P]Pi-labelled parotid glands showed the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but no detectable phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. Carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol-labelled parotid glands contained an inositol polyphosphate with the chromatographic properties and electrophoretic mobility of an inositol tetrakisphosphate, the probable structure of which was determined to be inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. Since an enzyme in erythrocyte membranes is capable of degrading this tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, it is suggested to be the precursor of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in parotid glands.	Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and not phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate is the probable precursor of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in agonist-stimulated parotid gland.

Addition of 1 mM-carbachol to [3H]inositol-labelled rat parotid slices stimulated rapid formation of [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, the accumulation of which reached a peak 20 s after stimulation, and then declined rapidly towards a new steady state. The initial rate of formation of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was slower than that for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The radioactivity in [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate fell quickly in carbachol-stimulated and then atropine-blocked parotid slices, suggesting that it is rapidly metabolized during stimulation. Parotid homogenates rapidly dephosphorylated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and, less rapidly, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was specifically hydrolysed to a compound with the chromatographic properties of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. The only 3H-labelled phospholipids that we could detect in parotid slices labelled with [3H]inositol for 90 min were phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Parotid homogenates synthesized inositol tetrakisphosphate from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This activity was dependent on the presence of ATP. We suggest that, during carbachol stimulation of parotid slices, the key event in inositol lipid metabolism is the activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate thus liberated is metabolized in two distinct ways; by direct hydrolysis of the 5-phosphate to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and by phosphorylation to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and hence, by hydrolysis of this tetrakisphosphate, to form inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate.	Rapid formation of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in rat parotid glands may both result indirectly from receptor-stimulated release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

Hepatocytes were isolated from rats and then loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin2. Glucagon caused a sustained increase (at least 5 min) in the fluorescence of the quin2-loaded cells; the increase was much greater than that observed with control, non-quin2-loaded, cells. These observations indicate that glucagon caused an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]c). The effects of glucagon were mimicked if forskolin (to activate adenylate cyclase), dibutyryl cyclic AMP or bromo cyclic AMP were added directly to the cells. Thus an increase in cyclic AMP concentration may mediate the effect of glucagon on [Ca2+]c. If 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; an activator of protein kinase C) was added to the cells before glucagon, the magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+]c was greatly diminished. If PMA was added after glucagon it caused a lowering of [Ca2+]c. These effects of PMA on the glucagon-induced increase in [Ca2+]c could not be mimicked if [Ca2+]c was increased by the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin. Thus an event involved in the mechanism by which glucagon increases [Ca2+]c appears to be required for the action of PMA. If [Ca2+]c was increased by forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP or bromo cyclic AMP, the effect of PMA on [Ca2+]c was similar to that observed when glucagon was used to elevate [Ca2+]c. When [Ca2+]c was raised by dibutyryl cyclic AMP the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine did not prevent the subsequent addition of PMA from causing [Ca2+]c to decrease. These observations suggest that PMA can inhibit the cyclic AMP-induced increase in [Ca2+]c independently of any changes in cyclic AMP concentration. Glucagon appears to increase [Ca2+]c by releasing intracellular stores of Ca2+ and stimulating net influx of Ca2+ into the cell; PMA greatly diminishes both of these effects.	4 beta-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate attenuates the glucagon-induced increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration in isolated rat hepatocytes.

We have investigated changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) in activated human platelets, using the fluorescent probe 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Stimulation of platelets by thrombin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate increased pHi by about 0.11 pH unit above the resting value. This increase in pHi depended on the presence of external Na+ and was inhibited by ethylisopropylamiloride. The data suggest that protein kinase C mediates Na+/H+ exchange in human platelets.

1. In fibroblastic L cells, spontaneously repeated hyperpolarizing responses (oscillation of membrane potential) and hyperpolarizing responses evoked by electrical stimuli were suppressed by the external application of a K+ channel blocker, nonyltriethylammonium (C9). This hydrophobic TEA-analogue also inhibited the hyperpolarization induced by intracellular Ca2+ injection.2. Quinine or quinidine, known inhibitors of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel of red cells, instantaneously inhibited these hyperpolarizations. Thus, these hyperpolarizations are likely to be caused by the operation of Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels.3. Azide, which is known to inhibit the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in fibroblasts, and caffeine, dantrolene Na and oxalate, which affect the microsomal Ca2+ transport, did not exert any effects upon the electrical potential profiles.4. On the other hand, Ca2+ channel blockers (nifedipine, D 600 and Co2+) suppressed the hyperpolarizing responses, but not the hyperpolarizations produced by intracellular Ca2+ injection, suggesting that the calcium ions responsible for the hyperpolarizing responses are mainly derived from outside the cell through Ca2+ channels.5. Flavones of plant origin, which are known to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase, prolonged the duration of the hyperpolarizing phase of the oscillation or produced a sustained hyperpolarization.6. It is concluded that the Ca2+ channel and the Ca2+ pump play essential roles in the generation of the hyperpolarizing response and of the membrane potential oscillation in L cells, and that these hyperpolarizations are brought about by a transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ level which, in turn, activates Ca2+-dependent K+ channels.

L cells (a mouse fibroblast cell line) and macrophages have been reported to exhibit slow oscillatory hyperpolarizations and relatively low membrane potentials, when measured with glass micro-electrodes. This paper describes the role of micro-electrode-induced leakage in these oscillations for L cells and a mouse macrophage cell line (P388D1). Both L cells and macrophages showed fast negative-going peak-shaped potential transients upon micro-electrode entry. This shows that the micro-electrode introduces a leakage conductance across the membrane. The peak values of these fast transients were less negative for L cells (-17 mV) than for macrophages (-39 mV), although their sustained resting membrane potentials were about equal (-13 mV). This indicates that the pre-impaled membrane potential of macrophages is more negative than that of L cells. Ionophoretic injection of Ca2+ into the P388D1 macrophages showed the existence of a Ca2+ -dependent hyperpolarizing conductance presumed to be involved in the oscillatory hyperpolarizations of L cells and macrophages. Cells increased in size by X-ray irradiation to reduce membrane input resistances were still found to be susceptible to micro-electrode-induced leakage. Impalement transients upon entry of a second electrode during a hyperpolarization evoked by a first electrode, were often step-shaped instead of peak-shaped due to the high membrane conductance associated with hyperpolarization. Since peak-shaped impalement transients were always seen with the first impalement both in oscillating and non-oscillating cells, oscillatory hyperpolarizations cannot be regarded as spontaneously occurring in the unperturbed cells but are induced by micro-electrode penetration. Since the hyperpolarizing response can be evoked by ionophoretic injection of Ca2+, and oscillatory as well as single hyperpolarizing responses are absent in a Ca2+ -free medium, it is concluded that the Ca2+ needed intracellularly to activate the hyperpolarizing responses enters the cell via the leakage pathway introduced by the measuring electrode.

1. The hormonal control of glycogen breakdown was studied in hepatocytes isolated from livers of fed rats. 2. Glucose release was stimulated by [8-arginine]vasopressin (10pm–10nm), oxytocin (1nm–1μm), and angiotensin II (1nm–0.1μm). These responses are all at least as sensitive to hormone as is glucose output in the perfused rat liver. 3. The effect of these three hormones on glucose release was critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+, unlike that of glucagon. Half-maximal restoration of the vasopressin response occurred if 0.3mm-Ca2+ was added back to the incubation medium. 4. Glycogen breakdown was more than sufficient to account for the glucose released into the medium, in the absence or presence of hormones. Lactate release by hepatocytes was not affected by vasopressin, but was inhibited by glucagon. 5. If Ca2+ was omitted from the extracellular medium, vasopressin stimulated glycogenolysis, but not glucose release. 6. The phosphorylase a content of hepatocytes was increased by vasopressin, oxytocin and angiotensin II; minimum effective concentrations were 0.1pm, 0.1nm and 10pm respectively. This response was also dependent on Ca2+. 7. These results demonstrate that hepatocytes can respond to low concentrations of vasopressin and angiotensin II, i.e. these effects are likely to be relevant in the intact animal. The role of extracellular Ca2+ in the effects of these hormones on hepatic glycogenolysis and glucose release is discussed.

Swiss 3T3 cells incubated for 60 h with [3H]inositol incorporated radioactivity into phosphatidylinositol (PI) and the two polyphosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). On stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) there were significant increases in the levels of inositol 1-phosphate (IP1), inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The effect of PDGF and IP3 on Ca2+ mobilization was studied in both intact cells and in 'leaky' cells that had been permeabilized with saponin. In intact cells, PDGF stimulated the efflux of 45Ca2+, whereas IP3 had no effect. Conversely, IP3 stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux from 'leaky' cells, which were insensitive to PDGF. 'Leaky' cells, which accumulated 45Ca2+ to a steady state within 20 min, were found to release approx. 40% of the label within 1 min after addition of 10 microM-IP3. This stimulation of 45Ca2+ release by IP3 was reversible and was also dose-dependent, with a half-maximal effect at approx. 0.3 microM. It seems likely that an important action of PDGF on Swiss 3T3 cells is to stimulate the hydrolysis of PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol, both of which may function as second messengers. Our results indicate that IP3 mobilizes intracellular Ca2+, and we propose that diacylglycerol may act through C-kinase to activate the Na+/H+ antiport. By generating two second messengers, PDGF can simultaneously elevate the intracellular level of Ca2+ and alkalinize the cytoplasm by lowering the level of H+.

"A possible role in secretory processes is proposed for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), based upon investigations of the Ca2+ steady state maintained by ""leaky', insulin-secreting RINm5F cells. These cells had been treated with digitonin to permeabilize their plasma membranes and thereby ensure that only intracellular Ca2+ buffering mechanisms were active. When placed in a medium with a cation composition resembling that of the cytosol, cells rapidly took up Ca2+ as measured by a Ca2+-specific minielectrode. Two Ca2+ steady states were observed. A lower level of around 120nM required ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and was probably determined by the endoplasmic reticulum. The higher steady state (approx. 800 nM), seen only in the absence of ATP, was shown to be due to mitochondrial activity. IP3 specifically released Ca2+ accumulated in the ATP-dependent pool, but not from mitochondria, since Ca2+ release was demonstrated in the presence of the respiratory poison antimycin. The IP3-induced Ca2+ release was rapid, with 50% of the response being seen within 15s. The apparent Km was 0.5 microM and maximal concentrations of IP3 (2.5 microM) produced a peak Ca2+ release of 10 nmol/mg of cell protein, which was followed by re-uptake. A full Ca2+ response was seen if sequential pulses of 2.5 microM-IP3 were added at 20 min intervals, although there was a slight (less than 20%) attenuation if the intervening period was decreased to 10 min. These observations could be related to the rate of IP3 degradation which, in this system, corresponded to a 25% loss of added 32P label within 2 min, and a 75% loss within 20 min. The results suggest that IP3 might act as a link between metabolic, cationic and secretory events during the stimulation of insulin release."

Evidence has accumulated in support of a role for intracellularly generated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] in raising cytosol [Ca2+] when various hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and other stimulants act on cell surfaces. The increase in [Ca2+] that follows stimulant-receptor interaction is accompanied by rapid hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. One product, Ins(1,4,5)P3, arising from the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was shown to promote the release of Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial stores in a variety of cells. Although platelet intracellular membranes have been implicated in the control of cytosol [Ca2+] and we previously characterized a Ca2+-sequestering mechanism associated with them, we have as yet no knowledge of how this Ca2+ store is mobilized after a stimulus-receptor interaction at the platelet surface. Using free-flow electrophoresis, we isolated and purified human platelet intracellular membranes. They show high enrichment and exclusive localization of the endoplasmic-reticulum marker NADH:cytochrome c reductase, and they sequester Ca2+ by an ATP-dependent process, reaching steady-state values in 10-12 min. Saturation with Ca2+ occurs at around 10-30 microM external Ca2+. When Ins(1,4,5)P3 is added to the 45Ca-loaded vesicles, a rapid release of Ca2+ occurs (approx. 35% in 15-30s). The magnitude of the release depends upon external [Ca2+], being maximum in the range 0.3-0.8 microM and low at external [Ca2+] greater than 1 microM. After release there is a rapid re-uptake of Ca2+, with restoration of the former steady-state values within 1 min. Half-maximal release occurs at approx. 0.25 microM-Ins(1,4,5)P3. This release and re-uptake pattern is not observed with ionophore A23187 or arachidonic acid, both of which liberate Ca2+ irreversibly. Inositol 1,4-bisphosphate was ineffective in releasing Ca2+ from these intracellular membranes. The results support the role of Ins(1,4,5)P3 as a specific intracellular mediator, transducing the action of excitatory agonists acting on the platelet surface into metabolic, mechanochemical and other functional events, known to occur during platelet activation.

GTP, when added to a rat liver microsomal fraction that had previously been allowed to accumulate Ca2+, causes a slow release of Ca2+, which is greatly enhanced by addition of inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The Ca2+ release caused by IP3 under these conditions is very much greater than that observed in the absence of GTP. The effect of GTP is dependent on the presence of polyethylene glycol in the incubation medium and is not due to inhibition of the Ca2+-accumulation system. The response to GTP is time-dependent, particularly at low (4 microM) GTP concentrations, and cannot be mimicked by ATP, ITP, CTP, UTP and GDP. Studies with [gamma-32P]GTP show that, during incubation with microsomal fractions, the terminal phosphate of GTP is transferred to two protein species, of Mr 38 000 and 17 000. These protein phosphorylations are still present when an excess of unlabelled ATP is included in the incubation mixture, but appear to be unaffected by the presence or absence of IP3 and polyethylene glycol. As a working hypothesis, it is suggested that a protein, phosphorylated by GTP, has to bind to the microsomal membranes before IP3 can stimulate Ca2+ release, and that, in vitro, the binding of this protein is favoured by the presence of polyethylene glycol.ImagesFig. 4.Fig. 5.

The Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum exhibits complex kinetics of activation with respect to ATP. ATPase activity is pH-dependent, with similar pH-activity profiles at high and low concentrations of ATP. Low concentrations of Ca2+ in the micromolar range activate the ATPase, whereas activity is inhibited by Ca2+ at millimolar concentrations. The pH-dependence of this Ca2+ inhibition and the effect of the detergent C12E8 (dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether) on Ca2+ inhibition are similar to those observed on activation by low concentrations of Ca2+. On the basis of these and other studies we present a kinetic model for the ATPase. The ATPase is postulated to exist in one of two conformations: a conformation (E1) of high affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP and a conformation (E2) of low affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP. Ca2+ binding to E2 and to the phosphorylated form E2P are equal. Proton binding at the Ca2+-binding sites in the E1 and E2 conformations explains the pH-dependence of Ca2+ effects. Binding of MgATP to the phosphorylated intermediate E1'PCa2 and to E2 modulate the rates of the transport step E1'PCa-E2'PCa2 and the return of the empty Ca2+ sites to the outside surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P. Only a single binding site for MgATP is postulated.	A kinetic model for the Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.

We present a model for Ca2+ efflux from vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It is proposed that efflux is mediated by the Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase that is responsible for Ca2+ uptake in this system. In the normal ATPase cycle of the ATPase, phosphorylation of the ATPase is followed by a conformational change in which the Ca2+-binding sites change from being outward-facing and of high affinity to being inward-facing and of low affinity. To mediate Ca2+ efflux, it is proposed that the ATPase can adopt a conformation in which the Ca2+-binding sites are of low affinity but still outward-facing. It is shown that experimental data on the rates of Ca2+ efflux can be simulated in terms of this model, with Ca2+-binding-site affinities previously proposed to explain ATPase activity [Gould, East, Froud, McWhirter, Stefanova & Lee (1986) Biochem. J. 237, 217-227]. Effects of Mg2+ and adenine nucleotides on efflux rates are explained. It is suggested that Ca2+ efflux from SR mediated by the ATPase could be important in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.

In a previous paper [Gould, East, Froud, McWhirter, Stefanova & Lee (1986) Biochem. J. 237, 217-227] we presented a kinetic model for the activity of the Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here we extend the model to account for the effects on ATPase activity of Mg2+, cations and anions. We find that Mg2+ concentrations in the millimolar range inhibit ATPase activity, which we attribute to competition between Mg2+ and MgATP for binding to the nucleotide-binding site on the E1 and E2 conformations of the ATPase and on the phosphorylated forms of the ATPase. Competition is also suggested between Mg2+ and MgADP for binding to the phosphorylated form of the ATPase. ATPase activity is increased by low concentrations of K+, Na+ and NH4+, but inhibited by higher concentrations. It is proposed that these effects follow from an increase in the rate of dephosphorylation but a decrease in the rate of the conformational transition E1'PCa2-E2'PCa2 with increasing cation concentration. Li+ and choline+ decrease ATPase activity. Anions also decrease ATPase activity, the effects of I- and SCN- being more marked than that of Cl-. These effects are attributed to binding at the nucleotide-binding site, with a decrease in binding affinity and an increase in 'off' rate constant for the nucleotide.

Homogenization of muscle gives a preparation of sealed vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the presence of ATP these vesicles will initially accumulate Ca2+ from the external medium and then spontaneously release this Ca2+ in two phases, an initial slow phase and a faster second phase. By measuring ATP concentrations in parallel with measurements of external Ca2+ concentrations we have shown that the second phase of release occurs when the added ATP has been exhausted, but that the first phase of release occurs in the presence of ATP. A similar pattern of uptake and release has been observed in the presence of acetyl phosphate, showing that ADP generated by ATP hydrolysis is not essential for the release process. The temperature-dependence of both phases of release is similar to the temperature-dependence of ATPase activity. Release is dependent on pH over the same pH range as affects binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase. Therefore we propose that Ca2+ release from vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum actively loaded with Ca2+ is mediated by the same Ca2+ + mg2+-activated ATPase as is responsible for uptake of Ca2+.

We have examined the effect of diet on the phospholipid composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit muscle. Enriching the diet with corn or fish oil results in significant changes in the fatty acyl chain composition of the various phospholipid classes, with relatively little change in the relative contents of the phospholipids. These alterations in composition have no significant effect on the ATPase activity of vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum or on the pattern of Ca2+ uptake and release.

Ca2+ homoeostasis was investigated in pheochromocytoma neurosecretory (PC12) cells both before and after treatment with nerve growth factor, which induces a neuronal-like differentiation accompanied by a large increase in the number of muscarinic receptors. The resting concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, measured by the quin2 technique, was found to be higher and more variable in differentiated cells. Moreover, the [Ca2+]i rises induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and by depolarizing concentrations of KC1 were greater and more transient. Exposure to carbachol induced modest, but long-lasting, [Ca2+]i rises, which were faster and greater in differentiated than in non-differentiated cells. These effects were due to the activation of the muscarinic receptor, because they were unaffected by nicotinic blockers (hexamethonium and D-tubocurarine) and completely eliminated by low concentrations of the muscarinic antagonists atropine and pirenzepine [IC50 (concn. causing 50% inhibition) = 2 and 60 nM respectively]. The muscarinic-receptor-dependent [Ca2+]i rises were the result of two concomitant processes: (1) redistribution of Ca2+ from cytoplasmic stores to the cytosol, possibly mediated by generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a consequence of the muscarinic-receptor-coupled hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, and (2) increased Ca2+ influx through a pathway of the plasmalemma insensitive to verapamil and thus different from the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. The existence of this second process was documented: (a) by the difference of the [Ca2+]i responses brought about by carbachol in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free media; (b) by the occurrence of [Ca2+]i rise and increased 45Ca accumulation in cells exposed to 1 mM-CaCl2 after having been treated for 2 min with carbachol in Ca2+-free medium; (c) by typical differences in the quin2 signal kinetics observed in parallel samples of PC12 cells loaded with different concentrations of the dye.

The dependence of phospholipase C activity on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied in intact liver cells treated with the Ca2+-mobilizing hormone vasopressin, or not so treated. Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was estimated from the formation of [3H]inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and the degradation of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). The [Ca2+]i of the cells was clamped from 29 to 1130 nM by quin2 loading. This wide concentration range was obtained by loading the hepatocytes with a high concentration of the Ca2+ indicator in low-Ca2+ medium or by using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in medium containing Ca2+. In resting cells, in which [Ca2+]i was 193 nM, treatment with 0.1 microM-vasopressin which stimulates liver PLC maximally, tripled InsP3 content and raised [Ca2+]i to 2 microM within 15 s. Lowering [Ca2+]i partially decreased cell InsP3 content as well as the ability of vasopressin to stimulate InsP3 formation maximally. At 29 nM, the lowest Ca2+ concentration obtained in isolated liver cells, basal InsP3 content was 64% of that measured in control cells. Addition of vasopressin no longer affected [Ca2+]i, but significantly increased InsP3 by 200%, although less than in the controls (300%). The maintenance of the greater part of the PLC response at constant [Ca2+]i indicated that, in the liver, InsP3 formation does not result from an increase in [Ca2+]i. The effects of lowering [Ca2+]i were reversible. When low cell [Ca2+]i was restored to a normal value, resting InsP3 content and the ability of vasopressin to stimulate InsP3 formation maximally by 300% were also restored. Raising [Ca2+]i from 193 to 1130 nM had little effect on the InsP3 content or the vasopressin-mediated increase in InsP3. In agreement with the stimulation of PLC activity by vasopressin, cell [3H]PtdInsP2 and total PtdInsP2 were degraded by application of this hormone for 15 s. In contrast, when [Ca2+]i was lowered to 29 nM, basal [3H]PtdInsP2 and total PtdInsP2 were increased by about 30%, [3H]PtdInsP2 was further increased by vasopressin, but total PtdInsP2 was not changed. These results show that, in intact hepatocytes, PLC is little affected by [Ca2+]i concentrations above 193 nM, but is partially dependent on Ca2+ below that value. They suggest that, in addition to activating PLC activity, vasopressin might stimulate PtdInsP2 synthesis, presumably via phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase, and that this pathway might predominate in cells with low [Ca2+]i.

The addition of bradykinin to NG115-401L cells grown on coverslips results in the generation of rapid transient increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and inositol phosphates. Changes in intracellular Ca2+, measured using the fluorescent indicator dye Fura-2, show two components; an initial rapid peak in [Ca2+]i which is essentially independent of extracellular Ca2+, and a sustained plateau dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Analysis of bradykinin stimulated production of [3H]inositol phosphates, by h.p.l.c., shows a rapid biphasic production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol tetrakisphosphate and inositol bisphosphates, followed by a sustained rise in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate production. Quantitative measurements have indicated the presence of other, more polar, [3H]inositol-labelled metabolites which do not show major changes on bradykinin stimulation. The initial phase of inositol phosphate production parallels the rapid transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+], however, the second phase of inositol phosphate production occurs when intracellular [Ca2+] is declining and implies a complex series of regulatory events following receptor stimulation. Similar time courses of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ signals provides supporting evidence that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is the second messenger coupling bradykinin receptor stimulation to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.

The effects of the potent tumour-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) metabolism were investigated in the neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. TPA (100 nM) stimulated by 150-200% the release into the medium of 3H radioactivity from cells that had been pre-labelled with [3H]choline. H.p.l.c. analysis of the medium revealed that TPA stimulated the release of only free [3H]choline (212 +/- 11% of control), without affecting such other labelled metabolites as [3H]phosphocholine and [3H]glycerophosphocholine. This effect was concentration-dependent, with a half-maximal effect obtained at 27.5 +/- 6.8 nM, and was observable as early as 5-10 min after exposure to TPA. The TPA-induced release of [3H]choline into the medium was accompanied by a small and variable decrease in cellular [3H]PtdCho (to 93 +/- 4% of control). However, the radioactivity associated with water-soluble cellular choline metabolites (mainly [3H]phosphocholine and [3H]glycerophosphocholine) remained unchanged. TPA also stimulated the release of [3H]choline derived from [3H]PtdCho that had been produced via the methylation pathway from [3H]methionine. These data suggest that phosphatidylcholine may serve as the source of free choline released from the cells in response to TPA. The possible enzymic mechanisms underlying this response are discussed.

Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinase activities from non-transformed and polyoma-middle-T-transformed murine fibroblasts were examined. Both normal and transformed 3T3 fibroblasts have two PtdIns kinases, which can be separated by anion-exchange chromatography. One of these activities (Type I) has a Km for ATP of 10 microM, is resistant to inhibition by adenosine, AMP or ADP, and is inhibited by non-ionic detergents. The other activity (Type II) has a somewhat higher Km for ATP (35 microM) and is inhibited competitively by ADP, AMP and adenosine at concentrations suggesting regulation of this activity by the energy charge of the cell. The Type II PtdIns kinase is activated by non-ionic detergents. We have previously reported the specific association of a PtdIns kinase activity with polyoma-middle-T immunoprecipitates [Whitman, Kaplan, Schaffhausen, Cantley & Roberts (1985) Nature (London) 315, 239-242; Kaplan, Whitman, Schaffhausen, Raptis, Garcea, Pallas, Roberts & Cantley (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 3624-3628]. Comparison of the immunoprecipitated PtdIns kinase with the activities identified by ion-exchange chromatography indicates that it is the Type I enzyme which specifically associates with the middle-T/pp60c-src complex. This PtdIns kinase activity is separable from both middle T and pp60c-src. Type I PtdIns kinase also associates with pp60v-src immunoprecipitates from Rous-sarcoma-virus-transformed cells. Furthermore, this PtdIns kinase appears to co-precipitate with partially purified platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. The amount of this activity found in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates or in wheat-germ-lectin-agarose precipitates is increased 50-fold by stimulation of quiescent Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts with PDGF. These results suggest that the Type I PtdIns kinase is regulated by agents which affect cell growth and transformation, whereas the Type II PtdIns kinase may be regulated by the local [ATP]/[ADP] ratio.

Hepatic parenchymal cells from adult rats, established in vitro as a monolayer, have been evaluated by electron microscopy. Within 24 h after the initial seeding, the incubated cells were polygonal and in close apposition with three to six neighboring cells. The ultrastructure of the monolayer cells was examined at this time and after 3 and 10 days of incubation. With the exception of a few enlarged mitochondria, organelles in both the 1- and 3-day monolayer cells were indistinguishable quantitatively and morphologically from those found in the intact liver. After 10 days of incubation, however, the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER) had become dilated and vesiculated. In all cells studied, portions of RER were found in a close spatial relationship to mitochondria. From its frequency, this association appeared to be more than fortuitous, and the organelle complex may represent a functional unit necessary for new membrane formation, as suggested previously. The Golgi complexes of 1- and 3-day cells contained very low density lipoprotein-sized particles, which suggests that the monolayer cells synthesize lipoproteins. These electron microscope observations demonstrate that adult hepatic parenchymal cells in monolayer retain for several days the subcellular structural elements characteristic of normally functioning hepatocytes.

An acute intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (0.7 or 2.1g/kg body wt.) causes the reversible, dose-dependent accumulation of hepatic triglyceride in rats. By using a pulse of [14C]palmitate injected into a tail vein, it was found that ethanol (2.1g/kg)had no effect on the flux of unesterified fatty acid of serum (4.3mumol/min per 100g body wt.). However, either dose increased the fraction of the total flux going to liver from 0.16 to0.27 as rapidly as could be measured (30s), and it remained elevated until all ethanol had been cleared from the blood. The fraction of the total radioactivity in lipids of liver that was in triglyceride increased linearly for 1 h from 30 to 50% and there was a simultaneous decrease in phospholipid from 60 to 40%. The rate of synthesis of hepatic triglyceride derived directly from unesterified fatty acid of serum was calculated by using the flux rate of unesterified fatty acid in serum, the fractional hepatic uptake of this flux, and the percentage of liver fatty acid esterified to triglyceride. This contribution is related to the total synthetic rate of hepatic triglyceride (rate of accumulation+rate of release) to determine quantitatively how much of the developing fatty liver is attributable to increased uptake of unesterfied fatty acid of serum. At the higher dose of ethanol, about half of the accumulating triglyceride is derived from this source, whereas with the lower dose of ethanol it can account for all of the build-up.

Studies were made on the mechanism by which livers of ethanol-treated rats take up an increased fraction of the total flux of unesterified fatty acid in serum. It was found that ethanol (0.7g/kg) causes a twofold rise in the serum content of liver, and that this serum is in rapid equilibrium with the general circulation. The fractional hepatic uptake from serum of group of compounds with varying uptake mechanisms and metabolic fates was studied in control and ethanol-treated animals. All the compounds tested, including unesterified fatty acid, showed an enhanced uptake when ethanol was given. For one of the compounds, carbon tetrachloride, a dose/response relationship was established between the amount administered, the amount taken up by liver, and the amount metabolized. These findings were interpreted to mean that this dose of ethanol causes the liver to receive an increased flow of blood, and as a result all compounds present and capable of being taken by liver are taken up at an increased rate. Hepatic blood flow was measured by a technique that monitors the rate of clearance of a colloidal lipid emulsion. It was found that ethanol increased hepatic blood flow by about 60%. This effect of ethanol on hepatic blood flow provides an explanation for the fatty liver and the synergistic effect between an acute dose of ethanol and carbon tetrachloride. A hypothesis to explain why a moderate dose of ethanol causes triglyceride to accumulate in liver is presented.

Hepatocytes isolated from livers of fasted rats form little glycogen from glucose or lactate at concentrations below 20 mM. Glycogen is formed in substantial quantities at a glucose concentration of 60 mM. In the presence of 10 mM glucose, 20-30% as much glycogen as glucose is formed from fructose, sorbitol, or dihydroxyacetone. The addition of either glutamine, alanine, or asparagine stimulates the formation of glycogen from lactate 10- to 40-fold. The formation of glucose and glycogen is then about equal, and glycogen deposition in hepatocytes is similar to rates attained in vivo after fasted rats are refed. The amino acids stimulate 1.5- to 2-fold glycogen synthesis from fructose, and 2- to 4-fold synthesis from dihyDROXYACETONE. Ammonium chloride is about one-half as effective as amino acids in stimulating glycogen synthesis when glucose with lactate are substrates. It increased glycogen synthesis 25-50% from fructose but inhibited synthesis from dihydroxyacetone plus glucose.	Stimulation of hepatic glycogen synthesis by amino acids.

Primary monolayer cultures were obtained in 60-mm petri dishes by incubating 3 X 10(6) isolated hepatocytes at 37 degrees C in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 17% fetal calf serum. The ultrastructure of monolayer cells was examined after various incubation periods. Within 4 h of plating, the isolated spherical cells adhere to the plastic surface, establish their first contacts by numerous intertwined microvilli, and form new hemidesmosomes. After 12 h of culture, wide branched trabeculae of flattened polyhedral cells extend in all directions. Finally, after 24 h of culture, bile canaliculi are reconstituted, and a biliary polarity is recovered: the Golgi elements, which are scattered throughout the cytoplasm in the isolated cells, are reassembled in front of the newly formed bile canalculi, symmetrically in the adjacent cells; lysosomes are concentrated in that region, and microtubules reappear. Concomitantly, plasma membrane differentiations, namely desmosomes and tight junctions, develop. Tight junctions sealing the bile ducts constitute a barrier to the passage of ruthenium red and horseradish peroxidase. De novo formation of these junctions was studied by the freeze-etching technique: 10-nm particles compose a network of anastomosed linear arrays in the vicinity of the bile canaliculi; in the next step of differentiation, the particles fuse, form short ridge segments and finally continuous branched smooth strands, characteristic of the mature tight junction.

Rats were treated for 5 days with benfluorex [1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-[N-(2-benzoyloxyethyl)amino]propane] or with suspending medium (controls). They were then intubated with an acute intoxicating dose of ethanol or with glucose of equivalent energy content. Treatment of the control rats with ethanol specifically increases the hepatic activity of the soluble phosphatidate phosphohydrolase by about 5-fold in 6 h. The equivalent increase for the benfluorex-treated rats were about 2-fold. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of ethanol and benfluorex on glycerolipid synthesis.

Feeding rats with sorbitol, fructose, glycerol and ethanol increases the concentration of serum corticosterone without significantly altering the concentration of insulin. This increase appears to be partly responsible for the increases in the hepatic activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (compared with rats fed glucose or 0.9% NaCl) that has been reported [Sturton, Pritchard, Han & Brindley (1978) Biochem. J. 174, 667--670] and the enhanced capacity of the liver to synthesize triacylglycerols. The ethanol-induced increase in phosphohydrolase activity was largely, but not completely, prevented by adrenalectomy.

1. The metabolism of [1-14C]palmitate in rat liver was studied in a single-pass perfusion system at concentrations of 0.2 or 1 mM. 2. After the perfusion the liver was homogenized and the floating fat was isolated. The incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into triacylglycerol in this pool increased 9-fold when the palmitate concentration in the medium was increased from 0.2 to 1 mM. In time studies with 1 mM-[1-14C]palmitate 75% of the total accumulation of triacylglycerol occurred in this pool. Our results support the concept that the floating-fat fraction contains the storage pool of triacylglycerol, i.e. the cytoplasmic lipid droplets. 3. In a particulate preparation consisting mainly of mitochondria and microsomal fraction the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into triacylglycerol was proportional to the fatty acid concentration. Triacylglycerol in the perfusate medium and in the particulate fraction was in isotopic equilibrium, which indicates that the particulate fraction contained the precursor pool for secreted triacylglycerol, i.e. the pool in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. 4. The oxidation to labelled water-soluble products and to CO2 was increased 14-fold by the 5-fold increase in palmitate concentration.	Metabolism of palmitate in perfused rat liver.

1. The effect of ethanol on the metabolism of [1-14C]palmitate in rat liver was investigated in a single-pass perfusion system at concentrations of 10mm- or 80mm-ethanol and 0.2mm- or 1mm-palmitate. 2. After the perfusion the hepatic lipid was isolated in subcellular fractions. The two major fractions contained triacylglycerol from cytoplasmic lipid droplets and from endoplasmic reticulum plus Golgi apparatus respectively. 3. In experiments with 0.2mm-palmitate perfusion with 10mm- or 80mm-ethanol did not measurably increase the esterification, and the oxidation was markedly decreased and the fatty acid uptake was not affected. 4. Perfusion with ethanol, at 1mm-palmitate, increased the fatty acid uptake, increased esterification and decreased oxidation. The effects of 10mm- and 80mm-ethanol were similar. The incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into triacylglycerol in cytoplasmic lipid droplets was not affected statistically significantly by ethanol. Ethanol increased the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitate into di- and tri-acylglycerol in the membranous fraction. Estimated chemically, the contents of di- and tri-acylglycerol were only slightly affected by ethanol. These results suggest that the effect of ethanol was to increase the turnover of fatty acids in triacylglycerol rather than to increase its accumulation. 5. The results indicate that an increased concentration of fatty acids is more important for the formation of acute fatty liver in fed rats than are the direct effects of ethanol on hepatic fatty acid metabolism.

1. Rats were treated for 4 weeks with liquid diets that contained, on the basis of energy content, 35% fat, 18% protein and 47% carbohydrate (high-fat diet) or 35% fat, 18% protein, 11% carbohydrate and 36% ethanol (high-fat/ethanol diet). 2. The livers were perfused with 1mm-[1-14C]palmitate and with 0, 10mm- or 80mm-ethanol. The oxidation and esterification of palmitate was measured. Two subcellular pools of triacylglycerol were separated; one contained triacylglycerol from cytoplasmic lipid droplets and the other contained triacylglycerol from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. 3. In the presence of ethanol, liver from rats fed on the high-fat diet esterified about 70% of the [1-14C]palmitate taken up compared with 90% in liver from rats fed chow (containing 11% fat on the basis of energy content). Compared with chow diet the high-fat diet did not potentiate the effect of ethanol on storage of [1-14C]palmitate in hepatic triacylglycerol. The relation between the fat content of the diet and the degree of fatty liver induced by by ethanol [Lieber & DeCarli (1970) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 23, 474–478] is discussed. 4. The ethanol-containing diet increased the hepatic content of triacylglycerol 4-fold and the increase was exclusively found in the fraction suggested to contain lipid from cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The ethanol-induced fatty liver, perfused with ethanol, esterified and oxidized palmitate at rates that were quite similar to the rates found in high-fat control livers perfused without ethanol. This suggests that the fatty liver had adapted to the presence of ethanol with respect to palmitate metabolism. 5. O2 and ethanol uptake by the livers were not affected by the ethanol-containing diet.	Metabolism of palmitate in perfused rat liver.

The effect of insulin on hepatic triglyceride synthesis and secretion is controversial. Previously, we have described a cell culture system of adult rat hepatocytes that synthesize and secrete very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides with small and irreproducible effects of insulin on triglyceride metabolism. To study the primary effects of insulin on hepatic triglyceride metabolism a method was developed utilizing fibronectin-coated culture dishes that allowed adhesion, spreading, and maintenance of hepatocytes for 2-3 d in the absence of serum and insulin. This culture system allowed mass measurements of both cellular and secreted VLDL triglycerides for long time periods after the addition of physiological concentrations of insulin to hormone-free culture medium. In the absence of insulin and after an initial 4 h in culture, the medium was replenished and triglyceride mass was measured at the end of 18-h incubations. VLDL triglyceride accumulated in the culture medium at a linear rate over this time-course with increasing accumulation as the medium glucose concentration was raised from 2.5 to 25 mM glucose (1.77±0.24 to 3.09±0.76 μg triglyceride/mg cell protein per h). There was no apparent significant lipolysis or hepatocellular reuptake of secreted VLDL triglycerides. In the absence of insulin cellular triglyceride levels were unchanged between 3 and 24 h in culture while insulin (50-500 μU/ml) significantly increased cellular triglyceride content at all glucose concentrations tested (0-25 mM). The addition of insulin to the culture medium progressively reduced the rate of VLDL triglyceride secretion accompanied by an increase in cellular triglyceride at insulin concentrations > 50 μU/ml. Most or all of the observed increase in cell triglyceride content could in all experiments be accounted for by the insulin-induced inhibition of VLDL secretion. Incorporation of [2-3H]glycerol into cellular and VLDL triglycerides as a function of insulin concentration was also measured. Glycerol incorporation data at 20-22 h after plating of the cells closely paralleled the insulin-induced changes in cellular and VLDL triglyceride as determined by mass analysis. The observed effects of insulin occurred at concentrations close to the physiological range and suggest that the direct hepatic effect is to suppress VLDL secretion although the net effect in vivo will clearly reflect many additional accompanying changes.

l-Lysine (2mm) causes an increase (mean 60%) in the rate of gluconeogenesis from lactate in isolated liver cells. The effect is of a catalytic nature. No other amino acid has the same effect, though ornithine is slightly active. The effect is additional to the stimulatory effects of oleate and of dibutyryl cyclic AMP.

"The structure of the longitudinal body muscles of Branchiostoma caribaeum has been studied by light and electron microscopy. These muscles are shown to be composed of fibers in the form of flat lamellae about 0.8µ in thickness, more than 100 µ wide, and reaching in length from one intermuscular septum to the next, a distance of about 0.6 mm. Each flat fiber is covered by a plasma membrane and contains a single myofibril consisting of myofilaments packed in the interdigitating hexagonal array characteristic of vertebrate striated muscle. Little or no sarcoplasmic reticulum is present. Mitochondria are found infrequently and have a tubular internal structure. These morphological observations are discussed in relation to a proposed hypothesis of excitation-contraction coupling. It is pointed out that the maximum distance from surface to myofilament in these muscles is about 0.5 µ and that diffusion of an ""activating"" substance over this distance would essentially be complete in less than 0.5 msec. after its release from the plasma membrane. It is concluded that the flat form of amphioxus muscle substitutes for the specialized mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling thought possibly to involve the sarcoplasmic reticulum in higher vertebrate muscles."

Activity of myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase was demonstrated histochemically at a fine structural level in isolated, unfixed or hydroxyadipaldehyde-fixed cardiac myofibrils in the rat, using a lead precipitation technique and either Ca++ or Mg++ as activating ion. Activity in relaxed myofibrils was found in the A band, but not the H, I, or Z bands. Deposits of final product frequently exhibited an axial periodicity of near 365 A, and bore a close relationship to filaments within the A band. Several patterns of distribution occurred in contracted myofibrils. In myofibrils which had shortened to the point of disappearance of the I band, final product was distributed throughout the sarcomere, except for the unreactive Z band. A second type of distribution occurred in strongly contracted fibers in which there was intensification of activity in the center of the sarcomere. These findings are discussed in the light of the recent morphological evidence and it is suggested that the distribution of final product is consistent with localization of enzyme activity to the cross-bridges between the thick and thin filaments.

In vitro studies of the transport of colloidal particles by the cornea were carried out on intact corneas of adult rabbits in a chamber described by Donn, Maurice, and Mills (2) in which the epithelial or the endothelial surface of the cornea was exposed to thorium dioxide or saccharated iron oxide under various conditions. These studies confirmed the results of previous work in vivo and allowed modification of the experimental conditions. Particles are pinocytosed at the apical surface of the corneal endothelium and carried around the terminal bar in membrane-bounded vesicles. Basal to the terminal bar these vesicles fuse with the lateral cell margin and their contents are released into the intercellular space, in which they appear to be carried by a one-way flow down to Descemet's membrane and the corneal stroma. Indications that the endothelial transport is an active process are presented by the different pathways of transport into or out of the corneal stroma, as well as by the approximately 70 per cent reduction in transport activity at low temperatures.

Physiological studies have demonstrated that ions, as well as large molecules such as hemoglobin or fluorescein, can diffuse across and within the cornea. Most of the substrates for corneal metabolism are obtained from aqueous humor filling the anterior chamber. In order to receive its nutrients and in order to maintain its normal conditions of hydration, the avascular cornea must transport relatively large amounts of solute and solvent across the cellular layers which cover this structure. It has been suggested in the past that there may be a morphological basis for the transport of large amounts of solvents and solutes by cells by the mechanism of pinocytosis. The use of electron-opaque markers to study fluid movements at the electron microscope magnification level was described by Wissig (29). The present study describes the fine structure of the normal rabbit cornea and the pathways of transport of colloidal particles by the cornea in vivo. Rabbit corneas were exposed in vivo to suspensions of saccharated iron oxide, thorium dioxide, or ferritin by injection of the material into the anterior chamber. In other experiments thorium dioxide or saccharated iron oxide was injected into the corneal stroma, producing a small bleb. Particles presented at the aqueous humor surface of the rabbit corneal endothelium are first attached to the cell surface and then pinocytosed. It appears that the particles are carried around the terminal bar by an intracellular pathway involving the pinocytosis of the particles and their subsequent transport in vesicles to the lateral cell margin basal to the terminal bar. Particles introduced at the basal surface of the endothelium (via blebs in the corneal stroma) are apparently carried through the endothelial cells in membrane-bounded vesicles without appearing in the intercellular space. There appears to be free diffusion of these particles through Descemet's membrane and the corneal stroma. The stromal cells take up large quantities of the particles when blebs are injected into the stroma.	STUDIES ON THE CORNEA I.

An electron microscope study of sheep myocardial cells has demonstrated the presence of a transverse tubular system, apparently forming a network across the cell at each Z band level. The walls of these tubules resemble the sarcolemma in consisting of two dense layers—plasma membrane and basement menbrane; continuity of the tubule walls with the sarcolemma can be seen when longitudinal sections of a cell are obtained between two subsarcolemmal myofibrils and at the same time perpendicular to the cell surface. The demonstration of communication between the lumen of the transverse tubular system and the extracellular space appears to be more definite in this study than in any work hitherto published. It provides anatomical evidence of a possible direct pathway for transmission of the activating impulse from the sarcolemma to the myofibril Z bands.

An electron microscopic study of rabbit and human myocardium provides further evidence of the existence of two distinct components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A thin-walled tubular system (termed longitudinal system) is arranged in anastomosing channels sur-surrounding each sarcomere and has transverse and possibly also longitudinal connections with the tubules of adjacent sarcomeres. A thick-walled tubular system traverses the myofiber transversely at the level of the Z lines of the myofibrils. The structure of these tubules very closely resembles that of deep sarcolemmal invaginations. Indeed, the membranes of the tubules appear to be continuous with the sarcolemma in favorable sections so that there seems to be an extension of the cell membrane and extracellular fluid to all depths of the myocardial fiber. Certain physiologic data which support this concept are discussed. The calculations of A. V. Hill comparing the kinetics of diffusion and the time-distance relationships between excitation and activation in frog sartorius muscle are reconsidered for cardiac muscle.

Chains of vesicles are prominent near the plasma membranes of both the neurons and satellite cells of osmium-fixed toad spinal ganglia. In permanganate-fixed specimens, however, such vesicles are absent, and in their place are continuous invaginations of the plasma membranes of these cells. The discrepancy suggests that the serried vesicles seen in osmium-fixed preparations arise through disintegration of plasma membrane invaginations, and do not represent active pinocytosis, as has been suggested previously. A second difference between ganglia fixed by these two methods is that rows of small, disconnected cytoplasmic globules occur in the sheaths of permanganate-fixed ganglia, but not in osmium-fixed samples. It is suggested that these globules arise from the breakdown of thin sheets of satellite cell cytoplasm which occur as continuous lamellae in osmium-fixed specimens. Possible mechanisms of these membrane reorganizations, and the relevance of these findings to other tissues, are discussed.

Analysis of various platelet proteins by immunofluorescence demonstrated that platelet glycoproteins Ib, IIb, and IIIa, as well as plasma factor VIII antigen (factor VIII:AGN), platelet factor 4, and fibronectin are present in the vast majority of morphologically recognizable megakaryocytes. In addition, a small number of lymphoid- like mononuclear marrow cells, representing approximately 1.4-- 2.9/10(4) marrow cells, was found to express the same platelet proteins. This population of early marrow megakaryocytes is analogous to small acetylcholinesterase-positive rat and mouse marrow cells. Fc receptors for IgG were expressed in all megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte precursors, whereas the Ia antigen was detected only on a proportion of mature megakaryocytes and not on only early or precursor megakaryocytes. Platelet glycoproteins Ib, IIb, and IIIa, as well as factor VIII:AGN, and platelet factor 4 were established as distinct markers for marrow megakaryocytes and may be helpful for identifying megakaryocytic cells as well as for monitoring events of megakaryocyte differentiation.

The value of mean platelet volume in the prediction of the haemostatic potential of thrombocytopenic patients was investigated in 175 patients with haematological disorders who underwent 1473 blood counts over five months. Eighty-four haemorrhagic episodes were detected, most in thrombocytopenic patients. The mean platelet volume of patients with haemorrhagic tendency was significantly lower (5.52 +/- SD 0.7 fl) than that of patients without these tendencies (7.87 +/- SD 1.75 fl) (p less than 0.001). In cases of severe thrombocytopenia (less than 20 x 10(9)/1 platelets) haemorrhagic episodes were frequent; however, the frequency of bleeding was considerably lower in cases in which the mean platelet volume was higher than a suggested cut-off point of 6.4 fl. Discriminant analysis selected mean platelet volume as more important than platelet count for prediction of haemorrhagic state in severe thrombocytopenia. In view of the useful discrimination that mean platelet volume provides between thrombocytopenic patients who bleed and those who do not bleed, it may serve as a guide to predict the danger of haemorrhage and the need for prophylactic platelet transfusion.

1 The pharmacological effects of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin on human and rabbit platelets were examined. 2 EDRF is released from porcine aortic endothelial cells, cultured on microcarriers and treated with indomethacin, in sufficient quantities to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by 9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methano epoxy-prostaglandin F2 alpha (U46619) and collagen. 3 The anti-aggregating activity of EDRF was potentiated by M&B 22948, a selective inhibitor of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, and by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and was inhibited by haemoglobin and Fe2+. 4 Both NO and prostacyclin inhibited platelet aggregation. 5 The anti-aggregatory activity of NO, but not that of prostacyclin, was potentiated by M&B 22948 and by SOD and was inhibited by haemoglobin and Fe2+. Thus NO is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation whose activity on platelets mimics that of EDRF. 6 It is likely that the inhibitory effect of NO on platelets represents the action of endogenous EDRF and therefore this substance, together with prostacyclin, is a regulator of platelet-vessel wall interactions.

Methods have been devised to harvest megakaryocytes from guinea pig femoral marrow and to isolate them in high yield. When marrow tissue was disaggregated the megakaryocytes underwent degenerative changes characterized by the loss of cytoplasmic granules and alterations in membrane topography, similar to the changes seen in aggregating platelets. These morphologic changes were interpreted to mean that megakaryocytes possessed functional attributes of platelets. The use of agents which inhibit platelt aggregation (0.38% sodium citrate. 10(-3) M adenosine, and 2 x 10(-3) M theophylline) in a medium free of bivalent cations prevented these changes. This solution resulted in both an excellent morphologic preservation and a significantly increased recovery of megakaryocytes from marrow tissue. A two-step purification of the intact megakaryocytes was carried out on the basis of their low density and large size, with equilibrium density gradient centrifugation followed by velocity sedimentation. This sequence gave approximately a 100-fold enrichment of megakaryocytes, significantly better than that achieved with either method alone. These techniques for harvesting and concentrating megakaryocytes make it possible for the first time to study megakaryocytes in vitro.

The redistribution of beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), platelet Factor 4 (PF4), and fibrinogen from the alpha granules of the platelet after stimulation with thrombin was studied by morphologic and immunocytochemical techniques. The use of tannic acid stain and quick- freeze techniques revealed several thrombin-induced morphologic changes. First, the normally discoid platelet became rounder in form, with filopodia, and the granules clustered in its center. The granules then fused with one another and with elements of the surface-connected canalicular system (SCCS) to form large vacuoles in the center of the cell and near the periphery. Neither these vacuoles nor the alpha granules appeared to fuse with the plasma membrane, but the vacuoles were connected to the extracellular space by wide necks, presumably formed by enlargement of the narrow necks connecting the SCCS to the surface of the unstimulated cell. The presence of fibrinogen, beta TG, and PF4 in corresponding large intracellular vacuoles and along the platelet plasma membrane after thrombin stimulation was demonstrated by immunocytochemical techniques in saponin-permeabilized and nonpermeabilized platelets. Immunocytochemical labeling of the three proteins on frozen thin sections of thrombin-stimulated platelets confirmed these findings and showed that all three proteins reached the plasma membrane by the same pathway. We conclude that thrombin stimulation of platelets causes at least some of the fibrinogen, beta TG, and PF4 stored in their alpha granules to be redistributed to their plasma membranes by way of surface-connected vacuoles formed by fusion of the alpha granules with elements of the SCCS.

Platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a distinct molecular alteration of the plasma membrane surface, namely decreased amounts of a major glycoprotein designated as IIb (apparent mol wt 142,000). To identify other possible surface defects of thrombasthenic platelets, we labeled the membrane polypeptides of normal and thrombasthenic platelets by two different techniques: lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and galactose oxidase oxidation, followed by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride. Labeling patterns were determined after the polypeptides were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Before the second dimension was run, platelet samples were incubated with a reducing agent, β-mercapto-ethanol, to cleave the disulfide bonds of certain glycoproteins; the resulting changes in electrophoretic mobility permitted better resolution of individual molecules. Comparison of the labeled polypeptides of normal and thrombasthenic samples after reduction indicated decreased labeling of two major glycoproteins in thrombasthenic platelets: IIb and III (apparent mol wt 114,000). The relative proportions of radioactivity incorporated by these polypeptides were about 60 and 80% less than control values, respectively. With either Coomassie Blue or periodic acid-Schiff's reagent, glycoprotein III stained much less intensely in thrombasthenic compared to normal samples, indicating that the observed labeling deficit was caused by a decreased concentration of the molecule rather than steric inaccessibility on the membrane surface. Analysis of normal plasma membranes by affinity chromatography showed that glycoprotein IIb has receptors for lectin from Lens culinaris, the common lentil, whereas III does not. We conclude that a characteristic feature of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is a decreased concentration of two discrete glycoproteins in the platelet plasma membrane.Images	Platelet Membrane Defects in Glanzmann's ThrombastheniaEVIDENCE FOR DECREASED AMOUNTS OF TWO MAJOR GLYCOPROTEINS	David R.

Human B lymphocyte antigens analogous to the murine Ia determinants were found on myeloblasts and promyelocytes but not on more mature granulocytes. This was apparent by fluorescent staining with both human alloantisera and rabbit antisera to the isolated Ia-like proteins. The cells of patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia showed this difference especially clearly. Separation of the myeloblasts and promyelocytes by multistep density gradient fractionation produced a marked enrichment of the positive cells. The remaining cells from higher density fractions were more-mature neutrophils that were essentially negative. In acute myeloid leukemia, in which myeloid cells early in differentiation predominate, the vast majority of cells were strongly positive. Similar results were obtained with normal bone marrow cells. Here also, only the early forms of the myeloid series separated by gradient centrifugation had Ia antigens. Evidence was also obtained for the presence of Ia determinants on cells with the appearance of early erythroid precursors. Support for the presence of the Ia determinants on granulocyte-macrophage committed stem cells was provided by the inhibition of granulocyte colony formation in agar cultures following preincubation of normal bone marrow with antiserum and complement.Cross absorptions with purified preparations of immature cells provided evidence for the close similarity of the antigenic determinants on both myeloblasts and B cells. A 28,000-37,000-dalton bimolecular complex obtained from myeloblast membranes contained the Ia determinants and was similar to that obtained from peripheral blood B cell membranes.Images	Expression of Ia-like antigen molecules on human granulocytes during early phases of differentiation	R.

Analysis of four mature cell markers on mouse bone marrow leukocytes grown in vitro, demonstrated a distinct sequence of marker appearance during the terminal phases of granulocytic cell differentiation. A similar pattern of marker expression was also suggested by analysis of mature neutrophils and macrophages isolated from normal tissues. Among cultured neutrophils, receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcR) were first expressed on myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and then subsequently on more mature cells. Morphologically mature colony neutrophils (polymorphs) from agar cultures contained only FcR and complement receptor type two (CR(2)) (C3d receptor), and lacked both complement receptor type one (CR(1)) (C3b receptor) and the capacity to ingest latex, bacteria, or iron particles. Neutrophils from 2 and 3 wk liquid media cultures of marrow cells differed from agar grown neutrophils in that they had phagocytic capacity (particle ingestion) [Pi] in addition to FcR and CR(2). Furthermore, in the 4th and 5th wk of these continuous liquid cultures, CR(1) was also expressed, completing the surface marker profile of normal blood neutrophils. Based on these studies, the following order of appearance of these four markers on cells from the myelocytic series was proposed: FcR {arrow} FcR CR(2) {arrow} FcR CR(2) Pi {arrow} FcR CR(2) Pi CR(1). Differential studies of tissue leukocytes containing these same markers revealed that a heterogeneity existed among morphologically mature neutrophils. Even though 95 percent of blood polymorphs contained all four markers, the same was true of only half of spleen polymorphs and only 20 percent of bone marrow polymorphs. Cells of the monocyte-macrophage series were studies in parallel with neutrophils. Cultured marrow monocytes acquired the four mature cell markers so rapidly that the order of receptor appearance could not be determined. However, it was found that CR2 was lost during the terminal phase of monocyte maturation into activated macrophages.	Membrane receptors of mouse leukocytes. II.

Incubation with Ia antiserum, followed by complement, markedly inhibited erythroid colonies arising from hematopoietic cells present in the nonadherent low density fractions of normal bone marrow. Both erythropoietin-dependent colonies and bursts were eliminated at dilutions of antiserum equivalent to, or greater than the dilutions required to abolish the granulocyte-macrophage colony formation. The inhibitory effect of the Ia antiserum was abolished by absorption with B but not T cells from lymphoid lines. Available evidence suggested that Ia determinants are expressed on the erythropoietin-sensitive progenitors of the erythroid series in precise analogy to their sequence of expression on the granulocyte lineage. In both lineages, as shown previously, the Ia determinants become undetectable during subsequent stages of differentiation.

Human marrow megakaryocytes have been isolated with high purity and yield by processing marrow cells sequentially through density centrifugation and velocity sedimentation. Analysis of the isolated cells for various platelet-associated components by immunofluorescence demonstrated that fibrinogen, plasma factor VIII antigen (factor VIII:AGN) platelet myosin, platelet glycoproteins I and III are present on the membrane and in the cytoplasm of over 90% of marrow megakaryocytes. Parallel studies of human and mouse megakaryocytes and platelets for IgG receptor (FcR), complement receptor type one (CR1) (C3b receptor), complement receptor type two (CR2) (C3d receptor), and Ia antigen by fluorescence and (or) rosette formation methods were performed. FcR were present on most human megakaryocytes and platelets. The Ia antigen was detected on a proportion (10-15%) of human megakaryocytes but it was undetectable on human platelets. CR1 was found on 20-40% of mouse megakaryocytes and also on a proportion of mouse platelets. These differentiation markers may be of use in monitoring megakaryocyte maturation.	Human megakaryocytes.

The glycoprotein I complex, consisting of two polypeptides of Mr 210,000 and 150,000, was isolated from human platelet membranes by wheat germ lectin affinity chromatography. Glycocalicin, a soluble loosely bound membrane glycoprotein of Mr 150,000 related to the glycoprotein I system, was also purified. The isolated polypeptides were radioiodinated in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels and digested with trypsin, and the labeled peptide digest was analyzed by two-dimensional high-voltage electrophoresis and thin-layer chromatography. The two polypeptides of Mr 210,000 and 150,000 in the glycoprotein I complex had essentially identical radioactive peptide maps. Glycocalicin had a completely different tryptic peptide map. These studies shed light on the molecular relationships of some of the components of the platelet membrane glycoprotein I system. The possibility is raised that the receptorlike function of the intrinsic platelet membrane glycoproteins may be related to the polymeric subunit associations of the constituent polypeptides.Images	Structural analysis of human platelet membrane glycoprotein I complex.

We used the hybridoma technique to characterize further the platelet glycoprotein abnormality in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Spleen cells from Balb/c mice immunized with human platelets were fused to mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0-Ag14. Hybridoma lines producing a variety of antiplatelet antibodies were isolated by hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selection and cloned, and purified monoclonal IgG from six lines was prepared. One of these lines, 8aB5-9, produced an antibody, Tab, that binds to a protein on normal but not thrombasthenic platelets. We isolated this protein from Triton X-100 solubilized normal platelet membranes by affinity chromatography on Tab-Sepharose. As determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the isolated protein is a complex of glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, because the two subunits comigrate with glycoproteins IIb and IIIa of whole platelets and show identical changes in mobility after disulfide bond reduction. We prepared 125I-Tab to determine the number of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complexes on normal and thrombasthenic platelets by a direct binding assay. Platelets from 17 normal donors bound 39,000±4,600 (SD) Tab molecules/platelet. Platelets from four patients with thrombasthenia lacked Tab binding sites (<5%). Five obligate and four presumed heterozygotes for thrombasthenia bound 24,500±5,800 Tab molecules/platelet. The platelet alloantigen, PlAl, is not that recognized by Tab, because platelets from three PlAl-negative subjects bound Tab normally. Studies with the Tab antibody have (a) enabled quantitation of the number of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complexes on normal platelet membranes, (b) demonstrated that thrombasthenic homozygotes lack and heterozygotes have a partial deficiency of this complex, and (c) made possible the isolation of this membrane protein which may be required for normal platelet aggregation and clot retraction.Images	Isolation and Quantitation of the Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein Deficient in Thrombasthenia Using a Monoclonal Hybridoma Antibody	Rodger P.

Human platelets have been separated into two extreme density populations by centrifugation in specific density media. A large-heavy platelet population with specific gravity > 1.055 and a light-small population with specific gravity < 1.046 were obtained, each representing approximately 15-20% of the total population volume. The average volume per platelet of the separated large-heavy and light-small platelet populations was 12 and 5 μ3 respectively. When data are expressed per milliliter platelets or per gram wet weight, the large-heavy platelet population had a 2-fold greater glycogen content, 1.3-fold greater orthophosphate content, 1.3-fold greater total adenine nucleotide content, 4.2-fold greater rate of glycogenolysis, 2.6-fold greater rate of glycolysis, 2.9-fold greater rate of protein synthesis, and 5.7-fold greater rate of glycogen synthesis. Significant differences were not obtained with respect to total lipid content or total lipid synthesis. The large-heavy platelet had a 2.5-fold greater resistance to osmotic shock as measured by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) release.These data, as well as diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP32) survival curves in rabbits, indicate that large-heavy platelets have a greater metabolic potential and suggest that they may be the young platelets which progress with age to light-small platelets with a diminished metabolic potential.

In the previous communication, suggestive evidence was presented for large-heavy platelets being “young” platelets and light-small platelets being “old” platelets. Large-heavy, light-small, and total human platelet populations were compared with respect to their platelet function. After addition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, or epinephrine, platelet aggregation time was 3.0-, 4.5-, and 3.3-fold shorter with large-heavy platelets compared with light-small platelets, and large-heavy platelets released 3.7-, 7.6-, and 8.1-fold greater adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the medium, respectively, than did light-small platelets. After platelet aggregation by thrombin or epinephrine, large-heavy platelets released 6.0- and 3.8-fold more ADP into the medium than did light-small platelets. After platelet aggregation by ADP, light-small platelets consumed 5.9-fold greater added extracellular ADP than did large-heavy platelets.Large-heavy platelets aggregated by ADP, thrombin, or epinephrine released 9.1-, 8.5-, and 12.7-fold greater platelet factor 4 than light-small platelets similarly treated.

The site of synthesis of platelet-specific proteins remains to be established. With the use of short-term megakaryocyte-enriched cultures, direct evidence was obtained to show that megakaryocytes synthesize the platelet-specific protein, platelet factor 4. A megakaryocyte-enriched fraction of rabbit bone marrow for culture was obtained by centrifugal elutriation and cultured with [3H]leucine. Newly synthesized 3H-platelet factor 4 was sought by copurification with added carrier rabbit platelet factor 4, using heparin agarose affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with specific goat anti- rabbit platelet factor 4 antisera. SDS PAGE of the washed immunoprecipitates demonstrated a [3H]leucine-containing peak which migrated identically with purified homogeneous rabbit platelet factor 4. A second, slightly larger molecular-weight protein was identified in the gels also, suggesting that rabbit platelet factor 4 may be synthesized as a larger molecular-weight precursor in rabbit megakaryocytes. These results provide direct evidence that the platelet- specific protein, platelet factor 4, is synthesized in rabbit megakaryocytes before it is packaged into alpha-granules for release in circulating platelets.

Selected monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) isolated after immunization of rats with a human colonic carcinoma membrane preparation, have been screened on frozen and paraffin sections of colonic tissue, using immunohistochemical techniques, in order to provide additional information with regard to specificity and crossreactivity with normal tissues.Of 10 McAbs previously shown to bind to a colonic carcinoma membrane preparation in a radioimmunoassay, 7 show specific staining when tested by indirect immunofluorescence on crysotat sections of colonic tissue. Three of these 7 show activity on both normal and malignant colonic epithelium, and the remaining 4 stain normal epithelium, with little or no activity on malignant tissue. In the indirect immunofluorescent and immunoperoxidase techniques on paraffin sections of the same material, only 2 McAbs retain activity; one detects an antigen in colonic mucus, and the other recognises an antigen which is sparse on normal colonic epithelium and abundant on colonic tumours.We conclude that screening of McAbs on frozen tissue sections, using indirect immunofluorescence, is a useful adjunct to conventional screening methods, e.g. binding to membrane preparations and/or cell lines in a radioimmunoassay. These techniques distinguish McAbs with similar binding values in conventional assays, identify their activity on a wide range of normal and malignant tissues, demonstrate antigens that are lost or gained in malignant transformation and finally assist in the selection of McAbs for further extensive study before possible clinical use.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3	Immunohistochemical techniques in the early screening of monoclonal antibodies to human colonic epithelium	P.

Intimal lesion formation was investigated in rats made thrombocytopenic by a single i.p. injection of a polyclonal antibody made against rat platelets that reduced circulating platelet counts to less than 1% of normal. The carotid artery was then denuded of endothelium with a 2 French balloon catheter, after which no platelets were found adhering to the exposed subendothelium. In control animals, platelets adhered instantly to the denuded artery. Six hours after denudation mRNA for ornithine decarboxylase, a marker for early G1 events, was found to be elevated in both thrombocytopenic and control arteries. Two days after injury the smooth muscle cell replication rate in thrombocytopenic rats was found to be significantly elevated as compared with that in uninjured carotids (13.7% +/- 8.4% vs. 0.65% +/- 0.23%) but was similar to the replication rate observed in denuded carotid arteries from animals treated with nonimmune IgG. One important difference between these animals was that no intimal thickening was observed in thrombocytopenic animals at day 4, and by day 7 the intimas were still significantly smaller than those from control rats. In a separate group of animals which were thrombocytopenic for the entire experiment, no intimal lesions were observed 7 days after injury by balloon catheter. From these results, we conclude that platelets do not play a role in the initiation of smooth muscle cell proliferation after injury by balloon catheter but may regulate their movement into the intima.Images	Role of platelets in smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration after vascular injury in rat carotid artery.

"A polyclonal antiserum to platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa was used to detect antigenically related molecules on a diverse panel of human cells. Umbilical vein endothelial cells, erythroleukemic HEL cells, and diploid fetal lung GM1380 fibroblasts expressed GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules, as judged by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled proteins. The GPIIb and GPIIIa subunits were both present and were of similar molecular weight in these cell types. These molecules were synthetic products of the cells, as shown by immunoprecipitation of intrinsically labeled proteins. Promyeloid U937 cells could be induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to synthesize and express GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules on their cell surface. The GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules were not precisely identical in the various cell types, based on slight differences in electrophoretic mobility and their failure to react with monoclonal antibodies specific for each subunit of platelet GPIIb/IIIa. These results suggest the existence of a widely distributed family of GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules. This family of ""cytoadhesins"" may share a common function in cellular adhesive reactions.Images"	Immunologic relationship between platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa and cell surface molecules expressed by a variety of cells.

The regulatory action of activators for protein kinase C on the specific binding capacity for recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was studied on various human cell lines. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and oleyl acetyl glycerol (OAG) both are able to rapidly downregulate TNF-binding capacity of normal and malignant cells derived from various tissues. As PMA treatment did not enhance internalization of TNF-alpha-receptor complexes at 37 degrees C, and since OAG was able to downregulate TNF-binding capacity under conditions where internalization and shedding of receptor protein are prevented, we conclude that protein kinase C controls ligand affinity of the TNF-receptor protein, possibly via direct phosphorylation. Protein kinase C triggered downregulation of TNF-alpha-binding capacity concomitantly resulted in reduction of TNF-alpha sensitivity, as revealed from decreased cytotoxic action of TNF-alpha on L 929 cells and from inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated enhancement of HLA class II antigen expression in Colo 205 cells. Restoration of TNF-binding capacity upon abrogation of protein kinase C stimulation leads to full recovery of TNF responsiveness, further supporting the close linkage of TNF-receptor expression and TNF sensitivity. These data suggest that regulation of TNF-binding capacity by protein kinase C is one of the cellular control mechanisms of TNF responsiveness.

Human platelets contain the cuprozinc (cytoplasmic) and manganese (mitochondrial) forms of superoxide dismutase. Nevertheless, superoxide radicals were detectable in the surrounding medium of metabolically viable platelet suspensions by using two assay systems: cytochrome c and nitroblue tetrazolium. The quantity of superoxide generated by platelets (5 X 10(5) superoxide radicals/platelet per 10 min) was constant and did not increase after aggregation by agents such as collagen and thrombin. The superoxide-generating system was present in the supernate of both aggregated and resting platelets and therefore was not platelet-bound. Platelet superoxide production was unaffected by prior ingestion of aspirin, indicating that the prostaglandin and thromboxane pathways were not involved. Both resting and aggregated platelets exhibited a reductive capacity toward cytochrome c and nitroblue tetrazolium which was unrelated to superoxide production. Furthermore, the aggregation process always resulted in a marked increase in this reduction. The nonsuperoxide reduction associated with aggregation was found to be membrane bound and to decrease with an apparent first order reaction rate (k1 = 0.067 min-1). In addition, accumulative, time-dependent nonsuperoxide-related cytochrome c reduction was also detected. Since there is no superoxide dismutase in plasma, the presence of superoxide radicals in the surrounding medium of platelets may have in vitro significance for platelet and leukocyte concentration and storage and in vivo significance for hemostasis, coagulation, and thrombosis. The nonsuperoxide-related reducing activities may represent a biochemical basis for platelet-blood vessel interactions, with particular reference to blood vessel integrity.Images	Superoxide production and reducing activity in human platelets.

A cascade superfusion technique has been developed for the differential bioassay of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) released from porcine aortic endothelial cells cultured on microcarriers, packed into a column and perfused. Bradykinin (Bk; 20-100 nM) released prostacyclin (9.6 +/- 1.5 nM per 10(6) cells; mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 9) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 2.1 +/- 0.6 nM per 10(6) cells) from the column measured by relaxation of strips of bovine coronary artery (BCA) and rabbit mesenteric or coeliac artery, respectively. The presence of these prostanoids in the effluent was confirmed by specific radioimmunoassays. A23187 (500-2000 nM) also released both prostacyclin and PGE2 from the cells. This release was long-lasting and not reproducible. Bk (20-100 nM) and A23187 (30-300 nM) released EDRF from the column. This was detected in a cascade of four rabbit aortic strips (RbA), denuded of endothelium and contracted with U46619 or phenylephrine. The relaxation of the RbA strips caused by EDRF was progressively attenuated down the cascade (half-life less than 7s) and was not affected by indomethacin. EDRF and prostacyclin could be differentially bioassayed in a cascade of alternating RbAs and BCAs as prostacyclin did not relax RbAs and the time delay to the BCAs destroys EDRF. EDRF could be bioassayed on its own when the endothelial cells were treated with indomethacin. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 0.2, noradrenaline 1.0, platelet-activating factor (Paf-acether) 1.0, formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine 1.0, acetylcholine 0.5, bethanecol 0.5, adenosine diphosphate 0.25 and angiotensin II 0.1 microM did not release either prostanoids or EDRF from the column.ImagesFigure 1	Bioassay of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from porcine aortic endothelial cells.

We report here a factor (B cell growth factor) found in induced supernatants of the mouse thymoma EL4 that co-stimulates with anti-IgM antibodies in short-term cultures of purified B lymphocytes to induce polyclonal B cell proliferation but not antibody-forming cell production. The factor is not mitogenic for resting B cells and interacts with anti-IgM-activated B cells in a non-H-2-restricted manner. Absorption studies and molecular weight analysis reveal the factor is distinct from interleukin 2. This factor synergises with antigen, interleukin 2, and an interleukin 2-free, B cell growth factor- free T cell supernatant that contains T cell-replacing factor to produce erythrocyte-specific plaque-forming cells in cultures of highly purified B cells.

Secondary murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses from alloantigen- primed T cells can be induced in vitro by apparently unrelated regimens, such as addition of either concanavalin A (Con A), conditioned medium from Con A stimulated lymphocyte cultures, conditioned medium from secondary mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), or stimulator cells sharing only the I-region with the stimulating cells used for primary sensitization. We now report that upon polyclonal (Con A), or antigen-specific (MLC) stimulation, Lyl+ T cells release a factor, which in turn triggers alloantigen primed Ly23+ T cells to proliferation and cytolytic activity. The secondary cytotoxic T lymphocyte inducing factor (SCIF) is produced within 24 h. For its production, an intact protein metabolism, not DNA metabolism, is required. Once induced, the functional activity of SCIF is nonspecific and not H-2 restricted. SCIF allows exponential growth and long-term propagation of cytolytic Ly23+ T cells with specificity to alloantigens used for primary sensitization. SCIF induced activation of alloantigen primed Ly23+ T cells does not require the presence of alloantigens. The results therefore reveal a process by which Lyl+ T-cell-derived nonspecific factor(s) induce autonomously Ly23+ T-cell-mediated, antigen-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.

When microtubules are fixed in glutaraldehyde in the presence of tannic acid and thin sections cut, the subunit structure of the microtubule is readily observed without the need of image reinforcement. Seven types of microtubules were analyzed: those in the heliozoan axoneme, the mitotic apparatus, the contractile axostyle, repolymerized microtubules derived from the chick brain, the central pair in flagella, and the A tubules of flagella and the basal body. In all cases microtubules were composed of 13 equally spaced protofilaments. The B tubules in flagella and the basal body appear to be composed of 11 subunits. The connections of the B to the A and the C to the B are described. A model of a microtubule is presented.	MICROTUBULES: EVIDENCE FOR 13 PROTOFILAMENTS	Lewis G. Tilney, Joseph Bryan, Doris J.

Frozen, thin sections of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were incubated with either concanavalin A (Con A) or Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA) to localize specific oligosaccharide moieties in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes. These lectins were then visualized using an anti-lectin antibody followed by protein A conjugated to colloidal gold. All Golgi cisternae and all ER membranes were uniformly labeled by Con A. In contrast, RCA gave a uniform labeling of only half to three-quarters of those cisternae on the trans side of the Golgi stack; one or two cis Golgi cisternae and all ER membranes were essentially unlabeled. This pattern of lectin labeling was not affected by infection of the cells with Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Infected cells transport only viral spike glycoproteins from their site of synthesis in the ER to the cell surface via the stacks of Golgi cisternae where many of the simple oligosaccharids on the spike proteins are converted to complex ones (Green, J., G. Griffiths, D. Louvard, P. Quinn, and G. Warren. 1981. J. Mol. Biol. 152:663-698). It is these complex oligosaccharides that were shown, by immunoblotting experiments, to be specifically recognized by RCA. Loss of spike proteins from Golgi cisternae after cycloheximide treatment (Green et al.) was accompanied by a 50% decrease in the level of RCA binding. Hence, about half of the RCA bound to Golgi membranes in thin sections was bound to spike proteins bearing complex oligosaccharides and these were restricted to the trans part of the Golgi stack. Our results strongly suggest that complex oligosaccharides are constructed in trans Golgi cisternae and that the overall movement of spike proteins is from the cis to the trans side of the Golgi stack.

Platelet degranulation is a characteristic feature of platelet response to aggregating agents, but the mechanism and route by which secretory organelles are transferred to plasma are still uncertain. In the present study, human platelets were incubated with cytochalasin B, an agent which stabilizes discoid shape, and trypsin, which is known to cause release reaction and degranulation. Platelets treated in this manner retained their disc form, but were nearly devoid of granules and dense bodies. Electron-dense tracers indicated that degranulation was accomplished by fusion of secretory organelles with channels of the open canalicular system. The degranulated discoid platelet appears to survive exposure to cytochalasin B and trypsin and may prove to be a useful model for in vivo and in vitro experimental studies.ImagesFig 3 and 4Fig 1Fig 2Fig 5Fig 6	Degranulation of Discoid Platelets	James G.

The blood platelet release reaction involves the secretion, in parallel, of specific chemical constituents stored in intracellular organelles to the plasma without loss of substances suggestive of cell damage. The present investigation has employed an unusual effect of cationic polypeptides to follow the platelet secretory process. When platelets were incubated with polybrene and polylysine, the agents were taken up and deposited in cytoplasmic organelles. The matrix of granules developed a lattice-like substructure not produced by other chemical agents, and dark zones of granules and dense bodies became more electron opaque. Subsequently, the platelets exposed to cationic polypeptides underwent the shape change and internal transformation similar to that produced by potent aggregating agents. Granules and dense bodies appeared in the open canalicular system and were extruded in a relatively intact state from the altered platelets. No differences were observed in the response of normal, afibrinogenemic or thrombasthenic platelets to incubation with polybrene and polylysine. The results indicate that cationic polypeptides can stimulate the extrusion of secretory organelles, and support the previous reports suggesting that channels of the open canalicular system serve as conduits for discharging the products of the release reaction.ImagesFigs 1A-1EFigs 2A-2FFigs 3A-3F	Exocytosis of Secretory Organelles from Blood Platelets Incubated with Cationic Polypeptides	James G.

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the active principle of croton oil, is a potent platelet aggregating agent. Previous cytochemical and electron microscopic studies demonstrated that PMA caused selective labilization of platelet storage granules resulting in their conversion to distended vacuoles. Communication was established between the enlarged, almost empty vacuoles and the surrounding plasma through channels of the open canalicular system. The present study has explored the possibility that the effect of PMA on platelet storage organelles stimulates a process of secretion. Analysis of the release reaction in platelets after exposure to PMA revealed that significant amounts of serotonin and adenine nucleotides were secreted without loss of lactic dehydrogenase. Release took place well before the onset of irreversible aggregation. Inhibitors of platelet secretion or ADP induced aggregation could modify or prevent the irreversible clumping stimulated by small concentrations of PMA. Although the secretion induced by PMA differed from the release caused by other agents, the findings of the present study indicate that PMA is capable of triggering the platelet release reaction.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Figs 3 and 4	Investigation of the Release Reaction in Platelets Exposed to Phorbol Myristate Acetate	James G.

The role of fibrinogen as a cofactor for platelet aggregation was examined by measuring the binding of 125I-labeled human fibrinogen to gel-filtered human platelets both before and after platelet stimulation by ADP and epinephrine. Platelet stimulation by ADP resulted in the rapid, reversible binding of fibrinogen to receptors on the platelet surface. Fibrinogen binding increased as the concentration of ADP was increased from 0.1 to 2 microM, reaching a plateau at higher ADP concentrations. Binding occurred only after platelet stimulation and in the presence of divalent cations. However, fibrinogen binding did not occur to ADP-stimulated platelets from three patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Analysis of fibrinogen binding as a function of increasing fibrinogen concentration demonstrated that maximal platelet stimulation exposed approximately or equal to 45,000 binding sites per platelet with a dissociation constant of 80--170 nM. These fibrinogen binding parameters were essentially the same whether ADP or epinephrine was the platelet-stimulating agent. Thus, these studies demonstrate that platelet stimulation by ADP and epinephrine exposes a limited number of fibrinogen receptors on the platelet surface. Furthermore, these data suggest that the fibrinogen molecules bound to the platelet as a consequence of platelet stimulation are directly involved in the platelet aggregation response.Images	Exposure of platelet fibrinogen receptors by ADP and epinephrine.

Fibronectins (fn) are adhesive glycoproteins which bind to collagen and to fibrin and appear to be important in cellular adhesion to other cells or surfaces. Fn-related antigen is present in human platelets, suggesting a possible role for fn in the adhesive properties of platelets. We have studied the localization of fn in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets by immunofluorescence and quantitative binding of radiolabeled antibody. In resting fixed platelets, variable light surface staining for fn was observed. When these cells were made permeable to antibody with detergent, staining for fn was markedly enhanced and was present in a punctate distribution, suggesting intracellular localization. Stimulation with thrombin, which is associated with increased platelet adhesiveness, resulted in increased staining for fn antigen on intact platelets. These stimulated cells did not leak 51Cr nor did they stain for F-actin, thus documenting that the increased fn staining was not due to loss of plasma membrane integrity. The thrombin-induced increase in accessible platelet fn antigen was confirmed by quantitative antibody binding studies in which thrombin-stimulated platelets specifically bound 15 times as much radiolabeled F(ab')2 anti-fn as did resting cells. Thus, thrombin stimulation results in increased expression of fn antigen on the platelet surface. Here it may participate in interactions with fibrin, connective tissue, or other cells.Images	Thrombin increases expression of fibronectin antigen on the platelet surface.

"The mechanism by which platelets endocytose or release particulate or soluble substances is poorly understood. Engulfed materials enter the open canalicular system (OCS) by a process akin to phagocytosis, but fusion of platelet granules with the OCS is rarely observed. Secretion of granule contents, a concomitant of the ""release reaction"" which occurs during platelet aggregation, does not take place by extrusion at the surface membrane as is true for other secretory cells. Some substances may be secreted without obvious granule loss. To examine whether structural properties of the platelet membrane could account for this unusual behavior, thin section and freeze-fracture analyses were performed on platelets which had undergone endocytosis under a variety of experimental conditions. After freeze-cleavage, most of the intramembranous particles (IMP) remain associated with the outer leaflet of the platelet plasma membrane. The sites where the OCS reaches the surface membrane are marked by pits on the cytoplasmic leaflet (P face) and by complementary protrusions on the outer leaflet (E face) of the membrane. Endocytosis of small particles and solutes takes place via these structures. This process is not energy dependent but arrested at 4 degrees C. Distension of the OCS does not appear to affect the size or number of the pits. On the other hand, large particles are taken up by membrane invagination without redistribution of IMP's and independent of the pits. This process is sensitive to metabolic inhibition. Thus, the studies have demonstrated the existence of two different pathways for platelet endocytosis which are postulated to be also involved in secretion. The selective release of substances contained in different granules may be related to the ""inside-out"" structure of the plasma and OCS membranes."

In addition to HL-A antigens, another cell surface protein complex has been obtained from membranes of the human B-lymphoblast cell line IM-1. This complex which was solubilized with papain, consisted of polypeptides of 23,000 and 30,000 daltons (p23, 30). Rabbit antisera to this material precipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled detergent- solubilized cells, three proteins of 39,000, 34,000, and 29,000 daltons. These antisera were specifically cytotoxic for B lymphocytes of peripheral blood, for B-lymphoblast cell lines, and for EAC rosette receptor-positive surface Ig-negative (Null) lymphocytes. The p23,30 complex was not present on T lymphocytes, EAC rosette receptor-negative Null lymphocytes, or platelets. In addition, the p23,30 complex from several cell lines inhibited alloantisera from multiparous Amish women which had been shown to recognize non-HL-A, B-lymphocyte antigens. Some other properties of the anti-p23,30 sera antisera were described.	Isolation and immunologic characterization of a human. B-lymphocyte- specific, cell surface antigen		58959	1976-07-01	4	
Recent evidence suggests that a short-lived product of prostaglandin biosynthesis produced on the addition of arachidonic acid to platelet microsomes is involved in physiologic platelet aggregation and mediates the release reaction by producing the platelet contractile wave. An important corollary of this hypothesis is that aspirin and indomethacin, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, should block the platelet contractile process produced by agents which can initiate platelet aggregation. The present study tested this hypothesis and found that aspirin and indomethacin were, indeed, potent inhibitors of the platelet contractile wave stimulated by collagen and epinephrine, but largely failed to inhibit internal transformation induced by thrombin and ADP. The findings confirm the hypothesis that a prostaglandin produced endogenously by platelets initiates platelet contraction and suggests that ADP and thrombin have the ability to stimulate the platelet contractile apparatus by an alternate mechanism not dependent on prostaglandin synthesis.ImagesFigure 2Figure 3Figures 4A-DFigure 1	The influence of aspirin and indomethacin on the platelet contractile wave.

Human platelets in plasma were subjected to freeze fracture followed by etching. The outer surface of the platelet plasma membrane was exposed by etching but not by fracturing and was clearly identified by use of latex particles as markers. Surface-associated particles, apparently embedded in the plasma membrane, were found to measure from 83 to 332 Å in diameter. Similar particles were associated with membranes lining the surface-connected canalicular system and with limiting membranes of storage granules. Fortuitous fractures exposed two inner faces of the plasma membrane, one of which contained greater numbers of surface-associated particles than did the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The second inner face of the plasma membrane contained numerous fibrillar structures measuring up to 770 Å in length. Platelets from a congenitally afibrinogenemic patient appeared normal when examined by freeze-etch technics. Normal platelets exposed to a potent antiaggregating agent (REM 10,393) were found to have lost most of the particles associated with the outer surface of the plasma membrane and to have developed numerous defects in this membrane. A possible role for surface associated particles in platelet aggregation was further suggested by the finding that the nonaggregable platelets of two congenitally thrombasthenic sisters were nearly devoid of these structures.ImagesFig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 1Fig 2Fig 7Fig 8Fig 9	Freeze-Etch Observations on the Plasma Membrane and Other Structures of Normal and Abnormal Platelets	R.

Cationic polypeptides are known to cause the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin gel and the immediate aggregation of blood platelets. In the present study, the effects of the cationic polypeptides, polybrene and polylysine, on normal, afibrinogenemic and thrombasthenic platelets were examined by nephelometry and electron microscopy. Normal and afibrinogenemic platelets aggregated rapidly and irreversibly after exposure to either agent. Thus, fibrinogen was not an essential factor for the interaction, though it may facilitate the rate of clumping produced by polybrene or polylysine. Thrombasthenic platelets did not aggregate rapidly or irreversibly in the presence of either agent. Shape change and slight degrees of clumping were induced by the cationic substances, a response essentially identical to the reaction of thrombasthenic platelets to collagen. The failure of cationic polypeptides to cause immediate aggregation of thrombasthenic platelets was not due to a failure of the agents to interact with the abnormal cells. Electron microscopy revealed that normal, afibrinogenemic and thrombasthenic platelets all adsorbed polybrene and polylysine, and transferred the agents to intracellular organelles.ImagesFig 3Fig 4Fig 1Fig 2	Effects of Cationic Polypeptides on Thrombasthenic and Afibrinogenemic Blood Platelets	James G.

Reaction of human neutrophils with aggregated immunoglobulin on nonphagocytosable surfaces results in secretion of granule enzymes (exocytosis of granules) and stimulation of glucose oxidation by the nexose monophosphate pathway (HMP). The role of HMP stimulation in the enzyme secretion and some requirements for the two neutrophil activities have been examined. It was found that (a) HMP stimulation could be selectively inhibited under conditions where release of granule enzymes remained unchanged or was enhanced, for example, by reduced glucose concentration or by 2-deoxyglucose. (b) Removal of Ca++ and addition of agents which increased the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), however, prevented both activities, while colchicine had greater inhibitory activity on HMP stimulation than upon secretion. (c) Neutrophils incubated in suspension with particulate aggregated gamma-globulin phagocytosed the particles and exhibited a stimulated HMP and released granule enzymes. In contrast, incubation in suspension with soluble aggregated gamma-globulin resulted in the stimulated HMP only. Granule evzymes were not liberated. 300-fold less soluble aggregates bound to a surface, however readily induced exocytosis of granules from adherent neutrophils. This demonstrates the importance of surface effects in the induction of secretion from neutrophils. Aggregated immunoglobulin reacting with neutrophil Fc receptors thus induces both degranulation (exocytosis) and increased HMP activity. The pathways leading to these events are separable although apparently sharing some common steps, including the initiating events.Images	Stimulation of human neutrophils by soluble and insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates.

Mouse bone marrow and spleen cells formed pure or mixed colonies of up to 80 megakaryocytes in agar cultures after stimulation by medium conditioned by activated mouse lymphoid cells. Megakaryocytes were identified on the basis of their morphology, polyploid mitoses and DNA content, and high cytoplasmic content of acetylcholinesterase. Megakaryocyte colony-forming cells were relatively small with a peak sedimentation velocity of 4.2 mm/hr. Spleen, lymph node, and thymus cells produced the factor stimulating megakaryocyte proliferation after culture in medium containing 2-mercaptoethanol, with or without added mitogens or allogeneic spleen cells. Peak activity in conditioning medium was associated with the small lymphocyte fractions in mouse spleen.Images	Growth of mouse megakaryocyte colonies in vitro.

Human mononuclear leukocytes were fractionated into populations of null, T and B cells by immunoabsorbent column chromatography followed by E-rosette formation and purification of T cells by differential centrifugation and osmotic lysis. The unfractionated and fractionated cell populations were first separately cultured for 14 days in plasma clots in the presence of two international units erythropoietin. Typical erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E)-derived colonies grew in the unfractionated cell cultures but not from T- or B-cell cultures. BFU-E colonies grew in null cell cultures but most of the colonies were small and variably hemoglobinized with less than three subcolonies. When intact T cells were added to null cells and cocultured, many typical large BFU-E colonies with more than 10 well homogenized subcolonies appeared. Increasing numbers of large BFU-E colonies in null cell cultures were induced by stepwise addition of T cells but not by the addition of B cells. A conditioned medium in which T cells had been induced to divide by tetanus toxoid substituted for intact T cells in this T-cell-dependent BFU-E colony formation observed in null cells. These findings demonstrate that the BFU-E, a committeded erythroid stem cell, resides in the null cell fraction of peripheral blood, but its proliferative capacity and differentiation in vitro requires a soluble product of T cells. Such experiments now permit a new approach to the assessment of various disorders of erythropoiesis. Erythroid hypoplasia in a particular case may be due to dysfunction of the committed precursor cell or to a failure of a helper effect induced by T cells.

Human platelets washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde aggregate in the presence of the antibiotic ristocetin and normal plasma. This aggregation response is abolished after digestion of the fixed platelets with chymotrypsin. Antisera to fixed washed platelets were produced in rabbits and absorbed with chymotrypsin-treated, fixed washed platelets. Monovalent Fab fragments obtained from the isolated gamma-globulin fractions of the antisera blocked ristocetin-induced aggregation of fixed washed platelets in buffer and normal platelets in platelet-rich plasma. By double-antibody immunoprecipitation, it was shown that the antibody which blocked the ristocetin reaction interacted with a platelet membrane surface protein of mol wt 155,000. The results suggest that the glycoprotein I complex on the surface of the human platelet mediates ristocetin-induced von Willebrand factor-dependent platelet aggregation.

Ia antigens and two different types of complement (C) receptors appeared on membrane surfaces in a distinct sequence during the maturation of human neutrophils. Taking advantage of the finding that neutrophil celll density increased with maturation, density gradient centrifugation was used to separate neutrophils into fractions that were greatly enriched in cells representing individual stages of differentiation. Myeloblasts, the earliest cells recognized in the myeloid series of both normal and myelogenous leukemic individuals, expressed Ia determinants, whereas Ia determinants were absent or diminished on the majority of promyelocytes and completely undetectable on more mature granulocytes. Double marker studies demonstrated that Ia determinants were lost from the membrane of developing myeloid cells before the appearance of any type of C receptor. In the next phase of maturation defined by surface markers, neutrophils acquired a CR2-type C receptor (C3d receptor) that was similar in specificity to CR2 of B lymphocytes. This stage of maturation approximately corresponded to the myelocyte-metamyelocyte stage defined by standard morphologic criteria, and preceded the third stage of surface marker maturation when developing neutrophils began to express CR1-type C receptors (immune adherence, C4b-C3b receptors) in addition to CR2. In the final stage of surface marker-defined maturation, CR2 was lost from high density polymorphonuclear neutrophils and CR1 was maximally expressed. Normal blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils contained only 17% of CR2-bearing cells and these were shown to be of lower density than the majority of neutrophils that expressed only CR1. There  was some variation in the correlation of surface marker expression and maturation stage defined by morphologic criteria, but in all cases the sequence of marker appearance was the same: Ia leads to CR2 leads to CR1CR2 leads to CR1.

Platelets from two patients with Bernard-Soulier disease showed a reduction in their ability to bind human thrombin. Thrombin binding studies in the high affinity range showed 1,500 sites for the Bernard-Soulier platelets as against 4,000 for normal controls. However, the dissociation constant was the same for both normals and patients (4.4 nM) indicating identical affinity for thrombin at the available sites. In the low affinity range, the Bernard-Soulier platelets showed 8,800 thrombin binding sites as against 24,000 for the controls, but again with identical values of Kd (37 nM). In addition, platelets from these Bernard-Soulier patients showed a decreased rate of aggregation with thrombin at both optimal (300 mU/ml) and suboptimal (60 and 120 mU/ml) thrombin concentrations. The decreased amount of thrombin which can bind to Bernard-Soulier platelets and the decrease in thrombin-induced aggregation may partly explain the hemostatic defect in these patients. In addition, the identical ratios of high affinity and low affinity binding sites in normals and in patients (0.37 and 0.36, and 0.36, respectively) supports the idea of a single class of binding sites for thrombin on the platelet surface.

The antibiotic ristocetin only aggregates platelets in the presence of plasma von Willebrand factor. Platelets from patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome do not aggregate upon addition of ristocetin although, in contrast to von Willebrand's disease, plasma levels of factor VIII complex (factor VIII clotting activity, von Willebrand factor activity, and von Willebrand antigen) are normal. The membrane surface of normal platelets was modified and compared to the surface of platelets from a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome in an attempt to identify the receptor involved in von Willebrand factor-ristocetin-induced aggregation. After the incubation of washed normal platelets with a preparation of ristocetin previously shown to contain a proteolytic contaminant, the aggregation response is significantly decreased on addition or normal plasma. Analaysis by gel electrophoresis of such platelets when stained for carbohydrate revealed a decrease in the relative amounts of membrane glycopro-eins. Chymotrypsin-treated normal platelets had less membrane glycoproteins in addition to giving a reduced aggregation response in ristocetin-induced aggregation. Staining of gels for protein and carbohydrate indicated that there was an extensive change in the surface of Bernard-Soulier platelets, whereas those from patients with von Willebrand's disease appeared the same as normal. Platelets from patients were labeled by the lactoperoxidase iodination technique. Not only was the relative intensity of staining of platelet-specific proteins and glycoproteins changed in Bernard-Soulier platelets, but the iodination of the glycoproteins on the membrane surface relative to other membrane constituents was lower. In contrast, platelets from patients with von Willebrand's disease showed a normal exposure of membrane components. These data suggest therefore that membrane glycoproteins may play a functional role in ristocetin-induced aggregation.Images	Platelet membrane glycoproteins implicated in ristocetin-induced aggregation.

Expression of a Platelet-specific alloantigen (PlA1) was studied in five unrelated patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia using immunologic techniques based on release of 51Cr from tagged platelets by PlA1-specific antibody. Less than 1% of the normal quantity of PlA1 could be detected on platelets of patients 1, 2, and 3; platelets from patients 4 and 5 contained 22 and 12% of normal levels, respectively. After treatment with bromelain, platelets from patients 4 and 5, but not those from patients 1, 2, and 3, released 51Cr as well as normal PlA1-positive platelets when exposed to anti-PlA1. Platelets from each of the five patients reacted normally with drug-dependent antibodies and with autoantibodies specific for platelets.Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of thrombasthenic platelets showed marked deficiencies of glycoproteins IIbα and III (P < 0.0005), confirming recent reports of others. Deficiency of the two proteins as determined by gel scanning was more pronounced in patients 1, 2, and 3 than in patients 4 and 5. Normal levels of glycoproteins IIbα and III were found in platelets from normal subjects negative for PlA1.These observations are consistent with the possibility that the PlA1 antigen is located on one or both of the glycoproteins lacking in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, although other explanations are possible. They further suggest that patients with thrombasthenia may be heterogeneous in respect to the degree to which these glycoproteins are deleted. The PlA1 antigen can be measured with considerable precision and may provide a marker useful for the diagnosis and study of Glanzmann's disease.

Blood platelets contain a variety of contractile protein species, including the glycoprotein alpha-actinin, which is found at the Z disc in skeletal muscle cells. In the present study, we have considered the possibility that alpha-actinin might be one of several previously described platelet surface glycoproteins. Purified anti-alpha-actinin antibody was found to react strongly with partially purified platelet glycoprotein III, weakly with platelet glycoprotein IIb, and not at all with platelet glycoproteins Ib and IV. Platelets from three siblings with thrombasthenia, a disorder characterized by severe deficiency of platelet glycoproteins IIb and III, were found also to be equally deficient in alpha-actinin. These findings indicate that alpha-actinin and glycoprotein III are identical and suggest that this protein may be an anchor point for actin on the inside of the membrane. Combined with ultrastructural studies of normal and thrombasthenic platelets, the new findings provide a clearer understanding of contraction in single cells and small aggregates.ImagesFigure 9Figure 10Figure 1Figure 2Figures 3-6Figure 11Figure 12Figures 13-14Figure 7Figure 8	alpha-Actinin deficiency in thrombasthenia: possible identity of alpha-actinin and glycoprotein III.

Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of Triton X-100 solubilized proteins from normal and abnormal platelets was performed with rabbit antibodies raised against normal platelets. In Bernard-Soulier platelets protein 13 was not detected, and neither the amphiphilic (probably GP Ib) nor the hydrophilic (glycocalicin) glycocalicin-related proteins were seen when monospecific antiglycocalicin antiserum was used. The most prominent precipitate, 16, and platelet fibrinogen, 24 were not detected in platelets of two patients with type I thrombasthenia, whereas in one patient with type II thrombasthenia fibrinogen was clearly detected, but the amount of protein 16 remained severely reduced. Protein 16 was heavily labeled after lactoperoxidase-catalyzed 125I iodination of normal platelets, and was precipitated by IgG-L, an alloantibody from a polytransfused thrombasthenic patient. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or protein 16 cut out from immunoplates showed two 125I-labeled glycoprotein bands, which migrate as GP IIb and GP IIIa. SDS-PAGE of 125I-labeled type I thrombasthenic platelets showed no periodic acid-Schiff bands or peaks of radioactivity in the GP IIb and GP IIIa regions, whereas in the GP I region both the periodic acid-Schiff band intensity and the radiolabeling were within the normal range. Autoradiography after crossed immunoelectrophoresis of iodinated thrombasthenic platelets showed that the bulk of radioactivity was bound to protein 17. This glycoprotein, which was also present in normal and Bernard-Soulier platelets, migrates in the GP I region on SDS-PAGE. Thus, the bulk of radioactivity observed in the GP I region after SDS-PAGE is associated with protein 17 and not with glycocalicin.Images	Immunochemical Evidence for Protein Abnormalities in Platelets from Patients with Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier Syndrome	Inger Hagen, Alan Nurden, Ole Jannik Bjerrum, Nils Olav Solum, Jacques Caen	7354135	1980-03-01	4	
Membrane glycoproteins that mediate platelet-platelet interactions were investigated by identifying those associated with the cytoskeletal structures from aggregated platelets. The cytoskeletal structures from washed platelets, thrombin-activated platelets (platelets incubated with thrombin in the presence of mM EDTA to prevent aggregation) and thrombin- aggregated platelets (platelets activated in the presence of mM Ca(++) were prepared by first treating platelet suspensions with 1 percent Triton X-100 and 5 mM EGTA and then isolating the insoluble residue by centrifugation. The readily identifiable structures in electron micrographs of the residue from washed platelets had the shape and dimensions of actin filaments. Analysis of this residue from washed platelets had the shape and dimensions of actin filaments. Analysis of this residue by SDS gel electrophoresis showed that it consisted primarily of three proteins: actin (mol wt = 43,000), myosin (mol wt = 200,000) and a high molecular weight polypeptide (mol wt = 255,000) which had properties indentical to actin-binding protein (filamin). When platelets are activated with thrombin in the presence of EDTA to prevent aggregation,  there was a marked increase in the amount of insoluble precipitate in the subsequent Triton extraction. Transmission electron microscopy showed that this residue not only contained the random array of actin filaments as seen above, but also organized structures from individual platelets which appeared as balls of electron-dense filamentous material approximately 1mum in diameter. SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis of the Triton residue of activated platelets showed that this preparation contained more actin, myosin and actin-binding protein than that from washed platelets plus polypeptides with mol wt of 56,000 and 90,000 and other minor polypeptides. Thus, thrombin activation appeared to increase polymerization of actin in association with other cytoskeletal proteins into structures that are observable after Triton extraction. The cytoskeletal structures from thrombin-aggregated platelets were similar to those from thrombin-activated platelets, except that the structural elements from individual platelets remained aggregated rather than randomly dispersed in the actin filaments. This suggested that the membrane components that mediate the direct interaction of platelets were in Triton residue from aggregated platelets. Only a small percentage of the membrane surface proteins and glycoproteins were found in the cytoskeletal structures from either washed platelets or thrombin-activated platelets. In contrast, the aggregated cytoskeletal structures from thrombin-aggregated platelets contained membrane glycoproteins IIb (26 percent of the total in pre-extracted platelets) and III (14 percent), suggesting that one or both of these glycoproteins participate in the direct interaction of platelets during aggregation.

Growth factor activity, as determined by the stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of quiescent 3T3 cells in culture, was found in lysates of guinea pig platelets and megakaryocytes. Quantitative dilution studies demonstrated that, of the cells present in the guinea pig bone marrow, only the megakaryocyte possessed quantitatively significant growth factor activity. The amount of activity present in one megakaryocyte was equivalent to that present in 1,000-5,000 platelets, a value approximately comparable to the number of platelets shed from a single megakaryocyte. It is suggested that guinea pig platelet-derived growth factor has its origin in the megakaryocyte.	Origin of platelet-derived growth factor in megakaryocytes in guinea pigs.

Platelet factor 4 is shown to be a chemotactic protein for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes at concentrations found in human serum and reached locally in injured tissue. The maximum chemotactic response to platelet factor 4 nearly equals that achieved with saturating concentrations of the chemotactic activity derived from the fifth component of human complement, C5. Cells desensitized to C5 chemotactic activity retain chemotactic responsiveness to platelet factor 4. Serum contains inhibitory capacity against the chemotactic activity associated with platelet factor 4. Our results suggest that the local release of platelet factor 4 may be an important stimulus attracting inflammatory cells to sites of blood vessel injury.

Eighteen mouse monoclonal antibodies were selected for reactivity with cell surface antigens of the immunizing human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28. Six distinct antigenic systems were defined by direct serological assays and absorption tests with a panel of 41 cell lines derived from normal and malignant human tissues. Biochemical analysis indicated that two of the antigens are glycoproteins with molecular sizes of 95,000 and 150,000 daltons (gp95 and gp150). Two other antigenic systems (O5 and the R24 group) are associated with heat-stable molecules having the characteristics of glycolipids. The remaining two antigens (M19 and R8) are heat labile, but molecular characterization has not been possible. Each of the antigenic systems has a distinctive pattern of distribution on various cell types, varying from a broad representation to a more restricted occurrence. O5 appears to be a species antigen, being present on virtually every human cell type tested. gp95, gp150, M19, and R8 are found on a characteristic proportion of melanomas, astrocytomas, and epithelial cancers and on normal kidney cells. The antigen defined by the R24 antibody has the most restricted distribution of all. Reactivity is found with melanomas and astrocytomas, whereas epithelial cell types, fibroblasts, and cells of hematopoietic origin lack R24. Although occurrence of gp95, gp150, M19, and R8 distinguishes a small subset of melanomas not expressing these antigens, R24 is found on all melanoma cells.Images	Cell surface antigens of human malignant melanoma: definition of six antigenic systems with mouse monoclonal antibodies.

This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms involved in fibromusculoelastic lesion formation produced by selective de-endothelialization by the intra-arterial balloon catheter technique in thrombocytopenic rabbits. Thrombocytopenia was induced and maintained for up to 30 days by daily injections fo highly specific sheep anti-rabbit platelet sera (APS). Evidence for re-endothelialization was obtained by i.v. Evans blue dye 30 min before sacrifice. Rabbits received daily injections of APS, which reduced the mean platelet count to 5,600/cm3; control animals received identically treated normal sheep sera on the same schedule, and had mean daily platelet counts of 363,000/cm3. Evaluation of intimal thickness was assessed by counting cell layers in semithin sections. Intimal thickening in aortae from rabbits treated with APS was strikingly suppressed, in contrast to those from normal sheep sera-treated animals which showed a mean intimal thickness of 18 cell layers within 28 days often after de-endothelialization. Re-endothelialization was not affected by APS treatment. These results indicate that the proliferation of smooth muscle cells is dramatically inhibited by reduction of platelets.Images	The effect of thrombocytopenia on experimental arteriosclerotic lesion formation in rabbits.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates both proliferation of fibroblasts and chemotaxis of leukocytes. In this study we compared the mitogenic and chemotactic activities of native PDGF and reduced PDGF. Reduction of PDGF (Mr = 32,000) to its constituent polypeptides (Mr = 14,000 and 17,000) caused a loss of the ability to stimulate proliferation of Balb/c 3T3 cells. However, reduced PDGF retained virtually all of its activity as a chemotactic agent for human neutrophils and monocytes. A half-maximal chemotactic response to both native and reduced PDGF occurred at a concentration of approximately 0.08 nM for neutrophils and 0.1 nM for monocytes. The maximal chemotactic response to reduced PDGF was at least as great as the maximal response to native PDGF. Both native and reduced PDGF stimulated the release of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucosaminidase, from neutrophils with a half-maximal response at less than 0.1 nM. However, the net maximum release of this enzyme by PDGF (and reduced PDGF) was significantly less than that stimulated by a maximal concentration of the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. These results indicate that different structural determinants are required for the proliferative response of 3T3 cells to PDGF and for the chemotactic response of leukocytes to PDGF.

The migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the intima of arteries following mechanical injury is thought to be initiated by vessel wall injury and release of growth factors, in particular the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, the mechanism by which SMC proliferation is regulated after platelet interaction with the vessel wall has ceased is unknown. Here we show that SMCs derived from the intima of injured rat arteries (intimal SMCs) are phenotypically distinct from SMCs from unmanipulated vessels (medial SMCs). Intimal SMCs secrete 5-fold greater amounts of PDGF-like activity into conditioned medium in culture, have fewer receptors for 125I-labeled PDGF, and are not mitogenically stimulated by exogenous purified PDGF. This study demonstrates that two SMC phenotypes can develop in the adult rat artery and suggests that SMC proliferation in vivo may be controlled, in part, by SMCs that produce PDGF-like molecules.Images	Production of platelet-derived growth factor-like molecules by cultured arterial smooth muscle cells accompanies proliferation after arterial injury.

Cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) can produce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-like molecules. This property raises the possibility that SMC-derived PDGFs function as autocrine/paracrine regulators in the formation and maintenance of the artery wall. In this study we have asked if levels of mRNAs directing synthesis of PDGF are modulated in aortic SMC during postnatal development. We report here that genes encoding PDGF A- and B-chain precursors are expressed at similar low levels in intact aortas from newborn and adult rats. Marked differences in regulation of transcript abundance of these genes were revealed when aortic SMC were grown in cell culture. PDGF B-chain transcripts accumulated in passaged newborn rat SMC but not adult rat SMC, whereas PDGF A-chain RNA was found in comparable amounts in SMC from both age groups. Similarly, SMC from newborn rats secreted at least 60-fold more PDGF-like activity into conditioned medium than did adult rat SMC. PDGF B-chain transcripts in newborn rat aortic SMC are short-lived and increased 5-fold by 3 hr after treatment with cycloheximide. In contrast, PDGF A-chain transcripts are more stable, and their constitutive levels were generally unaffected by cycloheximide. These results show that PDGF A- and B-chain genes are transcribed in the normal rat aorta and provide evidence for age-related change in the control of PDGF B-chain gene expression in aortic SMC. Independent regulation of transcript levels in cultured SMC leaves open the possibility that PDGFs of different composition (AA, AB, BB) play different roles in normal function of the artery wall.Images	Expression and developmental control of platelet-derived growth factor A-chain and B-chain/Sis genes in rat aortic smooth muscle cells.

We previously demonstrated that the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is transcribed in human atherosclerotic plaques, indicating that production of growth factors within plaques could occur during atherogenesis. However, since atherosclerotic plaques are composed of several cell types and three of these--macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells--can express the PDGF genes, the cell type responsible for PDGF gene expression was not clear. In the present study we explore further the expression of PDGF-A and -B and identify transcriptionally active cell types. We assayed PDGF-A and -B mRNA levels in dissected fractions of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and normal artery and then sequentially rehybridized these blots with three cDNA probes that recognize cell type-specific markers: fms for macrophages, von Willebrand factor for endothelial cells, and smooth muscle alpha-actin for smooth muscle cells. In plaques, PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin; PDGF-B expression correlated strongly with fms. PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin. In normal vessel wall, PDGF-A expression was high in the media and again correlated with smooth muscle actin, whereas PDGF-B expression was high in the adventitia. Since transcripts from both PDGF genes are found in normal artery where cell turnover is very low, we suggest that PDGF gene expression does not necessarily function to produce smooth muscle cell proliferation. We propose that these genes may have an important nonmitogenic, maintenance function in normal arterial tissue and in the atherosclerotic plaque.Images	Platelet-derived growth factor gene expression in human atherosclerotic plaques and normal artery wall.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mRNA, and mRNA for its receptor, have been localized to specific cell types within the human atherosclerotic plaque, using in situ hybridization. The predominant cell types found to express PDGF A and B chain mRNA are mesenchymal-appearing intimal cells and endothelial cells, respectively, with little or no expression detected in macrophages. The distribution of PDGF receptor mRNA containing cells was also examined and found to be localized predominantly in the plaque intima.Images	Platelet-derived growth factor mRNA detection in human atherosclerotic plaques by in situ hybridization.

Neutrophils and platelets are frequently present in glomeruli in immune glomerulonephritis (GN). No role for the platelet in acute neutrophil-mediated renal injury has been defined. We investigated a neutrophil-mediated model of subendothelial immune complex GN in the rat. Rats were platelet-depleted (mean platelet less than 10,000/microliter) with goat anti-platelet IgG before induction of GN by the renal artery perfusion of concanavalin A followed by anti-concanavalin A IgG. Platelet-depletion resulted in a significant reduction in albuminuria (7 +/- 2 vs. 55 +/- 10 mg/24 h) and fractional albumin excretion (0.045 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.410 +/- 0.09) compared with controls. The decrease in albuminuria was not due to differences in blood or glomerular neutrophil counts, complement, renal function, or glomerular antibody binding. Platelet-depleted rats had equivalent subendothelial deposits and glomerular endothelial cell injury but had minimal platelet infiltrates and fibrin deposition compared with controls. These studies demonstrate a role for platelets in mediating acute neutrophil-induced glomerular injury and proteinuria in this model of GN.Images	Platelets mediate neutrophil-dependent immune complex nephritis in the rat.

In a study comparing the in vitro effects of heparin and a low molecular weight heparinoid (Organon 10172) on aggregation of platelets from normal subjects, we have demonstrated that whereas heparin markedly enhances platelet aggregation induced by other aggregators and inhibits the anti-aggregatory effect of epoprostenol (prostacyclin, PGI2), heparinoid does not produce such effects. The use of heparinoid may thus have a significant advantage over that of heparin in situations where enhanced platelet aggregation is the main factor leading to thrombosis or where heparin treatment is followed by thrombocytopaenia.

The topographic relationships of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb and glycoprotein IIIa have been studied in stimulated and unstimulated human platelets using immunoelectron microscopy. An indirect approach with ferritin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit gamma-globulin was used to localize the rabbit antibody to glycoprotein IIIa. The second ultrastructural label was keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated directly to antibody to glycoprotein IIb. Using the double labels, it was demonstrated that glycoprotein IIb and glycoprotein IIIa were distributed randomly in the unstimulated platelet membrane. After platelet stimulation with thrombin, large clusters of glycoprotein IIb- glycoprotein IIIa complexes were formed. No complex formation between glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb was observed in control experiments. These observations suggest that thrombin stimulation initiates the specific glycoprotein IIb-glycoprotein IIIa macromolecular complex formation on the platelet surface, which may act as the active fibrinogen-binding site required for normal platelet aggregation.

We demonstrate that HEL, a human erythroleukemic cell line, has numerous megakaryocytic markers which were markedly enhanced following the addition of the inducers dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to the culture medium. Ultrastructural and cytochemical studies showed: (i) the presence of organelles morphologically resembling the platelet alpha-granules; and (ii) a peroxidase activity with the same characteristics as that specifically found in platelets. The platelet alpha-granule proteins (von Willebrand factor, platelet factor-4 and beta-thromboglobulin) were immunologically detected in the HEL cell cytoplasm and their amounts increased after induction. Of particular interest was the presence of platelet membrane proteins. A monoclonal antibody specific for glycoprotein Ib bound to HEL cells. Platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were identified on intact cells using specific antibodies in a binding assay or in cell lysates using either crossed immunoelectrophoresis or an immunoblotting procedure following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most HEL cells also expressed the platelet alloantigen PIA1. All of the platelet membrane proteins were present in higher amounts after induction. Glycophorin A, specific for the erythroid lineage, was also detected on HEL cells. Thus, while confirming the presence of erythroid markers, our studies provide evidence that the HEL cell line also expresses platelet antigens. As such, HEL cells represent a unique system with which to study the biosynthesis of platelet-specific proteins and glycoproteins.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

A tetrapeptide sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, is the minimal structure recognized by cells in the large, adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin. We now have defined the structural requirements for this cell recognition site by testing several synthetic variants of the active tetrapeptide sequence. The conservative substitutions of lysine for arginine, alanine for glycine, or glutamic acid for aspartic acid each resulted in abrogation of the cell attachment-promoting activity characteristic of the natural sequence. However, in the position of the serine residue, some alterations were compatible with activity. Assay of peptides containing the structure Arg-Gly-Asp-X (where X = another amino acid residue) showed that an Arg-Gly-Asp-Val sequence predicted to be present in some, but not all, fibronectin molecules as a result of alternative RNA splicings could potentially create a second cell attachment site in those fibronectin polypeptide chains carrying that sequence. Other proteins with potentially active Arg-Gly-Asp-X sequences include several proteins that are known to interact with the cell surface. Among these are various types of collagens, thrombin, and discoidin, a slime-mold protein that may be involved in cell aggregation. The result presented here show that the arginine, glycine, and aspartic acid residues are absolutely required for the cell recognition, and that the surrounding amino acids may play a role in the expression of cell attachment activity in fibronectin and other proteins having this sequence. We suggest, based on these data, that this recognition mechanism may be common to a number of biological systems.

We describe a new method for analyzing embryonic events dependent on a specific peptide recognition signal. A short, specific amino acid sequence in fibronectin has been implicated as a recognition site in fibronectin-mediated interactions. Fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin is competitively inhibited by certain synthetic peptides, including the decapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ser-Lys-Pro, which appears to contain the cell recognition sequence. We found that this peptide inhibited both amphibian gastrulation and avian neural crest cell migration in vivo, as well as the attachment and migration of neural crest cells in vitro. These processes are major cell migratory events previously suggested to involve fibronectin. Negative controls included another conserved fibronectin peptide from the collagen-binding region containing the sequence Cys-Gln-Asp-Ser-Glu-Thr-Arg-Thr-Phe-Tyr and another peptide. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic peptides directed at recognition sites in extracellular proteins as probes of morphogenetic processes, and they provide further support for the hypothesis that fibronectin is involved in gastrulation and neural crest cell migration.

To identify platelet surface structures involved in adhesion to collagen, the effect of 16 murine antiplatelet membrane hybridoma antibodies were tested in a defined, in vitro assay. Four of these antibodies inhibited platelet-collagen adhesion and reacted with a polypeptide with Mr approximately 125,000, as determined by immunoblots after gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Through detailed studies with one of these antibodies, the monoclonal antibody PMI-1, the relevant antigen was identified as platelet glycoprotein IIb alpha, based upon (a) co-migration with this glycoprotein in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and (b) co-purification by immunoaffinity chromatography with a protein with apparent Mr identical to that of glycoprotein III, under conditions in which glycoproteins IIb and III form a complex. Univalent antibody fragments prepared from monoclonal antibody PMI-1 inhibited greater than 80% of platelet-collagen adhesion, and inhibition was completely blocked by the immunopurified antigen. These results indicate that glycoprotein IIb participates in some aspect of platelet-collagen adhesion. In contrast, the purified antigen only partially neutralized a polyclonal antiserum that blocked platelet-collagen adhesion, to a maximum of approximately 25%, at saturating antigen concentrations. Thus, by these immunological criteria, glycoprotein IIb is not the only molecule involved in this process.

It has been suggested that fibrinogen (fg) or its physiological derivatives influence the motility and growth of endothelial cells (ECs), but direct support for this concept is still lacking. In the present study, the capacity of fg to interact with ECs and induce the migration of ECs was examined. The capacity of fg to induce EC migration was studied by means of a modification of the Boyden chamber technique. fg in the lower compartment of the chamber caused a time- and concentration-dependent migration of ECs across filters. fg present in equal concentrations above and below the filter increased EC migration, but the maximal effect invariably occurred in the presence of a gradient between the lower and the upper compartments. Trypsin or plasmin digestion of fg and preincubation of fg with Fab fragments from specific antibody completely abolished fg-induced EC migration. Dialysis of fg to eliminate small peptides that might contaminate the preparation did not modify fg-induced migration. Plasma obtained from healthy donors induced EC migration, but plasma from an afibrinogenemic patient was completely ineffective. The addition of purified fg to afibrinogenemic plasma restored plasma-induced EC migration. Plasmin degradation fragments D and E, of 100,000 and 50,000 mol wt, respectively, did not induce EC migration. However, fragment E caused dose-related inhibition of fg-induced EC migration Direct interaction of highly purified radioiodinated human fg with cultured human and bovine Ecs was observed. The binding was time dependent and plateaued at 10 min. Nonlabeled fg in a large molar excess inhibited the interaction, but unrelated proteins, including fibronectin, ovalbumin, and myoglobin, did not. Monospecific Fab fragments directed to fg inhibited binding by 38% at a 50 to 1 molar ratio whereas nonimmune Fab caused only 2% inhibition at a similar concentration. The binding of 125I-fg with ECs was saturable, and an apparent dissociation constant of 0.23 x 10(-6) M was estimated from binding isotherms. After 30 min of incubation the interaction between 125I-fg and the cells was completely reversible and displaceable by a large molar excess of unlabeled fg. Autoradiography of the display of EC-bound 125I on polyacrylamide gel showed the constitutive B beta- and gamma-chains of the fg molecule, with a partial loss of the A alpha-chain. Purified fragment E and E were tested for their capacity to inhibit fg binding. At a 1 to 400 125I-fg-to-fragment molar ratio, fragment E, which also inhibited migration, competed for binding by 44%, but fragment D was completely ineffective. These data show that fg may specifically associate with ECs and induce migration of these cells; it also appears that the structural requirement of this activity is located in the N-terminal part of the molecule.Images	Interaction between fibrinogen and cultured endothelial cells.

We have previously described a series of monoclonal antibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins. Two of the antibodies, B59.2 and B2.12, recognize the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. These two antibodies react specifically with glycoprotein (GP) IIIa, as shown by immunoblotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of solubilized platelet membranes. Monoclonal B2.12, but not B59.2, binds to cultured human endothelial cells obtained from umbilical vein, internal iliac artery, and inferior vena cava. At saturation approximately 100,000 binding sites were detected per human umbilical vein endothelial cell. When solubilized radioiodinated cells were chromatographed on a column of agarose-bound B2.12, a single radiolabeled protein was obtained whose apparent molecular weight is slightly larger than that of platelet GP IIIa. This protein incorporated [35S]methionine when endothelial cells were labeled metabolically. These results demonstrate that human endothelial cell membranes synthesize a protein immunologically related to platelet GP IIIa.Images	A monoclonal antibody to human platelet glycoprotein IIIa detects a related protein in cultured human endothelial cells.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis were used in the investigation of glycoproteins IIb/IIIa in platelets, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages from human blood. All techniques detected the glycoproteins in platelets but not in the mononuclear phagocytes. Similar results were obtained by immunochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against the platelet glycoproteins IIb/IIIa (revealed by a gold-labeled second antibody) which bound heavily to the platelet but not to the monocyte surface. The biochemical techniques used for the analysis of mononuclear phagocytes would have reliably detected the level of glycoproteins IIb/IIIa contributed by a 5% contamination with platelets, calculated on a per cell basis. We conclude that human monocytes and monocyte- derived macrophages lack glycoproteins IIb/IIIa. Our results further indicate that centrifugal elutriation yields monocyte preparations with minimal contamination by platelets. It seems likely that the positive results obtained by other authors were due to the presence of platelets or fragments on the monocytes.

Affinity chromatography was used to identify a cell surface receptor for the adhesive protein vitronectin. Detergent extracts of human osteosarcoma (MG-63) cells were chromatographed on either vitronectin-Sepharose or Sepharose linked to the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro, which includes the fibronectin cell attachment sequence Arg-Gly-Asp. Two cell surface proteins with apparent molecular mass of 125 and 115 kDa bound to both columns and were specifically eluted with a solution containing the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide. These proteins could be incorporated into phosphatidylcholine liposomes and mediated the specific binding of these liposomes to vitronectin but not to fibronectin. In contrast, liposomes containing a previously identified 140-kDa fibronectin receptor, which interacts with the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence in fibronectin, did not bind to vitronectin. Thus, the fibronectin and vitronectin receptors each recognize the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide but exhibit mutually exclusive reactivities toward fibronectin and vitronectin. These receptors appear to belong to a family of proteins that mediate cell substratum adhesion via related but subtly different specificities.Images	A 125/115-kDa cell surface receptor specific for vitronectin interacts with the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid adhesion sequence derived from fibronectin.

The cell substrate attachment (CSAT) antigen is an integral membrane glycoprotein complex that participates in the adhesion of cells to extracellular molecules. The CSAT monoclonal antibody, directed against this complex, inhibited adhesion of cardiac and tendon fibroblasts and skeletal myoblasts to both laminin and fibronectin, thus implicating the CSAT antigen in adhesion to these extracellular molecules. Equilibrium gel filtration was used to explore the hypothesis that the CSAT antigen functions as a cell surface receptor for both laminin and fibronectin. In this technique, designed for rapidly exchanging equilibria, the gel filtration column is pre-equilibrated with extracellular ligand to ensure receptor occupancy during its journey through the column. Both laminin and fibronectin formed complexes with the CSAT antigen. The association with laminin was inhibited by the CSAT monoclonal antibody; the associations with both fibronectin and laminin were inhibited by synthetic peptides containing the fibronectin cell-binding sequence. Estimates of the dissociation constants by equilibrium gel filtration agree well with those available from other measurements. This suggests that these associations are biologically significant. SDS PAGE showed that all three glycoproteins comprising the CSAT antigen were present in the antigen-ligand complexes. Gel filtration and velocity sedimentation were used to show that the three bands comprise and oligomeric complex, which provides an explanation for their functional association. The inhibition of adhesion by the CSAT monoclonal antibody and the association of the purified antigen with extracellular ligands are interpreted as strongly implicating the CSAT antigen as a receptor for both fibronectin and laminin and perhaps for other extracellular molecules as well.

The Arg-Gly-Asp sequence resides in the cell attachment region of fibronectin. Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides support fibroblast attachment, inhibit fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin, and inhibit fibronectin binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets. In view of the similarities between the binding of fibronectin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor to stimulated platelets, we have examined the effects of Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides on the interaction of these latter two adhesive proteins with platelets. Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro was used as a prototype peptide, and this hexapeptide inhibited fibrinogen binding to ADP and thrombin-stimulated platelets in the 10-200 microM range. The inhibition exceeded 90% at high concentrations of peptide and was observed in the presence of either calcium or magnesium. Platelet aggregation was also inhibited by the peptide in this dose range. The hexapeptide inhibited fibrinogen binding to platelets with receptors fixed in an exposed state, indicating direct interference with the ligand-platelet interaction. The peptide was 1/2 to 1/3rd as potent in inhibiting fibrinogen as fibronectin binding to platelets, but fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor binding were inhibited to an identical extent. Conservative amino acid substitutions for the arginine, glycine, or aspartic acid markedly reduced inhibitory activity and the Asp-Gly-Arg sequence was inactive. These results indicate that Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides can inhibit the binding of the three adhesive proteins to stimulated platelets, establishing a basic common feature between the interaction of these molecules with platelets.

Congenital absence of platelet glycoproteins IIb and IIIa (GPIIb and GPIIIa) results in a severe bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation and failure of fibrinogen to bind to platelets. GPIIb is a two-chain protein containing disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits. GPIIb and GPIIIa are present as a heterodimeric, noncovalent complex in the platelet plasma membrane and function as the fibrinogen receptor. To characterize synthesis of these two proteins, RNA isolated from a human leukemia cell line that contains GPIIb and GPIIIa was translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. Polyclonal antibodies specific for each protein immunoprecipitated distinct [35S]methionine-labeled precursors, indicating that GPIIb and GPIIIa are translated from separate mRNAs. Moreover, using specific antibodies against either intact unreduced GPIIb or the beta subunit, we obtained evidence for synthesis of a common polypeptide precursor for GPIIb alpha and GPIIb beta. Based on experiments using microsomal membranes, it appears that GPIIb is integrated into the platelet membrane with little or no cytoplasmic component. These results suggest that precursors of GPIIb and GPIIIa may be encoded by separate genes and that each precursor is processed before delivery to the plasma membrane.Images	Biogenesis of the platelet receptor for fibrinogen: evidence for separate precursors for glycoproteins IIb and IIIa.

A method has been devised for the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets. The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.Images	Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets: procedure and some applications.

A combination of immunological and biochemical methods were used to identify surface membrane components involved in cell-substratum adhesion. Broad-spectrum antiserum, prepared against surface membranes from hamster cells, induced reversible rounding and detachment of hamster fibroblasts from a substratum in vitro. This phenomenon was inhibited by Nonidet P-40 extracts of hamster cells. Therefore, an antibody neutralization assay was developed to detect the presence of antigen during the fractionation of Nonidet P-40 extracts of cells. After two differential precipitation steps, anion exchange chromatography, and sequential lectin affinity chromatography, a fraction greatly enriched in ability to block antiserum-induced changes in cell adhesion and appearance was isolated. Analysis of this fraction by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a highly restricted group of glycoproteins with Mr approximately 140,000. A lectin-purified glycoprotein fraction was used to raise a higher titer antiserum that was able to induce reversible rounding and detachment of cells from a substratum and, when immobilized on an antibody affinity column, was able to bind and release material capable of blocking antiserum-induced cell rounding. These methods have allowed us to focus attention on a restricted group of glycoproteins that are integral constituents of the surface membrane and which play some as yet undetermined role in the process of cell--substratum adhesion.Images	Membrane glycoproteins involved in cell--substratum adhesion.

Thrombin stimulation results in increased surface expression of endogeneous fibronectin and binding of plasma fibronectin to human platelets. Platelets of patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder, exhibit reduced thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, little or no clot retraction, and abnormal platelet spreading on glass surfaces. Thrombin stimulation of patient platelets from four thrombasthenic kindreds resulted in little fibronectin binding. Nevertheless, thrombin did induce serotonin secretion from these cells, indicating that stimulation was occurring. Thrombasthenic platelets did not inhibit thrombin-stimulated fibronectin binding to coincubated normal cells, suggesting that their defect was not due to the presence of a soluble inhibitor of fibronectin binding. Thrombin-stimulated afibrinogenemic platelets bound similar quantities of fibronectin to normal cells, indicating that the thrombasthenic deficit is not secondary to reduced fibrinogen content or binding. The thrombasthenic cells had an endogenous fibronectin content of 2.9 +/- 0.7 micrograms/10(9) platelets, whereas cells simultaneously prepared from five normal individuals contained 1.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/10(9) platelets, a statistically insignificant difference. Nevertheless, thrombin stimulation did not increase expression of endogeneous fibronectin antigen on the surface of the thrombasthenic platelets as judged by immunofluorescence. These defects in platelet fibronectin binding and surface expression may account for some of the manifestations of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.Images	Reduced surface expression and binding of fibronectin by thrombin-stimulated thrombasthenic platelets.

Four synthetic peptides that together constitute the cell attachment domain of fibronectin [Pierschbacher, M.D., Ruoslahti, E., Sundelin, J., Lind, P. & Peterson, P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9593-9597] were constructed and tested for their ability to induce cell attachment and spreading. One of these peptides, consisting of the 30 amino acid residues nearest the COOH terminus of the domain, contained all of the cell attachment activity of the whole domain. Under suitable conditions the peptide was approximately as active as intact fibronectin on a molar basis. The activity could be demonstrated by binding the peptide to polystyrene directly, or via albumin, or by coupling it to agarose beads. This synthetic peptide will be useful in the elucidation of the molecular details of the attachment of cells to fibronectin and could allow manipulation of the adhesive properties of cell culture surfaces and prosthetic materials.Images	Synthetic peptide with cell attachment activity of fibronectin.

Glanzmann thrombasthenia is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by the failure of platelets to aggregate in response to almost all stimuli. However, thrombasthenic platelets will aggregate with bovine and porcine von Willebrand factor (vWF) and will show normal ristocetin-induced binding and aggregation in the presence of human vWF. In contrast, we now report that the specific binding of vWF to the thrombin-stimulated platelets was less than 20% of normal in three patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Analysis of binding isotherms was based on the assumption of one class of binding sites for vWF on the platelet membrane. Double-reciprocal plots were used to calculate maximal binding at saturation and apparent dissociation constant (Kd). In nine normals, 2.82 +/- 0.64 micrograms (+/- SD) of vWF bound to 10(8) platelets at saturation, with Kd (+/- SD) = 3.65 +/- 1.23 micrograms/ml. In two patients with thrombasthenia binding was markedly decreased and did not approach saturation. In the third patient, binding at saturation corresponded to 0.21 micrograms per 10(8) platelets, with Kd = 3.93 micrograms/ml. These findings suggest that mechanisms underlying the vWF-platelet interaction are incompletely reflected in ristocetin-dependent assay systems. Moreover, these results, in addition to those previously reported for fibronectin, suggest that the platelet defect in Glanzmann thrombasthenia is not limited to decreased binding of fibrinogen but involves several glycoproteins that are known to interact with platelets.Images	Glanzmann thrombasthenia: deficient binding of von Willebrand factor to thrombin-stimulated platelets.

By means of an antiserum specific to the complex of the platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa we demonstrate here that monocytes and purified monocyte membranes share these glycoproteins with platelets. The monocyte glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex showed complete immunological identity with the platelet counterpart and, furthermore, dissociated after EDTA treatment exactly as did the platelet complex. In Glanzmann's thrombasthenia type I, monocytes as well as platelets lack this antigen completely.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.

Actin has been measured in subcellular fractions from Rat-1 fibroblasts and in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed Rat-1 cells (VIT), using the DNase 1 inhibition assay. The transformed cells showed a significant shift in the actin monomer (G)in equilibrium with polymer (F) equilibrium within the cell cytosol, and a significant increase in actin in the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal core in comparison with untransformed cells. This incorporation of actin into the cytoskeletal core fraction is associated with a change in filamentous actin assemblies from 'stress fibre' patterns to punctate filament aggregates. These differences have been correlated with changes in morphology, in actin, vinculin and alpha-actinin distribution, in adhesion plaque formation and with the production of pp60v-src-associated protein kinase activity in the transformed cells. Changes in actin distribution and its polymerization in response to src-gene expression may play an important role in the determination of the transformed cell characteristics.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2p471-aFigure 3Figure 4Figure 5	Effect of transformation by Rous sarcoma virus on the character and distribution of actin in Rat-1 fibroblasts: a biochemical and microscopical study.

125I-labeled TNF(LuKII) (tumor necrosis factor) binds specifically to human and mouse cell lines sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of TNF, but not to cells made resistant to TNF. TNF-sensitive cells have cell surface receptors with a high affinity for TNF(LuKII). Mouse TNF competes with TNF(LuKII) for receptor binding. Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded linear plots and suggests that TNF(LuKII) binds to homogeneous receptor sites. The number of TNF(LuKII) receptors on two TNF-sensitive cell lines is 200-300 per cell and the affinity constant of the receptor for TNF(LuKII) is approximately 1 X 10(-10) M.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proteinaceous toxin shed by stimulated myeloid cells. Murine TNF was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 1 mCi/nmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of monomer. 125I-labeled TNF (125I-TNF) retained complete cytotoxic activity and it was immunochemically identical to the native toxin in a quantitative immunoprecipitation assay. It could be shown by competition binding that 125I-TNF bound to intact L929 cells with a specificity equal to that of native toxin. The conditions of time, temperature, and concentration involved in equilibrium specific binding to intact cells were studied in detail. When binding was carried out at 4 degrees C for 18 hr, four cell lines sensitive to 125I-TNF cytotoxicity demonstrated high-affinity binding. The binding reached half-maximal level at 3 pM and saturated at 30 pM. These concentrations approximated those required for cell death. Scatchard analysis gave approximately 1000 sites per cell. J774.1 cells, the source of the toxin, demonstrated similar binding but were not sensitive to 125I-TNF cytotoxicity. Other sensitive cell lines and freshly extracted tumor cells showed specific binding at 3 pM. Normal lymphoid organ cell suspensions and two human tumorigenic cell lines were not sensitive and failed to demonstrate specific binding. 125I-TNF, covalently cross-linked to its receptor on sensitive L-M cells with disuccinimidyl suberate, was isolated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Two specific bands were identified. The most prominent band had a mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of 95 kDa and the second band had a molecular mass of 75 kDa. The presence of the binding site appears to be necessary but not sufficient to explain the sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic action of TNF.Images	Cellular receptor for 125I-labeled tumor necrosis factor: specific binding, affinity labeling, and relationship to sensitivity.

Highly purified, Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was labeled with 125I and employed to determine receptor binding, internalization, and intracellular degradation in murine L929 cells (highly sensitive to the cytotoxic action of TNF) and in diploid human FS-4 cells (resistant to TNF cytotoxicity). 125I-labeled TNF bound specifically to high-affinity receptors on both L929 and FS-4 cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated the presence of 2200 binding sites per L929 cell and 7500 binding sites per FS-4 cell. The calculated dissociation constants are 6.1 X 10(-10) M and 3.2 X 10(-10) M for L929 and FS-4 cells, respectively. In both L929 and FS-4 cells, incubation at 37 degrees C resulted in a rapid internalization of the bulk of the cell-bound TNF, followed by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity in the tissue culture medium, due to degradation of TNF. Degradation but not cellular uptake of TNF was inhibited in the presence of chloroquine (an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases) in both L929 and FS-4 cells, suggesting that degradation occurs intracellularly, probably within lysosomes. These results show that resistance of FS-4 cells to TNF cytotoxicity is not due to a lack of receptors or their inability to internalize and degrade TNF.Images	Tumor necrosis factor: specific binding and internalization in sensitive and resistant cells.

We compared the molecular structure of the receptor to human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (HurTNF) on cells of different tissue origin that differ in their response to one of the known activities of TNF. We studied tumor cell lines that respond to the cytotoxic action of TNF and resistant variants that bind TNF, normal cell lines that are stimulated to proliferate by TNF and those that are not affected by TNF, and peripheral blood granulocytes whose activation is also augmented by TNF. Using 125I-labeled HurTNF, we found that it bound mainly to four cellular polypeptides (138, 90, 75, and 54 kDa), three of which were found in every cell type examined and one (138 kDa) that was observed only in a human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) that is highly responsive to the cytotoxic action of TNF. The 138-kDa polypeptide was not found in resistant variants of MCF-7 that bind TNF. In contrast to the other polypeptides, the 138-kDa protein was detected 30 min after incubation at 4 degrees C, as compared to 5 min. Scatchard analysis and cross-linking data suggest a model for the TNF receptor structure whereby the receptor is composed of noncovalently linked membrane-bound polypeptides that bind TNF with high affinity (Kd, 0.05-0.8 X 10(-9) M) with the 138-kDa protein being the least abundant and/or even absent in most cells.Images	A high molecular weight component of the human tumor necrosis factor receptor is associated with cytotoxicity.

We previously reported that granulocytes are able to produce superoxide (O2-), a highly reactive compound formed by the one-electron reduction of oxygen. The demonstration of O2- production was based on the observation that the reduction of extra-cellular cytochrome c by granulocytes was greatly diminished by superoxide dismutase, an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of O2- to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. In the present report, studies concerning the effect of bacteria and serum on O2--dependent cytochrome c reduction by granulocytes are described.In the absence of bacteria, the O2--dependent reduction of extracellular cytochrome c by granulocytes under optimal assay conditions amounted to 9.2±2.8 SD nmol/3 × 106 cells/20 min. When bacteria (100 organisms/cell) were present, the O2--dependent cytochrome c reduction under otherwise similar conditions increased by a factor of nearly four (34.5±9.4). There was no effect of albumin or catalase on cytochrome c reduction, and boiled dismutase had only a small effect. Omission of granulocytes or substitution of live cells by cells by cells killed by heat abolished O2--dependent cytochrome c reduction. Bacteria killed by autoclaving were almost as effective as live bacteria in stimulating granulocyte O2- production. Measurements of particle uptake and O2 uptake by granulocytes indicated that superoxide dismutase did not affect granulocyte metabolism nonspecifically, supporting the conclusion that the diminution of cytochrome c reduction in the presence of dismutase was due to the destruction of O2- by this enzyme.Stimulation of O2- production by bacteria was strongly dependent on the presence of serum in the incubation mixture. Serum heated to 56°C for 45 min was as effective as unheated serum in stimulating O2- production in the presence of bacteria, but boiled serum had no effect. Other experiments suggested that incubation of bacteria with serum resulted in the release of a nonparticulate heat-labile substance capable of stimulating O2- production in the absence of bacteria.Certain characteristics of the O2--dependent cytochrome c reduction by granulocytes were studied, including the dependence of this process on granulocyte, cytochrome c, and bacterial concentrations. In addition, O2--dependent cytochrome c reduction was followed as a function of time. A constant rate was found with resting granulocytes. With bacteria the time course was more complex. A well-defined lag was followed by a fairly brief period of extremely vigorous cytochrome c reduction. During this period, the maximum rate of cytochrome c reduction exceeded the rate observed in the absence of bacteria by a factor of 12. The rate then decreased until by 40 min, it had slowed to the rate observed in the absence of bacteria.From the above results, it was concluded that the exposure of the granulocyte to bacteria plus serum initiates a process in which a defined quantity of O2- is formed in a rapid burst lasting 20-30 min. It is conceivable that the O2- generated by this process may be involved in the killing of bacteria by the granulocytes.Images	Biological Defense Mechanisms THE EFFECT OF BACTERIA AND SERUM ON SUPEROXIDE PRODUCTION BY GRANULOCYTES	John T.

Several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. Bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. The platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. The results support the following conclusions: (1) Bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) Bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) Plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) Collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) Rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) Washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.ImagesFig 1	Platelet Interaction with BacteriaII.

Recent studies indicate that oxygen radicals such as superoxide or singlet oxygen may be important in the functional activity of human granulocytes. We have examined the possible importance of these radicals in the functional capacity of human blood monocytes. Monocytes, like granulocytes, generate chemiluminescence during phagocytosis. Chemiluminescence is impaired 50-90% by superoxide dismutase, an enzyme which enhances the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that superoxide is related to the chemiluminescence generated by monocytes. Superoxide dismutase in a concentration which impaired chemiluminescence also impaired the staphylococcal killing by monocytes. Hexose monophosphate shunt activity and hydrogen peroxide production by granulocytes and monocytes were also evaluated. The oxidation of [1-14C]glucose was used as a measure of hexose monophosphate shunt activity and the oxidation of [14C]formate as an estimation of hydrogen peroxide production. The oxidation of both substrates by monocytes was increased during phagocytosis but, in contrast to results in granulocytes, was not further increased by the addition of superoxide dismutase. These data indicate that superoxide may be important in bactericidal activity of human monocytes. Our results also suggest that the metabolism of oxygen radicals in monocytes and granulocytes may be different.

The capacity of human phagocytes to generate superoxide anion (O2-), a free radical of oxygen, and a possible role for this radical or its derivatives in the killing of phagocytized bacteria were explored using leukocytes from normal individuals and patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Superoxide dismutase, which removes O2-, consistently inhibited phagocytosis-associated nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction indicating the involvement of O2- in this process. Similarly, superoxide dismutase inhibited the luminescence that occurs with phagocytosis, implicating O2- in this phenomenon, perhaps through its spontaneous dismutation into singlet oxygen. Subcellular fractions from homogenates of both normal and CGD leukocytes generated O2- effectively in the presence of NADH as substrate. However, O2- generation by intact cells during phagocytosis was markedly diminished in nine patients with CGD. Leukocytes from mothers determined to be carriers of X-linked recessive CGD by intermediate phagocytic reduction of NBT elaborated O2- to an intermediate extent, further demonstrating the interrelationship between NBT reduction and O2- generation in phagocytizing cells. Activity of superoxide dismutase, the enzyme responsible for protecting the cell from the damaging effects of O2-, was approximately equal in homogenates of normal and CGD granulocytes. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis separated this activity into a minor band that appeared to be the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase associated with mitochondria and a more concentrated, cyanide-sensitive, cytosol form of the enzyme with electrophoretic mobility that corresponded to that of erythrocyte cuprozinc superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the phagocytic killing of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus viridans. A similar inhibitory effect was noted with catalase which removes hydrogen peroxide. Neither enzyme inhibited the ingestion of bacteria. Peroxide and O2- are believed to interact to generate the potent oxidant, hydroxyl radical (.OH). A requirement for .OH in the phagocytic bactericidal event might explain the apparent requirement for both O2- and H2O2 for such activity. In agreement with this possibility, benzoate and mannitol, scavengers of .OH, inhibited phagocytic bactericidal activity. Generation of singlet oxygen from O2- and .OH also might explain these findings. It would seem clear from these and other studies that the granulo cyte elaborates O2- as a concomitant of the respiratory burst that occurs with phagocytosis. To what extent the energy inherent in O2- is translated into microbialdeath through O2- itself, hydrogen peroxide, .OH, singlet oxygen, or some other agent remains to be clearly defined.Images	The role of superoxide anion generation in phagocytic bactericidal activity.

The contribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and one of its unstable intermediates, superoxide anion (O2), to the oxidative reactions that occur in phagocytizing leukocytes was explored by depleting these cells of O2. This was accomplished by allowing them to phagocytize latex particles coated with superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes the generation of H2O2 from O2. Although the rate and extent of phagocytosis of latex coated with bovine serum albumin was similar to latex coated with SOD, the rate of oxygen consumption, [14C]formate oxidation, [1-14C]glucose oxidation, and iodination of zymosan particles was significantly enhanced by SOD. In contrast, the rate and extent of reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) was diminished by 60%. These studies indicate that the majority of NBT reduction by leukocytes is due to O2, whereas stimulation of the hexose monophosphate shunt and iodination of ingested particles requires H2O2 generated from the increased reduction of oxygen by phagocytizing leukocytes.

Human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, when exposed to appropriate stimuli, generate significant amounts of superoxide anion (O-.2), a highly reactive molecule which is possibly involved in bacterial killing. Since the subcellular localization and mechanism of activation of O-.2 generating systems are unknown, we have investigated superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction (attributable to O-.2) by, and lysosomal enzyme release from, normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cells rendered incapable of ingesting particles by treatment with cytochalasin B. Neither phagocytosis nor lysosomal degranulation were prerequisites for enhanced O-.2 generation. Cytochalasin B-treated cells exposed to (a) serum-treated zymosan, a C3b receptor stimulus; (b) heat aggregated human IgG, an Fc receptor stimulus; and (c) the complement component, C5a, generated enhanced amounts of O-.2 in a time and concentration-dependent fashion. These cells also responded by releasing lysosomal enzymes, but there was no correlation between the ability of any immune reactant to provoke enzyme release and its ability to stimulate O-.2 generation. The three stimuli also enhanced O-.2 generation by normal (untreated) polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but only serum-treated zymosan and aggregated IgG were capable of provoking lysosomal enzyme release from normal cells. Untreated zymosan and native IgG neither stimulated O-.2 production nor provoked lysomal enzyme release. Since enhanced O-.2 production was stimulated by immune reactants in the absence of phagocytosis, the O-.2 generating system is very likely associated with the external plasma membrane of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Leukocyte membrane receptors for complement and immunoglobulins may therefore not only serve in particle recognition but also may initiate biochemical events which accompany phagocytosis and killing.

Contact between human neutrophils and aggregated immunoglobulin G bound to micropore filters has been studied as a model of the pathogenesis of tissue damage in immune complex disease. Contact with this surface, as well as with plain filters and polystyrene petri dishes, induced neutrophils to elaborate superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and to generate chemiluminescence, which has been attributed to singlet oxygen. Pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B decreased these activities but increased release of lysosomal beta-glucuronidase, suggesting that degranulation and the burst of oxygen metabolism that characterizes phagocytes are independently regulated functions. Toxic oxygen metabolites released from neutrophils are highly reactive and could mediate tissue injury at sites of inflammation.

Isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes engaged in phagocytosis liberate superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide into the surrounding medium. These two chemical species react to produce the hydroxyl radical, which attacks the leukocyte and leads to premature death of the cell. The hydroxyl radical may be scavenged by mannitol, or its formation can be prevented by the addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase to the medium, thereby eliminating the premature death of the cells. This phenomenon may partially explain the observed anti-inflammatory activity of superoxide dismutase.Images	Free radicals and inflammation.

Addition of arachidonic acid and the divalent cation ionophore A23187 to a suspension of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes led to the formation of (5S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid, (15S)-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-icosatetraenoic acid, and (5S,12R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid. A method based on high-pressure liquid chromatography has been developed for assay of these metabolites. The addition of arachidonic acid to human polymorphonuclear leukocytes always resulted in formation of the isomeric monohydroxy acids. However, cells prepared from blood of different subjects were found to vary with respect to formation of the 5,12-dihydroxy acid. Addition of the ionophore alone strongly stimulated the formation of the 5-monohydroxy acid and more specifically the 5,12-dihydroxy acid from endogenous arachidonic acid. In all experiments performed the formation of the 5-hydroxy acid and the 5,12-dihydroxy acid was maximally stimulated when both arachidonic acid and the ionophore were added to the incubation mixture. Under these conditions, stimulation of 40-fold or more of the formation of both compounds was observed. The data demonstrate that, in addition to causing release of endogenous substrate, the ionophore also activated the enzymatic system involved in the further transformations of arachidonic acid. This finding raises the possibility that this pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism is involved in the biological response (e.g., release of lysosomal enzymes, the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis, and chemotactic factors) of leukocytes to A23187 and other stimuli.

The effects of infusions of bradykinin (0.2 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (0.5 microM) and arachidonic acid (13 microM) on the release of eicosanoids from the guinea-pig isolated perfused lung were investigated using radioimmunoassay for thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha), PGE2, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and LTC4 and bioassay using the superfusion cascade. Bradykinin released more 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha than TXB2, whereas arachidonic acid and ionophore released more TXB2 than 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha. The time course of eicosanoid release varied with the stimulus: bradykinin and arachidonic acid produced an immediate release, whereas the ionophore showed a slower onset of release. Although the amounts of LTB4 and LTC4 released by the ionophore were very low according to radioimmunoassays, there was evidence from the bioassay of release of a leukotriene-like substance, thought to be LTD4. The leukotriene antagonist FPL 55712 lacks specificity in the guinea-pig trachea; at the concentration used (2 microM) it antagonized contractions of the tracheal strip to PGE2 as well as to LTC4. Our results show that in the guinea-pig perfused lung the metabolism of exogenous arachidonic acid is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the metabolism of endogenous arachidonic acid; furthermore, the profile of eicosanoid production is stimulus-dependent.

Spleen cell cultures from young adult mice of a variety of strains were stimulated to incorporate tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) by a goat anti- mouse IgM antiserum and by purified anti-mu antibodies prepared from this serum. This stimulation was shown to depend upon the anti-mu activity of the antiserum. In addition, ultracentrifuged anti-mu and F(ab')2 fragments of anti-mu were shown to be stimulatory. The anti-mu preparation lacked detectable endotoxin contamination and was also shown to stimulate response by two strains (C57BL/10ScCr and C3H/HeJ) which are unresponsive to the mitogenic effects of endotoxin, while it failed to stimulate a response by cells from a mouse strain (CBA/N) which responds to endotoxin. In addition purified goat anti-mouse gamma, kappa antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse kappa-antib odies stimulated uptake of [3H]TdR by mouse spleen cells, although to a lesser degree than the anti-mu preparation.

Murine spleen cells activated by concanavalin A (Con A) in culture produce a class of lymphokine molecules which possess biological activity in a number of lymphocyte response assays. Lymphokines with a mol wt of 30,000, as estimated from gel filtration studies, can be resolved into two components which differ by charge, with isoelectric point (pI) values of 4.3 and 4.9, respectively. Both components stimulate (a) the growth of established T-cell lines in culture, (b) the proliferation of thymocytes in the presence of Con A under culture conditions where Con A alone is nonmitogenic, (c) the induction of antibody responses to heterologous erythrocyte antigens in athymic (nude) spleen cultures, (d) the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in thymocyte cultures, and (e) the generation of CTL in nude spleen cultures. In each of these culture systems we suggest that the assays are detecting a single class of lymphokine which acts directly on activated T cells. Nonactivated T cells must be stimulated by either antigen or mitogen before becoming responsive to lymphokine, but do not require antigen or mitogen for continued growth with lymphokine. The two molecular species, separable by isoelectric focusing are referred to as the T-cell growth factor (TCGF). A lymphokine, similar in size (30,000 daltons) to TCGF but heterogeneous in charge (pI 3.0--4.0), stimulates immune responses to erythrocyte antigens in T-cell-depleted spleen cultures but has no stimulatory activity in the other lymphocyte assay systems described. The data have been interpreted as showing the two molecular forms of murine TCGF (pI 4.3 and 4.9) are responsible for many of the lymphokine activities described elsewhere as thymocyte mitogenic factor, nonspecific T-cell-replacing factor and killer helper factor or costimulator. The other lymphokine, separable from TCGF by charge, appears to have true T-cell-replacing activity.	Biochemical and biological characterization of lymphocyte regulatory molecules. I.

Studies in our laboratory and elsewhere have shown that it is possible to propagate antigen-specific murine T cells in vitro with resultant specific stepwise enrichment of antigen-induced proliferative cells. The proliferative responses of these T cells are antigen specific and dependent upon the presence of antigen-presenting cells (spleen cells) that share the I-A subregion with the proliferating T cell. Using techniques of soft-agar cloning, it has been further possible to isolate clones of antigen-reactive T lymphocytes from such long-term cultures. Data suggesting that these were clones of antigen-reactive T cells were obtained by studying the recognition of antigen in association with antigen-presenting cells with a panel of such clones of antigen-reactive T cells. Proof of clonality was obtained by subcloning. Clones derived from F1-immune mice can be divided into three separate categories: one clone recognizes antigen in association with antigen-presenting determinants of parent A and the F1; the second type recognizes antigen in association with antigen-presenting determinants of parent B and the F1; and the third type recognizes antigen only in association with antigen-presenting determinants of the F1 mouse. Genetic studies on the major histocompatibility complex requirements for antigen presentation to such F1-reactive T cell clones suggests that the hybrid antigen-presenting determinant in this system results from transcomplementation of products of the I-A region of haplotypes a and b. These studies support the concept developed in our laboratory that there exist unique F1 hybrid determinants on (A/J X C57BL/6) F1 cells and suggest that these determinants can be utilized physiologically by hybrid mice in immunocompetent cellular interactions.

"Several laboratories have recently demonstrated that the requirement for macrophages in mitogen-induced production of murine T-cell interleukin 2 (IL-2; formerly referred to as ""T-cell growth factor"") could be circumvented by using the macrophage-derived peptide interleukin 1 (IL-1; formerly referred to as ""lymphocyte-activating factor""). Using two cloned T-cell lymphomas, we investigated the mechanism through which IL-1 exerted its effect on IL-2 production. One of the cell lines used (LBRM-33 5A4) produces large concentrations of IL-2 upon mitogen stimulation, whereas the second (LBRM-33 1A5) is incapable of producing IL-2 in response to mitogen. It was observed that addition of purified IL-1 to nonproducer 1A5 cells converted them to a state in which subsequent mitogen stimulation triggered production of IL-2. The concentration of IL-2 produced by IL-1 treated 1A5 cells was equivalent in magnitude to that generated by mitogen-stimulated 5A4 cells (500-1000 units/ml, or approximately 1000 times the concentration of IL-2 contained in conventional preparations of murine mitogen-conditioned medium). The observations that (i) brief exposure to IL-1 was sufficient for 1A5 cell conversion to IL-2 production and (ii) IL-1 could actively be absorbed from culture medium by live or fixed 1A5 cells led us to propose the existence of IL-1 receptors on responsive 1A5 cells. On the basis of these experiments, we have postulated that IL-1 mediates its effect on immune reactivity (enhancement of thymocyte mitogenesis and induction of antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses) by maturation of a subset of immature T cells to the point where they are capable of IL-2 production. Subsequent release of IL-2 after ligand activation allows for clonal expansion of activated T cells which mediate particular effector functions."

"Cloned murine helper T cells, restricted to the Iab antigens of the major histocompatibility locus and specific for horse erythrocytes as a foreign antigen, produce, in cooperation with antigen and histocompatible adherent cells, soluble factors that replace the helper T cells in their action on B cells. Three types of factors can be distinguished on the basis of molecular weight: proteins having apparent Mr 30,000 (p30) that act antigen- and Ia-nonspecifically as replication- and maturation-inducing factors and proteins having apparent Mr 55,000 (p55) and 125,000 (p125) that act on resting B cells in an Ia-specific, restricted fashion. Neither horse erythrocytes (a T-cell specific antigen) nor p55 and p125, alone or together, stimulate resting B cells to proliferation and maturation. Double occupancy by antigen and p55 or p125, however, renders Ia-compatible, but not Ia-incompatible, resting B cells susceptible to stimulation. The subsequent addition of p30 to these ""excited"" B cells then results in the proliferation and maturation of clones of horse erythrocyte-specific resting B cells, which then replicate under the stimulatory action of p30. p30 do not bind antigen, nor do they bind anti-Ia or anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. p55 are bound by anti-heavy chain variable region antibodies. p55 are bound by anti-heavy chain variable region antibodies, but not by anti-heavy or anti-light chain constant region antibodies or anti-Ia antibodies. p125 molecules bind horse but not sheep erythrocytes and are bound by anti-heavy chain variable region, but not by anti-heavy or light chain constant region or anti-Ia antibodies. p55 and p125 are likely to be soluble analogues of the antigen-specific, Ia-restricted T-cell receptors of the cloned helper T cells."

Culture supernatants of an antigen-stimulated long-term alloreactive T cell line, C.C3.11.75, contain a T-cell-replacing factor (TRF) activity for the B-cell response to antigen. These same supernatants show little activity in the T-cell growth assay or the costimulator assay. TRF activity was assayed by using spleen cells that were rigorously depleted of both T cells and macrophages. In this assay preparations containing interleukin 2 and supernatants from stimulated C.C3.11.75 cells are relatively inactive if added alone but show marked synergy when added together. We conclude that the C.C3.11.75 TRF activity is not due to interleukin 1 or to interleukin 2 but to a third factor provisionally designated as (DL)TRF. This activity may be equivalent to the (late-acting) TRF described by Schimpl and Wecker. Evidence is presented suggesting that the helper activity (DL)TRF is a product of the T-cell line.	Culture supernatants of a stimulated T-cell line have helper activity that acts synergistically with interleukin 2 in the response of B cells to antigen.

A helper factor(s) distinct from interleukin 2 (IL-2) was shown to be present in the concanavalin A-stimulated supernatant of normal mouse spleen cells (normal Con A Sn). Spleen cells thoroughly depleted of T cells required both IL-2 and this factor to produce antibody-secreting cells in response to sheep erythrocytes, although in the presence of IL- 2 and a few T cells the requirement for the factor was less apparent. The factor had an apparent approximately 40,000 mol wt. The factor was found in normal Con A Sn that had been depleted of IL-2 by absorption with IL-2-dependent T cells and was absent from Con A-stimulated supernatants of the IL-2-producing T cell hybridoma, FS6-14.13. These results indicate that multiple helper factors control the B cell response to antigen and that IL-2, in addition to its T cell growth promoting activity, plays a direct role in B cell responses.

A procedure is described for the preparation of long-term lines of normal mouse B lymphocytes. Surface immunoglobulin-bearing splenic B lymphocytes were purified with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and then cultured with lipopolysaccharide for 1-4 wk. The cells were then transferred into medium supplemented with a T-hybridoma-derived supernatant containing interleukin 2 (IL2). Continuous feeding with this supernatant led to the establishment of cell lines that also could be propagated to IL 2-free medium containing interleukin 1 but not in culture medium alone. Cell lines have been propagated in this manner for as long as 10 mo. The cells in these lines have the appearance for small, dense lymphocytes, which all bear surface IgM detectable by immunofluorescence, rosetting, and surface radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. The cells express Ia and lack Thy 1. These cultured B lymphocytes are unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide but can be activated to become more rapidly dividing, immunoglobulin-secreting cells by exposure to culture supernatants containing both T-cell-replacing factor and IL 2.Images	Long-term culture of normal mouse B lymphocytes.

Murine thymus derived (T) lymphocytes primed in vivo to mouse 129 (H- 2bc) derived H-2-negative F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and rechallenged in vitro with X-irradiated F9 stimulator cells differentiated into anti- F9 cell immune cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Using CBA mouse derived splenic responder T cells, F9 stimulator cells triggered a primary cytotoxic anti-F9 response. The CTL generated lysed the F9 antigen- positive target cells F9. PCC3 and PCC4, but not the F9 antigen- negative mouse 129 derived PYS tumor cells, nor LPS induced H-2bc blast cells. Mouse 129 anti-F9 cell antisera but not H-2k anti-H-2bc antisera blocked the lytic interaction with F9 target cells. Similarily unlabeled F9 cells but not H-2bc blast cells inhibited the anti-F9 cell cytotoxicity H-2k anti-F9 cell immune CTL were found to be cytotoxic for syngeneic spermatogonia, known to express the F9 antigen. The results suggest not only that CTL can recognize and lyse H-2-negative target cells, but also that CTL precursors can be sensitized against H- 2-negative stimulator cells. From the data available it may be inferred that anti-F9 Cell immune CTL recognize the F9 antigen, known to be linked with the T/t locus. Since anti-F9 cell immune CTL lyse syngeneic spermatogonia, the system may be useful to analyze in vitro the induction and effector phase of a T-cell-mediated cytotoxic autoimmune orchitis.

A secondary specific cytotoxic response is obtained when lymphocytes primed in vivo to a tumor allograft are exposed to Con A in culture. The secondary cytotoxic cells generated are specific to target cells bearing antigens of the primary sensitizing cells and are qualitatively indistinguishable from the response obtained upon secondary antigenic stimulation. The cell-mediated cytotoxicity is independent of concanavalin A (Con A) and is not affected by the Con A-specific inhibitor, alpha-methyl-D-mannose pyranoside. Furthermore, cultures containing a mixture of submitogenic concentrations of Con A and stimulating antigens showed synergy and augmentation of cytotoxic activity. It is suggested that activation of prekiller cells by Con A into CTL may be mediated via the same or similar receptors normally triggered by the stimulating antigens. Functional similarities between ConA and the lymphocyte-defined antigens of the major histocompatibility complex region are discussed.

Separation of cells by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity was utilized to investigate the physical properties of cytotoxic thymus-derived lymphocytes (CTL) generated in long-term mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC). In kinetic studies, CTL were found almost exclusively in the large cell fractions at the peak of the response on day 4, whereas the majority of CTL in day 14 MLC had the sedimentation properties of small lymphocytes. Reculture until day 14 of cells fractionated on the basis of size on day 4 indicated that the small CTL were derived exclusively from cells which had been large on day 4. Re-exposure of day 14 MLC cells to the original stimulating alloantigens resulted in significant cell proliferation and rapid regeneration of CTL activity. Cell fractionation experiments demonstrated that the cells in the day 14 MLC population which responded to the secondary allogeneic stimulus were small T lymphocytes, and that these cells rapidly developed into large, highly cytotoxic CTL following stimulation. Moreover, by restimulating on day 14 fractions which were selected on the basis of size on day 4, it was found that the responding small lymphocytes were themselves the progeny of cells which were large at the peak of the response. Since CTL and CTL progenitors showed concomitant changes in physical properties with time, the possibility exists that they belong to the same cell lineage, and hence that CTL can differentiate into cells which are no longer cytotoxic, but capable of mounting an anamnestic response.

Lymphocytes stimulated in mixed leukocyte cultures and left for 13-17 days, i.e. beyond their peak proliferative and cytotoxic reactivities, can be restimulated to give a  secondary-type rapid and strong proliferative and cytotoxic response when confronted with cells of the original sensitizing cell donor. We have concerned ourselves primarily with the requirements  of restimulation for the presence of LD and/or SD stimuli on the restimulating cells. (a) The low level cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) associated with LD differences in a primary CML can be restimulated to give a secondary-type response by those same LD antigens. (b) If the original sensitizing cells differ from the responding cells by both LD and SD antigens, restimulation with only the LD antigens, or third-party cells presumably carrying cross- reactive LD antigens, can restimulate the secondary CML responses directed against the SD antigens on the original sensitizing cells. (c) The presence of SD antigens on the restimulating cells that are cross- reactive with the primary sensitizing SD antigens (as determined in a primary CML) leads to the preferential activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive to those antigens although maximum cytotoxicity is still directed at cells carrying the original sensitizing SD antigens. A model to explain these results is presented.	Secondary cell-mediated lympholysis: importance of H-2 LD and SD factors		131173	1976-05-01	4	
On the assumption that the double-coiled pattern of microtubules in the axoneme of Echinosphaerium might be due to links of two sizes between adjacent microtubules, we disassembled microtubules with low temperature and then carefully analyzed the patterns of microtubules that formed upon the addition of heat (22°C) or heat and D2O. Although most of the initial clusters of microtubules that formed could not be interpreted as part of an axoneme, the spacings between these microtubules were the same as that in the axoneme, 70 and 300 A. By model building we were able to show that all clusters that form, including stages in the formation of the axoneme and its 12-fold symmetry, could be explained by links of two sizes (70 and 300 A) and the substructure of the microtubule. We could demonstrate these links with improved staining methods. We suggest that nonaxonemal assemblies of microtubules may be eliminated by the natural selection of the most energetically stable configuration of microtubules, all others undergoing disassembly under equilibrium conditions. Model building further supports this suggestion since the model axoneme possesses more links per tubule than any other cluster found.	STUDIES ON THE MICROTUBULES IN HELIOZOA V.

The axonemes of Raphidiophrys converge near the center of the cell in an electron-opaque material, the centroplast. In order to establish whether this material acts not only to nucleate the microtubules which form the axonemes but also to give the axoneme its characteristic pattern, the microtubules were disassembled with low temperature and stages in their reformation were studied. It was shown that even though the microtubules appear to be nucleated from the centroplast, pattern formation first appeared at a distance from the centroplast. Thus, the axonemal pattern could not be attributed to any prepattern in the centroplast. Rather, the pattern appears to arise by specific interactions between tubules brought about by bridges. It was concluded that each tubule could bind to a maximum of four other tubules and that once one bridge attached to a tubule it specified the binding positions of the others, thus giving the characteristic axonemal pattern of Raphidiophrys.

Colchicine-binding protein, considered to be microtubule protein, was purified from chick embryo brain by column chromatography in one step on DEAE-Sephadex. The active colchicine-binding unit is a dimer, MW 115,000 ± 5000, which is composed of two nonidentical monomeric units. The two subunits are separable by urea-acrylamide gel electrophoresis after they have been reduced and acetylated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the subunits both have molecular weights of 55,000 ± 2000. The amino-acid compositions of the two subunits showed statistically significant differences in six amino-acid residues. These results indicate that colchicine-sensitive cytoplasmic microtubules are heteropolymers.Images	Are Cytoplasmic Microtubules Heteropolymers?	Joseph Bryan, Leslie Wilson	5288762	1971-08-01	4	
"Quantitative ultrastructural analysis and quantitative gel electrophoresis of preparations of selectively solubilized Chlamydomonas outer doublets indicated that tubulins 1 and 2 were present in both the A tubule and the B tubule, and that only tubulin 1 was present in the three protofilaments which form the wall (""partition"") between the lumens of the A and B tubules. The data suggested that the remaining protofilaments of the outer doublet were grouped together in pairs containing the same type of tubulin, pairs containing tubulin 1 alternating with pairs containing tubulin 2. These findings were used to construct models for the arrangement of the two tubulins in the outer doublet. Further analysis by isoelectric focusing resolved tubulins 1 and 2 into at least five bands."	CHLAMYDOMONAS FLAGELLA II. The Distribution of Tubulins 1 and 2 in the Outer Doublet Microtubules	G. B.

"The biosynthesis and maturation of the oligosaccharide moieties of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus were investigated in virus-infected HeLa and BHK21 cells after pulse labeling with [2-3H]mannose. Two major forms of the virus glycoprotein were detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which appear to correspond to the viral glycoprotein with either ""precursor"" or ""mature"" oligosaccharide chains. The precursor chains in both HeLa and BHK21 cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus obtained after a 30-min pulse were large oligomannose structures containing approximately 7--9 mannose residues as estimated by gel filtration analysis. The size of the oligomannose structures initially transferred to the protein may have been even larger. Mature, virus-size oligosaccharide chains, which could be detected after a 20- to 30-min delay, contained only three mannose residues and, in addition, contained branch structures terminating in sialic acid. A precursor--product relationship of these two forms of oligosaccharide chains was demonstrated by pulse--chase labeling of virus-infected HeLa cells. These studies indicated that the large oligomannosyl core structures initially added to the glycoprotein were being ""trimmed"" by the removal of mannose residues prior to (and/or during) the addition of the branch chains terminating in sialic acid.Images"	Oligosaccharide chains are trimmed during synthesis of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus.

Carbohydrate-containing structures in rat liver rough microsomes (RM) were localized and characterized using iodinated lectins of defined specificity. Binding of [125I]Con A increased six- to sevenfold in the presence of low DOC (0.04--0.05%) which opens the vesicles and allows the penetration of the lectins. On the other hand, binding of [125I]WGA and [125I]RCA increased only slightly when the microsomal vesicles were opened by DOC. Sites available in the intact microsomal fraction had an affinity for [125I]Con A 14 times higher than sites for lectin binding which were exposed by the detergent treatment. Lectin-binding sites in RM were also localized electron microscopically with lectins covalently bound to biotin, which, in turn, were visualized after their reaction with ferritin-avidin (F-Av) markers. Using this method, it was demonstrated that in untreated RM samples, binding sites for lectins are not present on the cytoplasmic face of the microsomal vesicles, even after removal of ribosomes by treatment with high salt buffer and puromycin, but are located on smooth membranes which contaminate the rough microsomal fraction. Combining this technique with procedures which render the interior of the microsomal vesicles accessible to lectins and remove luminal proteins, it was found that RM membranes contain binding sites for Con A and for Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) located exclusively on the cisternal face of the membrane. No sites for WGA, RCA, soybean (SBA) and Lotus tetragonobulus (LTA) agglutinins were detected on either the cytoplasmic or the luminal faces of the rough microsomes. These observations demonstrate that: (a) sugar moieties of microsomal glycoproteins are exposed only on the luminal surface of the membranes and (b) microsomal membrane glycoproteins have incomplete carbohydrate chains without the characteristic terminal trisaccharides N-acetylglucosamine comes from galactose comes from sialic acid or fucose present in most glycoproteins secreted by the liver. The orientation and composition of the carbohydrate chains in microsomal glycoproteins indicate that the passage of these glycoproteins through the Golgi apparatus, followed by their return to the endoplasmic reticulum, is not required for their biogenesis and insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane.

Rat liver microsomal glycoproteins were purified by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A Sepharose columns from membrane and content fractions, separated from rough microsomes (RM) treated with low concentrations of deoxycholate (DOC). All periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive glycoproteins of RM showed affinity for concanavalin A Sepharose; even after sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) acrylamide gel electrophoresis, most of the microsomal glycoproteins bound [125I]concanavalin A added to the gels, as detected by autoradiography. Two distinct sets of glycoproteins are present in the membrane and content fractions derived from RM. SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that RM membranes contain 15--20 glycoproteins (15--22% of the total microsomal protein) which range in apparent mol wt from 23,000 to 240,000 daltons. A smaller set of glycoproteins (five to seven polypeptides), with apparent mol wt between 60,000 and 200,000 daltons, was present in the microsomal content fraction. The disposition of the membrane glycoproteins with respect to the membrane plane was determined by selective iodination with the lactoperoxidase (LPO) technique. Intact RM were labeled on their outer face with 131I and, after opening of the vesicles with 0.05% DOC, in both faces with 125I. An analysis of iodination ratios for individual proteins separated electrophoretically showed that in most membrane glycoproteins, tyrosine residues are predominantly exposed on the luminal face of the vesicles, which is the same face on which the carbohydrate moieties are exposed. Several membrane glycoproteins are also exposed on the cytoplasmic surface and therefore have a transmembrane disposition. In this study, ribophorins I and II, two integral membrane proteins (mol wt 65,000 and 63,000) characteristic of RM, were found to be transmembrane glycoproteins. It is suggested that the transmembrane disposition of the ribophorins may be related to their possible role in ribosome binding and in the vectorial transfer of nascent polypeptides into the microsomal lumen.

We studied subcellular localization of saccharide moieties in cultured normal and malignant cells fixed in paraformaldehyde and treated with a nonionic detergent, using lectins specific for various surgar residues as probes in fluorescence microscopy. In normal cells, concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin, specific for mannose-rich carbohydrate cores in glycoproteins, labeled the endoplasmic reticulum as a wide perinuclear region. Other lectins, on the other hand, stained the Golgi apparatus as a juxtanuclear reticular structure. A similar compartmentalization was also seen in all malignant cells studied, although the Golgi apparatus in these cells was distinctly vesicular in appearance. Our results indicate that saccharide moieties in both normal and malignant cells are similarly compartmentalized, and thus speak in favor of a unidirectional subcellular flow for both membrane and secreted glycoconjugates.

To study the site of incorporation of sialic acid residues into glycoproteins in hepatocytes, we gave 40-g rats and 15-g Swiss albino mice a single intravenous injection of [3H]N-acetylmannosamine (8 mCi) and then sacrificed them after 2 and 10 min. To trace the subsequent migration of the labeled glycoproteins, we injected 40-g rats with 4 mCi of [3H]N-acetylmannosamine and sacrificed them after 20 and 30 min, 1, 4, and 24 h, and 3 and 9 d. Concurrent biochemical experiments were carried out to test the specificity of injected [3H]N-acetylmannosamine as a precursor for sialic acid residues of glycoproteins. In radioautographs from rats and mice sacrificed 10 min after injection, grain counts showed that over 69% of the silver grains occurred over the Golgi region. The majority of these grains were localized over the trans face of the Golgi stack, as well as over associated secretory vesicles and possibly GERL. In rats, the proportion of grains over the Golgi region decreased with time to 37% at 1 h, 11% at 4 h, and 6% at 24 h. Meanwhile, the proportion of grains over the plasma membrane increased from 4% at 10 min to 29% at 1 h and over 55% at 4 and 24 h; two-thirds of these grains lay over the sinusoidal membrane, and the remainder were equally divided over the lateral and bile canalicular membranes. Many silver grains also appeared over lysosomes at the 4- and 24-h time intervals, accounting for 15-17% of the total. At 3 and 9 d after injection, light microscope radioautographs revealed a grain distribution similar to that seen at 24 h, with a progressive decrease in the intensity of labeling such that by 9 d only a very light reaction remained. Because our biochemical findings indicated that [3H]N-acetylmannosamine is a fairly specific precursor for the sialic acid residues of glycoproteins (and perhaps glycolipids), the interpretation of these results is that sialic acid is incorporated into these molecules in the Golgi apparatus and that the latter then migrate to secretion products, to the plasma membrane, and to lysosomes in a process of continuous renewal. It is possible that some of the label seen in lysosomes at later time intervals may have been derived from the plasma membrane or from material arising outside the cells.

Complexes of protein-A with 5 and 16 nm colloidal gold particles (PA/Au5 and PA/Au16) are presented as sensitive and clean immunoprobes for ultrathin frozen sections of slightly fixed tissue. The probes are suitable for indirect labeling and offer the opportunity to mark multiple sites. The best procedure for double labeling was to use the smaller probe first, i.e., antibody 1 - PA/Au5 - antibody 2 - PA/Au16. When this was done, no significant interference between PA/Au5 and PA/Au16 occurred. Using this double-labeling procedure we made an accurate comparison between the subcellular distributions of amylase as a typical secretory protein and of GP-2 a glycoprotein, characteristic for zymogen granule membrane (ZGM) preparations. We prepared two rabbit antibodies against GP-2. One antibody (R x ZGM) was obtained by immunizing with native membrane material. The specificity of R x ZGM was achieved by adsorption with the zymogen granule content subfraction. The other, R x GP-2, was raised against the GP-2 band of the SDS polyacrylamide profile of ZGM. We found that the carbohydrate moiety of GP-2 was involved in the antigenic determinant for R x ZGM, while R x GP-2 was most likely directed against GP-2 polypeptide backbone. THe immunocytochemical observations showed that GP-2, on the one hand, exhibited the characteristics of a membrane protein by its occurrence in the cell membrane, the Golgi membranes, and its association with the membranes of the zymogen granules. On the other hand, GP-2 was present in the contents of the zymogen granules and in the acinar and ductal lumina. Also, a GP-2-like glycoprotein was found in the cannulated pancreatic secretion (Scheffer et al., 1980, Eur. J. Cell Biol. 23:122-128). Hence, GP-2 should be considered as a membrane- associated secretory protein of the rat pancreas.

Gold particles in colloidal solutions often vary considerably in size. The finest sols (diameter less than 15 nm), especially, are very heterogeneous, as is indicated by coefficients of variance (CV) of 25- 35%. We have complexed staphylococcal protein A with gold particles (PA/Au) and then fractionated the preparations by glycerol or sucrose gradient centrifugation into very homogeneous subfractions. In this way, PA/Au probes of almost any size between 4.5 and 15 nm could be prepared. The variation of the gold particles in these fractions resulted in CV's between 9 and 16%. The reactivity of the PA/Au complex was not affected by the gradient procedure, as was shown by single- and double-labeling immunocytochemistry of ultrathin cryosections of rat pancreatic tissue.

The distribution of galactosyl transferase was studied using trans and cis Golgi fractions isolated by a modification of the Ehrenreich et al. procedure (1973. J. Cell Biol. 59:45-72) as well as an intact Golgi fraction isolated by a new one-step procedure. Two methods of assay were used. The first method analyzed the ability of Golgi fractions to transfer galactose (from uridine diphosphogalactose [UDP-gal] substrate) to the defined exogenous acceptor ovomucoid. The second method assessed the transfer of galactose from UDP-gal substrate to endogenous acceptors (endogenous glycosylation). The trans Golgi fraction (Golgi light) was highly active by the first method but revealed only low activity by the second method. Golgi fractions enriched in central and cis elements (the Golgi intermediate, heavy and especially the intact Golgi fraction) were highly active in both methods of assay. The endogenous glycosylation approach was validated by gel fluorography of the endogenous acceptors. For all Golgi fractions, transfer of galactose was revealed to secretory glycopeptides. It is concluded that galactosyl transferase activity in vivo occurs primarily in central and cis Golgi elements but not trans Golgi vesicles.

An affinity-purified, monospecific rabbit antibody against soluble human milk galactosyltransferase was used to localize the enzyme in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence and by the protein A-gold technique at the electron microscope level. Specific immunofluorescence was observed in a juxtanuclear cytoplasmic region which was identified, on immunostained thin sections of low-temperature Lowicryl K4M-embedded HeLa cells, as Golgi apparatus. Label by gold particles was limited to two to three trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, indicating a compartmentalization of galactosyltransferase in the cisternal stack. Combination of preembedding thiamine pyrophosphatase cytochemistry, with postembedding immunostaining for galactosyltransferase proved codistribution of the two enzymes. However, the acid phosphatase- positive, trans-most cisterna was negative for galactosyltransferase. The close topological association of both galactosyltransferase and thiamine pyrophosphatase (or nucleoside diphosphatase) suggests a concerted action of both enzymes in glycosylation.

The existence of two separate groups of membrane-enclosed channels in platelets, the open canalicular system (OCS) and the dense tubular system (DTS), has been recognized for several years. The present study has employed ultrastructural observations on normal platelets, cells from a child with the gray platelet syndrome and cytochemical localization of peroxidase in platelets to define the origin of the DTS and point out a specialized membrane complex in platelets formed by interaction of channels from the OCS and DTS. The similarities of membrane complexes in platelets to the organization of membrane systems in muscle is pointed out, and their potential function as the sarcoplasmic reticulum of platelets is discussed.ImagesFig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 1Fig 2	Interaction of Membrane Systems in Blood Platelets	James G.

Interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. Results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) Bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) The platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) The degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) Direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) By adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with Staphylococcus being the most powerful.

The incorporation of large particulates by blood platelets is considered identical to the ingestion of bacteria by neutrophils, and is referred to as platelet phagocytosis. However, bacteria enter neutrophils in sealed vacuoles derived from the cell wall, and products deposited in the vacuoles during neutrophil degranulation are confined almost exclusively to the phagolysosomes. Products released from platelet storage organelles after uptake of foreign particles, on the other hand, are extruded to the cell exterior. The basis for this unusual difference in the phagocytic response of platelets and neutrophils has been sought in the present investigation. Combined electron microscopic and cytechemical study of platelet-latexspherule interaction revealed that platelets do not phagocytize in the usual sense. Most of the latex particles observed in platelets were lodged in channels of the open canalicular system. Channels which contained latex did not pinch off to form sealed phagocytic vacuoles, but remained open. An electron-dense tracer, lanthanum nitrate, was able to penetrate into the channels and outline the ingested latex particles. Therefore, platelets do not phagocytize latex, but sequester the spherules in preformed membranous invaginations. The persistence of open channel communication with the exterior after latex uptake may explain why platelets extrude secretory products, rather than confine them to phagolysosomes.ImagesFig 4Fig 1Fig 5Fig 2Fig 6Fig 3	Uptake of Latex Particles by Blood PlateletsPhagocytosis or Sequestration?

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) the active ingredient of croton oil, is a potent stimulus of irreversible platelet aggregation. The present study has examined the effects of PMA on platelet fine structure during aggregation and after incubation. PMA appears to act primarily on channels of the open canalicular system and intracellular granules. Small amounts of the agent cause dilatation of some open channels and conversion of granules to swollen vacuoles. Platelet discoid shape is not affected significantly by the changes in channels and vacuoles, and aggregation occurs without shape change. EDTA inhibits PMA-induced aggregation but does not prevent the conversion of platelet granules to vacuoles. In unstirred systems PMA causes similar changes in platelet fine structure and spontaneous aggregation. The drug appears to affect the permeability barrier separating granule contents from open channels, thereby leading to osmotic swelling of the storage organelles. PMA is the first agent observed to have a selective influence on the stability of platelet granules.ImagesFig 7Fig 8Fig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6	Ultrastructural Features of the Platelet Response to Phorbol Myristate Acetate	Richard D. Estensen, James G. White	4814896	1974-03-01	4	
Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the active principle of croton oil, is a potent platelet aggregating agent. A previous electron microscopic study indicated that PMA caused selective labilization of platelet granules. The present investigation has employed cytochemical procedures to clarify problems concerning the action of PMA on platelets. Results of this study confirm the suggestion that vacuoles in PMA-treated platelets derive primarily from granules, and demonstrate that the swollen vacuoles are continuous with channels of the open canalicular system (OCS) and surrounding plasma. Despite loss of the barrier separating vacuolated granules from the OCS, the contents of the organelles were not extruded from the PMA aggregated platelets. Stabilization of platelet surface membranes did not inhibit the action of PMA on platelet granules, and examination of replicas of freeze-fractured PMA platelets failed to reveal any specific injury produced by the agent. The findings have elucidated some of the effects of PMA on platelet structure, but have not solved the basic mechanism of drug action.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 7Fig 8	Cytochemical Electron Microscopic Studies of the Action of Phorbol Myristate Acetate on Platelets	James G.

The action of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the active principle of croton oil, on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) has been evaluated in this study. Small amounts of PMA caused the rapid development of vacuoles in neutrophils and the disappearance of specific granules. Histochemical and cytochemical studies revealed that alkaline phosphatase activity was transferred to vacuoles and disappeared from the cells, while myeloperoxidase activity remained associated with intact azurophilic lysosomes. Electron-dense tracers indicated that the vacuole membranes originated, at least in part, from the cell wall of the neutrophils. The results indicate that PMA stimulates events remarkably similar to those which take place when bacteria are engulfed by PMNs, except for the failure of azurophilic lysosomes to participate in PMA-induced vacuole formation. PMA appears to be the first chemical agent capable of inducing selective labilization of specific granules in the neutrophil.ImagesFigs 5 and 6Fig 1Fig 2Figs 7 and 8Fig 9Fig 10Fig 3Fig 4	Selective Labilization of Specific Granules in Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes by Phorbol Myristate Acetate	James G.

Factor VIII-related antigen (VIIIag) is deficient in plasma and platelets of patients with severe von Willebrand's disease. This study reports a second von Willebrand's disease antigen (vWagII), distinct from VIIIag, that is also deficient in the platelets and plasma of patients with severe von Willebrand's disease. VIIIag and vWagII are separable by molecular exclusion chromatography, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. They show reactions of immunologic nonidentity with each other, and thus, do not share a precursor-product relationship. vWagII is released from normal platelets during blood clotting, accounting for a fourfold higher concentration of vWagII in serum over plasma.Images	von Willebrand's disease antigen II.

The mechanism by which ristocetin induces platelet agglutination in the presence of the von Willebrand factor was studied by chemically altering ristocetin and a similar antibiotic, vancomycin, by reaction with a water-soluble carbodiimide in the presence of glycine methyl ester at pH 4.75. Altering ristocetin's phenolic groups (which are thought to be important in its peptide-binding properties) resulted in a loss of both platelet-agglutinating and antibiotic activities. Restoring the phenolic groups with hydroxylamine restored both activities.Vancomycin has antibiotic and peptide-binding properties similar to ristocetin's, but differs structurally in having a free carboxyl group and thus a less positive charge at neutral pH. It does not induce platelet agglutination and actually inhibits ristocetin-induced agglutination. Reacting vancomycin with the water-soluble carbodiimide resulted in alteration of phenolic groups and permanent conversion of the carboxyl to a neutral derivative. Restoring the phenolic groups with hydroxylamine (but leaving the carboxyl neutralized) produced a compound with charge properties similar to ristocetin's which induced platelet agglutination as ristocetin does.These data suggest both a binding requirement (mediated through phenolic groups) and a strong positive charge requirement for ristocetin-induced agglutination. The data are consistent with a model wherein positively charged ristocetin binds, via its phenolic groups, to sites on the platelet surface and reduces the platelet's negative charge. This could reduce the electrostatic repulsion between platelets and/or between platelets and the negatively charged von Willebrand factor, and permit the macromolecular von Willebrand factor to cause agglutination by bridging between platelets.	Studies on the Mechanism of Ristocetin-Induced Platelet AgglutinationEFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION OF RISTOCETIN AND VANCOMYCIN	Barry S. Coller, Harvey R. Gralnick	17620	1977-08-01	4	
Ristocetin will induce the agglutination of platelets in the presence of von Willebrand factor. In previous studies, an electrostatic mechanism was proposed for this phenomenon wherein first the platelet's surface charge is reduced by the binding of ristocetin and then the von Willebrand factor acts as a bridge between platelets. To test this hypothesis, the effects of ristocetin and von Willebrand factor, singly and together, on the electrophoretic mobility of normal, trypsinized, and Bernard-Soulier platelets was measured. Ristocetin alone, at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml or more, produced a statistically significant reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of fresh or fixed platelets. Control experiments showed that the reduction was not due to changes in the ionic milieu of the solution. Therefore, the decrease in platelet mobility is evidence for binding of ristocetin to the platelet surface. Bernard-Soulier and trypsinized platelets also had reductions in mobility with ristocetin, suggesting that ristocetin binds to the platelet at sites other than the binding site for von Willebrand factor. The presence of plasma from a patient with von Willebrand's disease did not alter the reduction in mobility of normal platelets by ristocetin. However, the reduction was markedly enhanced in the presence of normal plasma. This enhancement did not occur with Bernard-Soulier platelets and was inhibited by anti-Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor antiserum or trypsinization of the platelets. Thus, the enhanced reduction appears to be associated with the binding of von Willebrand factor to the platelet surface. These studies indicate that platelets undergo two changes with ristocetin and von Willebrand factor, both of which facilitate agglutination: reduction in net surface charge and binding of von Willebrand factor, a large molecule which can serve as a bridge between platelets. In parallel studies, bovine von Willebrand factor, without ristocetin, agglutinated and reduced the electrophoretic mobility of normal but not Bernard-Soulier or trypsinized platelets; this indicates a similar mechanism of agglutination.

"Normal human fibroblasts contain a cell type-specific glycoprotein antigen (SF) that is known to be slowly shed into the medium and to be present also in human serum.  Immunofluorescence with anti-SF antibodies showed that SF antigen has a highly nonrandom fibrillar distribution in surface of normal fibroblasts.	Simian virus 40- transformed fibroblasts also produced the SF antigen, as shown by radioimmunoassay or immunodiffusion tests, but it was not retained by the surface of these cells.	This creates a major difference between the surfaces of normal and malignant cells."	Fibroblast surface antigen produced but not retained by virus- transformed human cells		167099	1975-08-01	4	
We have isolated the major cell surface glycoprotein of chick embryo fibroblasts, CSP, and added it to a variety of transformed cells in vitro. The transformed cells become more elongated, often more flattened, and show increased adhesion to the substratum. Several transformed cell lines also align in striking parallel arrays. This alignment is characterized by a decrease in the amount of nuclear overlapping, probably indicating restoration of contact inhibition of movement. The morphological changes are antagonized by antibody to CSP. These effects of CSP are not associated with an elevation of cellular 3':5'-cyclic AMP. Moreover, the morphological reversion is not accompanied by an alteration in growth properties. Our results are consistent with a role for CSP in cell adhesion and morphology but not in growth control.Images	Cell surface protein partially restores morphology, adhesiveness, and contact inhibition of movement to transformed fibroblasts.

Fibronectin, a fibroblast surface protein, was purified from human and chicken plasma and extracts of cultured chicken fibroblasts with affinity chromatography on gelatin coupled to Sepharose particles. A fibronectin-like protein was also isolated from the plasma of Torpedo fish. The collagen binding properties of fibronectin were studied with several genetically distinct collagens. Heat denatured types I, II, and III collagens were equal in their binding capacity and more active than the native collagens or A and B chains. Native type III collagen was more active than the other native collagens. Human and chicken fibronectins showed approximately the same pattern of specificity. Identical specificities were shown by the plasma and fibroblast forms of chicken fibronectin. Two cyanogen bromide peptides of the collagen alpha1 (II) chain, CB8 and CB12, derived from different parts of the chain, were active in fibronectin binding. A polymer of the tripeptide pro-gly-pro, and polyproline were inactive. Fibronectin also binds to fibrinogen and fibrin. Comparison of this binding to collagen binding showed that fibrinogen inhibited binding of fibronectin to collagen, but was less active than native collagen. Two other fibrous proteins, tropoelastin and keratin, did not bind fibronectin. The binding of fibronectin to fibrinogen was inhibited by collagen and incorporation of fibronectin into blood clot in the cold was inhibited by gelatin. These results suggest that the binding of fibronectin to collagen and fibrinogen depends on the same binding site in the fibronectin molecule. It is proposed that cell surface fibronectin mediates attachment of cells to the collagenous extracellular matrix and to a temporary fibrin matrix in a wound.

Evidence is presented that fibronectin is present on the platelet cell membrane and that it is a receptor for collagen in the platelet-collagen interaction. First, sodium dodecyl sulfate/acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on the proteins remaining attached to the surface of collagen after the removal of the remainder of the platelet by sonication. The material was relatively enriched in a glycoprotein that comigrated with cold-insoluble globulin (CIG), a form of fibronectin, and in other proteins which comigrated with myosin, actin, and tropomyosin. The presumptive presence of contractile proteins is consistent with the presence of microfibrillar proteins. Second, the collagen-attached material was shown to contain a protein that reacted with anti-CIG serum by immunoelectrophoresis. Third, when CIG was preincubated with fibrous collagen, the platelet-collagen interaction was inhibited. Fourth, rabbit anti-human CIG stimulated human platelets to secrete the contents of their dense granules. The stimulation was not due to antibody complexes present in the solution. Fifth, a protein was extracted from well-washed platelets and purified on affinity columns of anti-CIG antibodies. The isolated protein was found to bind to fibrous collagen.Images	Evidence that fibronectin is the collagen receptor on platelet membranes.

Soluble fibronectin is found in body fluids and media of adherent cultured cells and binds to fibrin and collagen. Insoluble fibronectin is found in tissue stroma and in extracellular matrices of cultured cells. Fibronectin is a substrate for Factor XIIIa (plasma transglutaminase) and can be cross-linked by Factor XIIIa to itself and the the alpha-chain of fibrin. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to investigate Factor XIIIa-mediated crosslinking of fibronectin to collagen. At O degrees or 37 degrees C, fibronectin could be cross-linked to iodinated cyanogen bromide fragment 7 of the alpha 1(I) chain. At 22 degrees or 37 degrees C, fibronectin could be cross-linked to isolated alpha 1(I) chains of type I collagen. Fibronectin could also be crosslinked to types I and III collagen, but only at 37 degrees C. alpha 1(I)-CB7, alpha 1(I) collagen chains, type I collagen, type III collagen, and fibrin all blocked cross-linking between 125I-alpha 1 (I)-CB7 and fibronectin. alpha 1(I)-CB7 blocked cross-linking between fibronectin and fibrin. These results indicate that the determinants of fibronectin-fibrin and fibronectin-collagen binding and cross-linking are similar. Cross-linking of fibronectin to collagen likely occurs in vivo and may be important for normal wound healing, collagen fibrillogenesis, and embryogenesis.Images	Cross-linking of fibronectin to collagen by blood coagulation Factor XIIIa.

The present study has examined the fine structure of freeze-fractured human platelets. Advances in methods used for cell preparation and freezing, together with better instrumentation, have resulted in improved preservation of platelet ultrastructure. Aspects of surface membrane topography and the number, depth of penetration, tortuosity and fenestration of channels belonging to the open canalicular system were revealed in a manner which cannot be fully appreciated in sections of platelets. Elements of the dense tubular system of channels and masses of glycogen were identified in the platelet replicas. The technic may provide an important approach for defining the structural physiology and pathology of blood platelets.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4	The Fine Structure of Freeze-Fractured Blood Platelets	James G.

"The distribution of intramembrane particles of nonactivated and activated human blood platelets was studied by freeze-fracture under various experimental conditions to see whether morphological evidence for a structural coupling between the platelet actomyosin system and the fibrin network in a retracting clot could be established. Membrane particles were evenly distributed in nonactivated platelets; the total number (E + P faces) was approximately 1,500/micrometers 2 of membrane, and there were two to three times more particles present on the E face than on the P face. Transformation of discoid platelets to ""spiny spheres"" by cooling did not change the particle distribution. Platelet activation and aggregation by serum or ADP caused no change in membrane particle density or distribution. Particle distribution was not changed in Ca2+-activated platelets fixed immediately before fibrin formation, but after fibrin formation and during clot retraction, particles were sometimes most frequent on the P face and tended to form distinct clusters, and aggregates of E face pits were observed. Blood platelets contain contractile proteins that are distinct as filaments in platelets in retracting clots. We suggest that the redistribution of particles seen in activated platelets during clot retraction reflects the esablishment of mechanical transmembrane links between the platelet actomyosin system and the fibrin net. The P-face particle clusters may represent sites of force transmission between actin filaments bonded to the inside of the membrane and the fibrin network at the outside. Thus, whereas membrane particles may not be directly involved in the attachment of actin filaments to membranes, the transmission of the force of the contractile system to an exterior substrate apparently involves the intramembrane particles."

1. The growth of the lactoperoxidase-sensitive Streptococcus cremoris 972 in a synthetic medium was inhibited by lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate. The glycolysis and oxygen uptake of suspensions of Strep. cremoris 972 in glucose or lactose were also inhibited. The lactoperoxidase-resistant Strep. cremoris 803 was not inhibited under these conditions but was inhibited in the absence of a source of energy. 2. Lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide completely inhibited the hexokinases of non-metabolizing suspensions of both strains. The inhibition was reversible, hexokinase and glycolytic activities of Strep. cremoris 972 being restored by washing the cells free from inhibitor. The aldolase and 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase activities of Strep. cremoris 972 were partially inhibited but several other enzymes were unaffected. 3. The resistance of Strep. cremoris 803 to inhibition was not due to the lack of hydrogen peroxide formation, to the destruction of peroxide, to the inactivation of lactoperoxidase or to the operation of alternative pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. 4. A `reversal factor', which was partially purified from extracts of Strep. cremoris 803, reversed the inhibition of glycolysis of Strep. cremoris 972. The `reversal factor' also catalysed the oxidation of NADH2 in the presence of an intermediate oxidation product of thiocyanate and was therefore termed the NADH2-oxidizing enzyme. 5. The NADH2-oxidizing enzyme was present in lactoperoxidase-resistant streptococci but was absent from lactoperoxidase-sensitive streptococci.

1. The products of the lactoperoxidase-catalysed oxidation of thiocyanate by hydrogen peroxide were sulphate, carbon dioxide and ammonia. Cyanate, sulphite and a compound showing increased extinction at 235mμ (the `235 compound') were intermediate oxidation products. 2. Two of the intermediates acted as electron acceptors in the oxidation of NADH2. Thus NADH2 was oxidized by sulphite in the presence of lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) and Mn2+ and by the `235 compound' in the presence of an enzyme, the NADH2-oxidizing enzyme, present in extracts of lactoperoxidase-resistant streptococci. Sulphur dicyanide also acted as an electron acceptor in the latter reaction. The `235 compound' was also reduced non-enzymically by sulphite. 3. The glycolysis of lactoperoxidasesensitive streptococci suspended in glucose solution was not inhibited by sulphite, cyanate, cyanide or the `235 compound' but was inhibited by sulphur dicyanide. The inhibition by 0·1mm-sulphur dicyanide could be reversed, as could that caused by lactoperoxidase, thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, by washing the cells or by the addition of a cell-free extract of a lactoperoxidase-resistant streptococcus. 4. The effects of 0·1mm-sulphur dicyanide on catabolic enzymes of resting streptococci were very similar to those of the lactoperoxidase–thiocyanate–hydrogen peroxide system. Thus hexokinase was completedly inhibited, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and aldolase were partially inhibited and phosphohexokinase was little affected in both cases.

The amount of HL-A antigens present on the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a single human donor was increased about 11-fold after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and 36-fold after transformation with Epstein-Barr virus. This increase applied to all four HL-A specificities of these cells. The response to phytohemagglutinin was dependent on dose and was first observed at 12 hr of incubation. Measurements of the amount of surface membranes by geometry, by radioiodinatable surface proteins, and by 5'-nucleotidase (5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.5) assay all indicated that the enhanced representation of HL-A antigens after stimulation by phytohemagglutinin or transformation by Epstein-Barr virus must be due to an increase in the density of these antigens on the cell surface.

The human Bernard-Soulier syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of platelet dysfunction presenting with mild thrombocytopenia, circulating “giant” platelets and a bleeding phenotype. The bleeding in patients with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome is disproportionately more severe than suggested by the reduced platelet count and is explained by a defect in primary hemostasis owing to the absence of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V membrane receptor. However, the molecular basis for the giant platelet phenotype and thrombocytopenia have remained unresolved but assumed to be linked to an absent receptor complex. We have disrupted the gene encoding the α-subunit of mouse GP Ib-IX-V (GP Ibα) and describe a murine model recapitulating the hallmark characteristics of the human Bernard-Soulier syndrome. The results demonstrate a direct link between expression of a GP Ib-IX-V complex and normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet morphogenesis. Moreover, using transgenic technology the murine Bernard-Soulier phenotype was rescued by expression of a human GP Ibα subunit on the surface of circulating mouse platelets. Thus, an in vivo model is defined for analysis of the human GP Ib-IX-V receptor and its role in the processes performed exclusively by megakaryocytes and platelets.

Prostaglandin endoperoxides produced during aggregation of blood platelets are potent promoters of platelet aggregation and the release reaction. The present investigation has studied the effects of prostaglandin endoperoxides produced by platelet microsomes after incubation with arachidonic acid on the ultrastructure of platelets. Prostaglandin endoperoxides caused platelet pseudopod formation and internal transformation associated with a contractile wave within the platelet. The contractile process was similar to that seen following incubation of platelets with collagen or thrombin but was more complete than that seen with 25 muM ADP. Platelet aggregation was more prominent in unstirred samples incubated with the prostaglandin endoperoxides than in samples similarly incubated with 25 muM ADP. Dilatation of the open canalicular system was not a prominent feature except at 45 minutes after addition of the endoperoxides to the platelets, when the platelets appeared to be in a recovery phase. We conclude that the endoperoxides promote platelet stickiness and platelet aggregation by directly or indirectly stimulating the platelet contractile system.ImagesFigure 9Figure 10Figure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 7Figure 8Figure 5Figure 6	The influence of prostaglandin endoperoxides on platelet ultrastructure.

A23187 is an antibiotic ionophore which transports divalent cations across cell membranes into the cytoplasm and releases cations from intracellular storage sites. The present investigation has studied the influence of A23187 on blood platelet aggregation and secretion. A23187 added to stirred C-PRP produced concentration-dependent aggregation and release of 14C-serotonin. Calcium ions potentiated the response of platelets in washed suspensions to A23187, but they were not required for ionophore-induced aggregation or release. N-ethylmaleimide and agents which increase the level of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets were effective inhibitors of A23187-induced aggregation and secretion.Platelets incubated with 45Ca++ before addition of A23187 increased their content of isotope by 50% within 45 seconds after exposure to the ionophore. The results indicate that an increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions from intracellular sources may be the critical event in triggering platelet contraction and the release reaction. Increased concentrations of cAMP may inhibit the platelet response to A23187 and other aggregating agents by stimulating a calcium extrusion pump.	Effects of the Ionophore A23187 on Blood PlateletsI.

Previous studies have shown that abnormalities in collagen-induced platelet aggregation may be due to an impaired release of storage pool ADP, the agent ultimately responsible for platelet aggregation. In some patients and in normal subjects who ingest aspirin, the storage pool of ADP is present in normal amounts, but the mechanism for releasing it appears to be defective (“aspirin-like” defect). In these subjects, the centripetal reorientation of the platelet granules, which may be early structural changes of the release reaction, failed to occur. In one preleukemic patient with an aspirin-like defect, the elements of the open-channel system were also increased. In a second group of patients the impairment of aggregation is due to a deficiency of storage pool ADP. In these patients with storage pool disease, the initial ultrastructural changes associated with the collagen-induced release reaction were normal. The most striking abnormality was a marked decrease in the number of platelet dense bodies. Since the platelets of these patients are deficient in both serotonin and the storage pool of adenine nucleotides, the findings suggest that, in human platelets, these substances are normally stored in the dense bodies. A defect in the formation or function of the dense bodies may account for the abnormalities of platelet aggregation in storage pool disease.ImagesFig 4Fig 5Fig 1Fig 2Fig 6Fig 3	Ultrastructural Findings in Storage Pool Disease and Aspirin-Like Defects of Platelets	Harvey J.

A23187, an ionophore which selectively transports calcium across cell membranes into cytoplasm or releases the divalent cation from intracellular storage sites, was shown in previous studies to stimulate platelet aggregation and the release reaction. The nature of its influence on platelet function suggested that an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration might be a critical factor linking stimulation to secretion through the platelet contractile mechanism. The present investigation has examined the effects of A23187 in platelet ultrastructure and aggregation after incubation with various concentrations of the drug. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed changes in the form and internal organization of platelets following exposure to A23187 that were identical to those which develop in the cells after exposure to potent agents such as collagen and thrombin. High concentrations of ionophore caused destruction of the platelets on prolonged incubation, while the effects of low concentrations on structure and aggregation reversed completely. Recovered platelets were as sensitive to other aggregating agents as control cells. The findings support the concept that platelets are a form of muscle cell and the internal transformation stimulated by A23187 and other aggregating agents is a manifestation of contractile activity. Inactivation of A23187 by plasma followed by recovery of unaltered appearance indicates that platelets have an active mechanism for reducing the level of cytoplasmic calcium.ImagesFig 9Fig 10Figs 3 and 4Figs 5-7Figs 1 and 2p[165]-aFig 8	Effects of the Ionophore A23187 on Blood PlateletsII.

A new antiaggregating chemical, α-(p-(fluoren-9-ylidenemethyl)phenyl)-2-piperidineethanol (RMI 10,393), designated FYPE, was found to be an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, collagen, or epinephrine. Effects of the antiaggregant on platelets were concentration dependent. Aggregation was prevented by low concentrations of FYPE that produced in the platelet only minor ultrastructural changes consisting of loss of microtubules and of discoid shape. Low levels of FYPE that prevented platelet aggregation had no effect on platelet ATPase activities but did alter clot retraction, the thrombin-induced shift in electrophoretic mobility and platelet cholinesterase activity. Market decrease in ADP release and increase in adenyl cyclase activity were produced by low levels of FYPE. This study provides a model for evaluation of platelet antiaggregating compounds in vitro.ImagesFig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 1Fig 2Fig 3	Effect of a New Antiaggregating Chemical on the Structure and Function of the Human Platelet	N.

Lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), an enzyme present in various mammalian glands and in their secretions, catalyses the oxidation of thiocyanate by hydrogen peroxide to form a compound that inhibits the growth, oxygen uptake and acid production of certain bacteria. This compound was found to be too unstable to isolate in pure form, but its properties in dilute aqueous solution were studied with a view to establishing its identity. At thiocyanate concentrations of approximately 1mm, formation of the inhibitor, which took place by a nonstoicheiometric reaction, was maximal when an approximately equimolar amount of hydrogen peroxide was added. Excess of hydrogen peroxide oxidized the inhibitor to sulphate and cyanate. The inhibitor displayed a polarographic reduction wave of which the half-wave potential was pH-dependent. Studies of the variation of the polarographic half-wave potential and of the u.v. extinction with pH indicated that the inhibitor existed in an acid–base equilibrium (pKa 5.1±0.1). The inhibitor decomposed by a mechanism involving H+ ions and thiocyanate, the kinetics varying according to whether the inhibitor was in its acidic or basic form. From these studies it was concluded that the inhibitor was either cyanosulphurous acid (HO2SCN) or cyanosulphuric acid (HO3SCN).	The antibacterial action of lactoperidoxase.

A low-molecular-weight component of complement, similar to or identical with human C5a, interacts with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes treated with cytochalasin B and provokes extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes from these cells. Enzyme release occurs in the absence of particles and is selective in that it is not accompained by release of cytoplasmic enzymes. Cell viability is not altered. Pharmacologic agents that regulate secretion of other inflammatory mediators influenced complement-dependent enzyme release: cAMP and theophylline, prostaglandin E1 and colchicine inhibited, whereas cGMP enhanced release of enzymes. Ultra-structural histochemistry of cells exposed to this component of complement revealed degranulation, fusion of lysosomal with plasma membranes, and transient assembly of microtubules associated with the release of endogenous myeloperoxidase. Our findings suggest that these intracellular events are common to two important responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in inflammation and tissue injury: (a) release of lysosomal hydrolases and (b) chemotaxis.Images	Mechanisms of Lysosomal Enzyme Release from Human Leukocytes: Microtubule Assembly and Membrane Fusion Induced by a Component of Complement	Ira Goldstein, Sylvia Hoffstein, John Gallin, Gerald Weissmann	4355374	1973-10-01	4	
Human neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were studied to determine the influence of cellular locomotion upon the redistribution and capping of concanavalin A (Con A). Con A was detected by fluorescence (using Con A conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate [Con A-FITC]), or on shadow-cast replicas (using Busycon canaliculatum hemocyanin as a marker for Con A). After labeling with Con A 100 µg/ml at 4°C and warming to 37°C, locomotion occurred, and the Con A quickly aggregated into a cap at the trailing end of the cell. When locomotion was inhibited (with cytochalasin B, or by incubation in serum-free medium at 18°C) Con A rapidly formed a cap over the central region of the cell. Iodoacetamide inhibited capping. PMN labeled with FITC, a monovalent ligand, developed caps at the tail only on motile cells; FITC remained dispersed on immobilized cells. PMN exposed to Con A 100 µg/ml at 37°C bound more lectin than at 4°C, became immobilized, and showed slow central capping. The Con A soon became internalized to form a perinuclear ring. Such treatment in the presence of cytochalasin B resulted in the quick formation of persistent central caps. Colchicine (or prior cooling) protected PMN from the immobilizing effect of Con A, and tail caps were found on 30–40% of cells. Immobilization of colchicine-treated cells caused Con A to remain in dispersed clusters. Thus, capping on PMN is a temperature- and energy-dependent process that proceeds independently of cellular locomotion, provided a colchicine-sensitive system is intact and the ligand is capable of cross linking receptors. On the other hand, if the cell does move, it appears that ligands may be swept into a cap at the tail whether cross-linking occurs or not.

Selective release of inflammatory materials from leukocyte lysosomes is reduced by compounds which increase cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in suspensions of human leukocytes and is augmented by agents which increase cyclic 3′,5′-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in these cell suspensions. Lysosomal enzymes are released in the absence of phagocytosis when cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) converts polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to secretory cells: lysosomes merge directly with the plasma membrane upon encounter of PMN with zymosan, and cells selectively extrude substantial proportions of lysosomal, but not cytoplasmic enzymes. β-Adrenergic stimulation of human leukocytes produced a dose-related reduction in β-glucuronidase release (blocked by 10-6 M propranolol) whereas α-adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine plus propranolol) was ineffective. In contrast, the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine chloride enhanced enzyme secretion, an effect blocked by 10-6 M atropine. Incubation of cells with exogenous cAMP or with agents that increase endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E1, histamine, isoproterenol, and cholera enterotoxin) reduced extrusion of lysosomal enzymes; in contrast, exogenous cGMP and carbamylcholine chloride (which increases endogenous cGMP levels), increased β-glucuronidase release. Whereas colchicine (5 × 10-4 M), a drug which impairs microtubule integrity, reduced selective enzyme release, deuterium oxide, which favors microtubule assembly, enhanced selective release of lyosomal enzymes. The data suggest that granule movement and acid hydrolase release from leukocyte lysosomes requires intact microtubules and may be modulated by adrenergic and cholinergic agents which appear to provoke changes in concentrations of cyclic nucleotides.Images	Mechanisms of Lysosomal Enzyme Release from Human Leukocytes II.

Mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC) using spleen cells as responding cells and irradiated allogeneic spleen cells as stimulating cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed by a quantitative 51Cr assay system and the relative frequency of CTL in individual cell populations was estimated from dose-response curves. Inclusion of 2-mercaptoethanol in the MLC medium resulted in a 20–40-fold increase in the relative number of CTL generated at the peak of the response. Under these culture conditions, cell-mediated cytotoxic activity was detectable in MLC populations as early as 48 h after the onset of the cultures. When spleen cells from mice immunized with allogeneic tumor cells 2–4 mo previously were cultured with irradiated spleen cells of the same alloantigenic specificity (MLC-Imm), it was found that the cell-mediated cytotoxic response was detectable earlier and reached higher levels than that observed in a primary MLC. At the peak of the response, MLC-Imm populations were observed to lyse up to 50% of the target cells within 3 h at a lymphocyte: target cell ratio of 0.3:1. Immunological and physical characterization of the effector cells generated in MLC-Imm indicated that they were medium to large-sized T lymphocytes. Altogether, these studies suggested the existence of an anamnestic cell-mediated cytotoxic response in MLC-Imm.	GENERATION OF CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES IN VITRO I.

Cells from CBA fetal mouse liver formed pure or mixed erythroid colonies in semisolid agarculture after stimulation by medium conditioned by pokeweed mitogen-stimulated mouse spleen cells. In general shape, the erythroid colonies resembled typical 7-day single or multiple (burst) colonies. However one-third to one-half contained, in addition to erythroid cells, macrophages and neutrophils and, less commonly, megakaryocytes or eosinophils. Culture of micro manipulated single colony-forming cells showed these erythroid colonies to be clones. Colony-forming cells declined in frequency with advancing fetal age, but low numbers were detectable in adult bone marrow. Assays of spleen conditioned medium in polycythemic mice failed to detect erythropoietin; the cloning system may detect a fetal type of erythropoietin-independent, erythropoietic cell since few were detected in adult marrow.Images	Pure and mixed erythroid colony formation in vitro stimulated by spleen conditioned medium with no detectable erythropoietin.

Separation of platelets from plasma is achieved by adding ADP (final concentration 10-5 M) to platelet-rich plasma and allowing aggregates to form. Aggregates are removed quickly by brief, gentle centrifugation, washed two to three times with 0.9% NaCl (saline), and then incubated for 10 minutes in the presence of apyrase, albumin and calcium. Platelet aggregates deaggregate completely during this incubation period. The platelet suspension is then subjected to 1100g for 12 minutes, gently resuspended in a small volume of saline, and finally diluted with an appropriate medium to the desired concentration. The entire separation procedure requires approximately 30 minutes. Platelets obtained by this procedure are a) comparable in aggregability to the platelet preparations obtained by gel filtration, b) have normal intracellular amounts of ATP and ADP, and c) except for slight dilatation of the surface-connected canalicular system, have normal ultrastructural appearance. When suspended in an appropriate medium, these separated platelets take up serotonin 14-C and subsequently release it in nearly normal quantities when exposed to thrombin, collagen or ADP.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4	Characterization of human platelets separated from blood by ADP-induced aggregation.

The present investigation has evaluated the influence of reserpine on the serotonin-rich organelles bodies) in platelets from dogs, rabbits, and humans. Reserpine markedly depresses the levels of stored serotonin in human and animal platelets, accompanied by a small decrease in platelet ATP but no change in platelet ADP content. Thin sections of human platelets showed no change in the number or morphology of serotonin storage organelles during reserpine therapy, whereas a profound decrease in the size and number of dense bodies occurred in platelets from rabbits treated with reserpine. Dog platelets also showed a decrease in the number and density of serotonin storage organelles after reserpine therapy. The basis for the difference between rabbit and human platelets was explored by fixing platelets in glutaraldehyde and osmium in the presence or absence of the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Most of the dense bodies in fixed human platelets were removed by EDTA while rabbit platelet dense bodies remained essentially intact. The results suggested that the opacity of rabbit platelet dense bodies following fixation with glutaraldehyde and osmium relate primarily to their serotonin content, while the electron density of human serotonin storage organelles in fixed cells is due primarily to their calcium content. Further confirmation of this concept came from studies of platelets using the whole mount technique. Rabbit platelet serotonin storage organelles were found to lack the inherent opacity of the human dense bodies, a finding consistent with the lower concentration of calcium in the rabbit organelles.ImagesFigures 1A-DFigure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figures 5 and 6Figure 7Figure 8	The Influence of Reserpine and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA) on Serotonin Storage Organelles of Blood Platelets	Jonathan M.

Platelet production of 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and 8-(1-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl)-9, 12L-dihydroxy-5,10-heptadecadienoic acid (PHD), two metabolites of the prostaglandin cyclic endoperoxides PGG2 and PGH2, was found in this investigation to occur primarily in a platelet microsomal fraction consisting almost exclusively of membranes. To further localize the membrane site of platelet prostaglandin biosynthesis, the present study has used a cytochemical technique employing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as an oxidizable substrate. The reaction product was found to localize in the platelet dense tubular system. Formation of the reaction product was inhibited by aminotriazole. In similar concentrations, aminotriazole inhibited collagen and arachidonic acid aggregation, the second wave of ADP and epinephrine aggregation, but failed to inhibit aggregation by PGG2 and A23187. A study of the mechanism of action of aminotriazole revealed inhibition of formation of HHT and PHD. The results localize platelet prostaglandin biosynthesis to the membranes of the dense tubular system.ImagesFigure 5Figure 6Figures 1-2Figure 3 and 4	Localization of platelet prostaglandin production in the platelet dense tubular system.

Platelet α-granules contain a factor that stimulates the proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells and may play a role in atherogenesis. We have studied the role of arachidonic acid in mediating the release of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from human platelets. PDGF was assayed by stimulating of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of mouse 3T3 cells. Platelet aggregation and the release of platelet factor 4,β-thromboglobulin, and serotonin were also studied. A biphasic response pattern was observed when gel-filtered platelets were incubated with arachidonate over the concentration range 0.01-0.4 mM. At low arachidonate levels (approximately 0.025-0.1 mM), specific concentration-dependent aggregation and release of PDGF and of the other components were observed. This effect was not seen with any of five other fatty acids tested and was suppressed by indomethacin (25 μM). At higher arachidonate concentrations (approximately 0.15-0.35 mM), a concentration-dependent turn-off of both aggregation and release occurred. At these concentrations the platelets remained functional, and no release of lactate dehydrogenase was observed. A similar biphasic pattern of arachidonate-induced aggregation and release was observed with platelet-rich plasma, over a similar range of arachidonate to albumin mole ratios. These studies demonstrate that PDGF and other α-granule constituents can be released from platelets specifically by arachidonate via an indomethacin-sensitive pathway, most probably involving the platelet cyclooxygenase and conversion of arachidonate to prostaglandin metabolities. The mechanisms responsible for the turn-off of the specific arachidonate-mediated responses at higher arachidonate concentrations remain to be defined.

Plasma and cell-derived fibronectin are potent chemoattractants for human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. The chemotactic property of fibronectin resides in a major 140,000-mol wt non-gelatin-binding fragment of the native molecule. Human monocytes and neutrophils do not recognize fibronectin as a chemotactic stimulus. These findings suggest that fibronectin and perhaps certain fragments of fibronectin may function in vivo as a specific chemoattractant for fibroblasts and could, therefore, induce directional migration of fibroblasts to sites of tissue injury, remodeling or morphogenesis.

AU antigen is defined by reactions of sera from patient AU with cell-surface antigens of cultured autologous melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28). Past studies established that no available cell type other than AU melanoma expressed AU antigen. By use of antibody inhibition tests for antigen detection, limited papain digestion of AU melanoma cells was found to result in the solubilization of AU antigen along with beta2-microglobulin (beta 2m) and HLA allogeneic and xenogeneic specificities. Comparable papain treatment of other melanoma and non-melanoma cell lines solubilized beta 2m and HLA, but did not result in the release of antigen with AU reactivity. Maximum yield of AU antigen from AU melanoma cells was obtained after very short (5-15 min) digestion times in contrast to the more prolonged proteolysis required for maximum HLA and beta 2m release. AU antigen was not immunoprecipitated by rabbit antiserum against beta 2m or HLA under conditions leading to partial or complete removal of beta 2m and HLA. At least a proportion of the molecules with AU determinants appear to be glycoproteins, as indicated by specific affinity for Lens culinaris hemagglutinin (LcH). After affinity chromatography on LcH-agarose, the specific activity of AU antigen was increased 50-fold. As determined by gel filtration chromatography, AU antigen has a molecular weight in the range of 20,000-50,000.

Sera of 106 normal adult men were tested for antibodies reacting with cell surface antigens of three established lines of cultured malignant melanoma. Positive reactions with a protein A assay for IgG antibodies were extremely rare (1-2%). The frequency of positive reactions with assays for IgM antibodies was higher: 5-15% in immune adherence assays and 55-82% in anti-C3 mixed hemadsorption assays. After low-titered sera and sera reacting with fetal calf serum components, conventional alloantigens, and widely distributed class 3 antigens were excluded, sera from seven individuals (one with IgG antibody and six with IgM antibodies) were selected for detailed analysis. The serum containing the IgG antibody came from a healthy 65-year-old Caucasian man; titers of antibody in his serum ranged from < 1/10 to 1/40,000 in tests with different melanoma cell lines. This IgG antibody identifies a differentiation antigen of melanocytes, provisionally designated Mel 1, that distinguishes two classes of melanomas: 22 melanoma cell lines typed Mel 1+ and 17 types Mel 1-. Mel 1 is expressed by fetal fibroblasts but not adult fibroblasts and can be found on a proportion of cultured epithelial cancer cell lines (5 out of 23) but not on glioma or B-cell lines. The melanoma antigens detected by the naturally occurring IgM antibodies are serologically unrelated to Mel 1 but, like Mel 1, appear to be differentiation antigens that distinguish subsets of melanoma. These IgM antibodies detect antigens that are identical or closely related to the AH antigen, a melanoma surface antigen that was initially defined by autologous antibody in a patient with melanoma. In view of the immunogenicity of both Mel 1 and the AH antigens in humans and their occurrence on more than 50% of melanomas, it remains to be seen whether antibody to these antigens can be elicited by specific vaccination of seronegative melanoma patients and whether this will have an influence on the clinical course of the disease.

Clinicopathologic evidence suggests that diffuse intimal thickening, a type of arteriosclerosis without manifest lipid deposit, may predispose to later developing atherosclerosis in man. This hypothesis was tested in the following experiments. Injury to coronary arteries of rabbits was induced by immunologic means, and arterial lesions were allowed to heal for many weeks. One group of animals was then sacrificed, and in their coronary arteries were found numerous fibromuscular intimal lesions closely resembling diffuse intimal thickening in man. The remaining rabbits were fed a cholesterol-supplemented diet for 80 days and then sacrificed. Fibromuscular intimal lesions of coronary arteries were found in these rabbits also. However, approximately two-thirds of these lesions were found to contain lipid, and many closely resembled coronary atherosclerosis in man. Further analysis of the data indicates that the atherosclerotic lesions in the rabbits evolved from immunologically induced fibromuscular intimal lesions which later and preferentially accumulated lipid in the presence of hypercholesterolemia. Results of these experiments suggest that in man fibromuscular intimal lesions, and in particular diffuse intimal thickening, acquired earlier in life can later accumulate lipid preferentially and thus redispose to atherosclerosis.ImagesFig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 7Fig 8Fig 9Fig 10Fig 11Fig 12Fig 13Fig 14	Experimental Induction of Atheroarteriosclerosis by the synergy of Allergic Injury to Arteries and Lipid-Rich DietIII.

Rabbits fed a lipid-rich, cholesterol-poor diet and given concomitant injections of foreign protein, over a period as long as 17 months, developed in their coronary arteries both a) proliferative fibromuscular intimal thickening closely resembling the diffuse intimal thickening that commonly occurs in coronary arteries of man, and b) fatty-proliferative fibromuscular intimal thickening that closely resembles coronary atherosclerosis in man. In contrast, rabbits of another group that were concurrently fed the same diet for as long as 22 months without injections of foreign protein developed changes in arteries of their hearts that resemble neither coronary atherosclerosis nor diffuse intimal thickening in man. Fatty-proliferative changes in aortas of the first group of rabbits are strikingly greater and more closely resemble human aortic atherosclerosis than those in the latter group. In the course of the experiments, the average serum cholesterol was not significantly different in the two groups of rabbits. It was approximately 200 to 250 mg%, which is the average serum cholesterol in adult humans in the United States. These experiments support the hypothesis that the synergy of arterial injury, in particular immunologic injury, and a diet rich in lipid can lead to atherosclerosis in man.ImagesFig 24Fig 25Fig 26,27Fig 28Fig 29Fig 30Fig 31Fig 32Fig 33Fig 34Fig 1Fig 2Fig 3Fig 4Fig 5Fig 6Fig 7Fig 35Fig 36Fig 37Fig 38Fig 8Fig 9Fig 10Fig 11Fig 12Fig 13Fig 14Fig 15Fig 16Fig 17Fig 18Fig 19Fig 20Fig 21Fig 22Fig 23	Experimental Induction of Atheroarteriosclerosis by the Synergy of Allergic injury to Arteries and Lipid-Rich DietII.

Chemotaxis assays in modified Boyden chambers were used to detect fibroblast chemoattractants in materials released from early-stage inflammatory cells, namely, mast cells, platelets, and neutrophils. Strong attractant activity was found in substances released from platelets. This activity was accounted for mainly by the platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF), which is released from the platelets and which was active as a chemoattractant at 0.5-1.0 mitogenic units/ml. The mitogenic activity of purified PDGF, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, occurs at a similar concentration range. By varying the gradient of PDGF, we demonstrated that PDGF stimulates chemotaxis rather than random motility. Preincubation of suspensions of fibroblasts in the presence of PDGF decreased the subsequent migration of cells to a gradient of PDGF as well as to a gradient of fibronectin, which is also in attractant for fibroblasts. The chemotactic response of fibroblasts to PDGF was not inhibited by hydroxyurea or azidocytidine but was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that synthesis of RNA and proteins but not of DNA is required for the chemotactic response to occur. Fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and insulin were not chemotactic for human skin fibroblasts, suggesting that the chemoattractant activity of PDGF for fibroblasts is not a general property of growth factors and mitogens. These results suggest that PDGF could have two functions in wound healing: to attract fibroblasts to migrate into the clot and then to induce their proliferation.

The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is shown to be chemotactic for monocytes and neutrophils. Maximum monocyte chemotaxis to PDGF is fully equal to that achieved with C5a and occurs at congruent to 20 ng/ml (congruent to 0.7 nM). Maximum neutrophil chemotaxis is congruent to 60% that achieved with C5A but occurs at congruent to 1 ng/ml (congruent to 32 pM). The chemotactic activity of PDGF is blocked by specific antisera to PDGF and by protamine sulfate, a competitive inhibitor of PDGF binding to cell surfaces. In contrast to PDGF, epidermal growth factor shows no chemotactic activity for inflammatory cells at 0.5-100 ng/ml. The high level of chemotactic activity of PDGF suggests that in addition to its role as a mitogen for smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, PDGF may be involved in attracting inflammatory cells to sites of platelet release.

"The viral (v)-sis oncogene encodes a protein (p28sis) that is structurally homologous to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We have shown that simian sarcoma virus (SSV)-transformed cells containing the v-sis oncogene release a Mr 20,000 substance that is recognized by antisera to synthetic peptide sequences contained in p28sis. Medium conditioned by SSV-transformed cells competes with 125I-labeled PDGF for specific PDGF receptor sites, initiates DNA synthesis, and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor when added to normal cells. When normal cells are co-cultured with SSV-transformed cells, the PDGF receptors of the normal cells are down-regulated by factors released from the transformed cells. Thus, SSV-transformed cells release material that is functionally similar to PDGF. We have used anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to purify PDGF receptors and to detect PDGF-stimulated receptors in normal cells. SSV-transformed cells have no PDGF receptors detectable by these antibodies or by 125I-labeled PDGF binding studies. However, when SSV-transformed cells are exposed to suramin, a compound that blocks binding of PDGF to its receptors, the receptors reappear on the cell surface and within 8 hr are present at the same levels as in control cells. These ""new"" receptor sites can be phosphorylated in response to PDGF. Thus, the absence of PDGF receptors in SSV-transformed cells is due to down-regulation of the receptors by an autocrine mechanism that can be blocked by suramin.Images"	Blockade of autocrine stimulation in simian sarcoma virus-transformed cells reverses down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptors.

Adult rat arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) in primary culture modulate from contractile to synthetic phenotype. This process includes partial loss of myofilaments and formation of an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and a large Golgi complex. It gives the cells the ability to initiate DNA synthesis and actively proliferate when stimulated with serum or isolated growth factors. After a few divisions, growth becomes partly independent of exogenous mitogens and does not cease until multiple cell layers have been formed. Here, it is demonstrated that serum-free conditioned medium from primary cultures of adult rat arterial SMC contains a factor that initiates DNA synthesis in growth-arrested secondary cultures of SMC. The mitogenic activity was neutralized by antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and no mitogenic activity occurred in conditioned medium from cultures pretreated with actinomycin D, excluding release into the medium of PDGF adsorbed to the plastic vessels during the initial culture in serum-containing medium. Exposure of human fibroblasts to samples of the conditioned medium at 4 degrees C inhibited subsequent binding of 125I-labeled PDGF. It was further shown that the SMC of the primary cultures were able to initiate DNA synthesis in a chemically defined medium lacking PDGF and other growth factors. During the early, most active, and partly autonomous growth phase, the SMC had a low binding capacity for 125I-labeled PDGF and responded but little to stimulation with exogenous PDGF. Later on, with increasing cell density and decreasing growth rate, the ability to bind and respond to exogenous PDGF increased. Taken together, the observations suggest that modulation of SMC from contractile to synthetic phenotype is accompanied by production of a PDGF-like protein and autocrine or possibly by mitogen-independent initiation of DNA synthesis. Functionally, this may be important during wound healing and in the development of atherosclerotic lesions.

Smooth muscle cells use fibronectin to bind to type I and type III collagens but bind to type V collagen by a trypsin-resistant intrinsic glycoconjugate. The binding site on type V collagen is located in the alpha A chain. By using collagen-coated filters in a modified Boyden chamber assay for chemotaxis, it was observed that the platelet-derived growth factor was chemotactic for smooth muscle cells but that several other growth factors were inactive. We suggest that the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima of a blood vessel, which leads to the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque, may be the result of a chemotactic migration of cells responsive to the platelet-derived growth factor.

Phorbol esters induce the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells HL-60 and U-937 along the monocytic-macrophage lineage. This process has been associated with the induction of several cellular protooncogenes, including the c-fos and c-fms genes. We now report that phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the HL-60 and U-937 cells results in the induction of the expression of the c-sis platelet-derived growth factor 2 (PDGF-2) protooncogene. sis mRNA transcripts were not detectable in the uninduced cells but were detectable within 12 hr of phorbol ester induction. Concomitantly, the induced cells were shown to synthesize and secrete biologically active PDGF-like proteins, identified in the conditioned medium of the phorbol ester-treated cells by direct immunoprecipitation with PDGF antiserum. Addition of cycloheximide to phorbol ester-treated HL-60 cells superinduced sis mRNA transcripts. c-sis gene transcripts were also detected in freshly isolated human monocytes but not in human granulocytes or in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage. Activation of the c-sis/PDGF-2 gene in human hematopoietic cells during monocytic differentiation may serve in the mediation of physiologic functions of the differentiated cells by means of the secretion of potent PDGF-like mitogen.Images	Induction of c-sis gene expression and synthesis of platelet-derived growth factor in human myeloid leukemia cells during monocytic differentiation.

It is shown here that the myogenic cell line L6J1, primary skeletal myoblasts, and primary adult arterial smooth muscle cells express the gene for the A chain but not the gene for the B chain (c-sis) of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). It is further demonstrated that conditioned media from L6J1 cultures contain material that (i) competes with 125I-labeled PDGF for binding to human fibroblasts, (ii) is specifically precipitated by antibodies against PDGF, and (iii) has a relative molecular mass comparable to that of PDGF and, after reduction, its constituent subunit chains. The secretion of PDGF-receptor-competing activity was at a maximum in exponentially growing cultures but remained at a high level also after the cells had become confluent, stopped dividing, and fused to form multinucleate myotubes. Similarly, it was previously demonstrated that adult rat arterial smooth muscle cells in primary culture produce a mitogenic protein with immunological and structural properties similar to PDGF. In accordance with these findings, it was recently shown that secretion of PDGF-like mitogens by a number of human tumor cell lines correlates with expression of the gene for the A chain rather than the B chain of PDGF. The results suggest that production of homodimers of PDGF A chains may stimulate proliferation of skeletal myoblasts and arterial smooth muscle cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner. This could fulfill important functions during myogenesis in the embryo as well as in tissue repair and atherogenesis in the adult.Images	Rat skeletal myoblasts and arterial smooth muscle cells express the gene for the A chain but not the gene for the B chain (c-sis) of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and produce a PDGF-like protein.

Four principal cell types involved in the pathophysiologic response of the vessel wall--endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocyte/macrophages--secrete platelet-derived growth factor-like (PDGF-like) mitogenic activities. Extensive structural data on these activities exist only for the mitogen produced by platelets, which is a 30-kd dimeric protein composed of structurally related A and B polypeptide chains encoded by different genes. It was previously demonstrated that normal cultured endothelial cells transcribe mRNA encoding the B chain of PDGF from the c-sis gene. Here several new structural features of the mitogen produced by cultured vascular endothelial cells are shown. Hybridization analysis of RNA from normal cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells revealed that they contain three PDGF A chain transcript species. These RNA species comigrated with and appeared to have the same relative abundance as the three RNA species previously identified in RNA from two human tumor cell lines. A chain transcripts were not identified in RNA from a strain of bovine aortic endothelial cells or in human dermal fibroblasts. The A chain transcripts in HUVE had the same relative abundance as the B chain transcripts. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled endothelial conditioned medium with anti-PDGF antiserum revealed a 31-kd species which was split by reduction and alkylation into two species of 16.5 and 17 kd. Thus, endothelial cells secrete a dimeric mitogen antigenically related to PDGF, with a structure identical to previously isolated PDGF A-chain homodimer. These findings are consistent with the possibility that secretion of PDGF by human endothelial cells may be regulated independently of B-chain expression.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2	Cultured human endothelial cells express platelet-derived growth factor A chain.

Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is thought to be an essential aspect of the development of human atherosclerotic lesions. In this study we posed the question, could a growth factor gene be transcriptionally active in atherosclerotic tissue? We found that transcripts from the sis gene, which encodes one of the two chains of platelet-derived growth factor, were present in surgically removed human carotid artery lesions at levels 5-fold greater than the low level of constitutive expression detected in normal artery. This demonstrates that a growth factor could be synthesized endogenously within human atherosclerotic lesions. Although atherosclerotic lesions are composed predominantly of SMC, large numbers of infiltrating macrophages, T cells, and endothelial cells can also be present, raising the possibility that one of these secondary cell types, rather than SMC, could be responsible for the sis transcripts. Human macrophages activated in culture contained 2- to 4-fold more sis RNA, per micrograms of total cellular RNA, than lesions, whereas T cells activated in culture did not contain significant levels. Cultured human endothelial cells expressed sis transcripts at higher levels than macrophages. Since human arterial SMC in culture express receptors for and are mitogenically responsive to platelet-derived growth factor, transcription of the sis gene by cells within lesions, whether these cells are SMC themselves, macrophages, endothelial cells, or another cell type, suggests that an autocrine and/or paracrine proliferative mechanism is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Images	sis (platelet-derived growth factor B chain) gene transcript levels are elevated in human atherosclerotic lesions compared to normal artery.

Recognition that the sis gene codes for a protein homologous with at least one of the two chains of platelet-derived growth factor has made it possible to directly assess transcriptional expression of platelet-derived growth factor both in cultured cells and in tissue obtained in vivo. We have found that a 3.7-kilobase RNA homologous to the sis gene is expressed at moderate levels in cultured human and bovine endothelial cells, at low levels in in vivo endothelium from human umbilical vein, and at very low levels in bovine aortic endothelium in vivo. This RNA migrates at the same rate as the previously reported sis band in the HUT 102 human T-cell lymphoma line. This band is not found in RNA extracted from freshly obtained bovine aortic media or from human foreskin fibroblasts or cultured fetal human aortic smooth muscle cells. Our in vitro results suggest that the sis gene is responsible for at least part of the platelet-derived growth factor-like mitogenic activity secreted by cultured endothelial cells and indicate that the sis gene is readily activated in endothelial cells during the transition from in vivo conditions to in vitro growth as a monolayer on plastic. Expression of the sis gene by endothelium in vivo raises the possibility that platelet-derived growth factor has a role in the development of the vascular system in the young animal and in the maintenance of the normal vascular system in the adult.Images	Expression of the sis gene by endothelial cells in culture and in vivo.

Alveolar macrophages from normal individuals and patients with interstitial lung diseases spontaneously expressed a 4.2-kilobase mRNA complementary to the c-sis gene, a proto-oncogene coding for one of the chains of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Concomitantly, these cells released a mediator with the properties of PDGF, including: chemotactic factor for smooth muscle cells whose activity was resistant to heat and acid, but sensitive to reduction; mitogenic (competence) activity for fibroblasts; ability to compete with PDGF for its receptor; and precipitated by an anti-PDGF antibody. While blood monocytes did not contain c-sis mRNA transcripts, monocytes matured in vitro expressed c-sis, consistent with the concept that expression of c-sis occurs during the differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages. Together with the known actions of PDGF, these observations suggest that the c-sis proto-oncogene and its PDGF product are part of the armamentarium available to the alveolar macrophages for normal lung defense and participation in lung inflammation.Images	Spontaneous expression of the c-sis gene and release of a platelet-derived growth factorlike molecule by human alveolar macrophages.

Three c-sis cDNA clones were obtained from polyadenylated RNA of a human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I transformed cell line. Two clones, designated pSM-1 and pSM-2, have cDNA inserts of 2498 and 2509 base pairs (bp), respectively, excluding the sizes of the guanylate tails, and the polyadenylate tracts. These clones are shorter than the estimated size of the c-sis mRNA of 4200 bp. Both of these clones can transform NIH 3T3 cells. The third clone, designated pSM-3 has a cDNA insert of 1421 bp and lacks transforming activity. The sequence of clone pSM-1 reveals a single long open reading frame (nucleotides 118-840) encoding chain A of platelet-derived growth factor, and two segments with homology to v-sis (nucleotides 182-871 and 1021-1325). Sequence homology is noted in the 3' untranslated region to the corresponding regions of the beta 1 interferon (IFN), human and murine beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), human interleukin 2 (IL2) genes, and tubulin pseudogenes. However, no typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal is present. An alternating (dCdA)n X (dGdT)n sequence is present in the 3' flanking cellular sequences similar to those in the corresponding position of the human proenkephalin gene, in the first intron of the gamma-IFN gene, and the second intron of the beta-NGF gene.Images	Nucleotide sequence of transforming human c-sis cDNA clones with homology to platelet-derived growth factor.

The v-sis transforming gene encodes the woolly monkey homologue of human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) polypeptide 2. After its synthesis on membrane bound polyribosomes, the glycosylated precursor dimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and travels through the Golgi apparatus. At the cell periphery, the precursor is processed to yield a dimer structurally analogous to biologically active PDGF. Small amounts of two incompletely processed forms are detectable in tissue culture fluids of simian sarcoma virus (SSV) transformants. However, the vast majority remains cell associated. Thus, this growth factor-related transforming gene product is not a classical secretory protein. These findings define possible cellular locations where the transforming activity of the sis-PDGF-2 protein may be exerted.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Fig. 5.Fig. 6.Fig. 7.Fig. 8.Fig. 9.Fig. 11.

Earlier studies demonstrated the induction of beta 2-interferon (IFN-beta 2) in human diploid fibroblasts (FS-4 strain) exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These studies suggested that IFN-beta 2 mediates an antiviral effect in TNF-treated cells and exerts a feedback inhibition of the mitogenic effect of TNF. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the antiviral action of TNF can be enhanced by prior exposure of FS-4 cells to trace amounts of IFN-beta 1. IFN-beta 1, at a higher concentration, can directly increase the expression of IFN-beta 2. Exposure of cells to TNF enhanced IFN-beta 2 (but not IFN-beta 1) mRNA expression in response to poly(I).poly(C), an IFN inducer which is also known to stimulate FS-4 cell growth. Platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-1 also led to the increased expression of IFN-beta 2. However, platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-1 could override the antiviral effect of TNF and also that of exogenously added IFN-beta 1. Our data suggest that a complex network of interactions that involves the endogenous production of IFN-beta 2 is triggered by several growth-modulatory cytokines. Cellular homeostasis is likely to represent a balance between the induction of IFN-beta 2 by these cytokines and their ability to override the inhibitory actions of IFN-beta 2.Images	A cytokine network in human diploid fibroblasts: interactions of beta-interferons, tumor necrosis factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukin-1.

A monoclonal antibody (anti-alpha sm-1) recognizing exclusively alpha- smooth muscle actin was selected and characterized after immunization of BALB/c mice with the NH2-terminal synthetic decapeptide of alpha- smooth muscle actin coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-alpha sm- 1 helped in distinguishing smooth muscle cells from fibroblasts in mixed cultures such as rat dermal fibroblasts and chicken embryo fibroblasts. In the aortic media, it recognized a hitherto unknown population of cells negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin and for desmin. In 5-d-old rats, this population is about half of the medial cells and becomes only 8 +/- 5% in 6-wk-old animals. In cultures of rat aortic media SMCs, there is a progressive increase of this cell population together with a progressive decrease in the number of alpha- smooth muscle actin-containing stress fibers per cell. Double immunofluorescent studies carried out with anti-alpha sm-1 and anti- desmin antibodies in several organs revealed a heterogeneity of stromal cells. Desmin-negative, alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells were found in the rat intestinal muscularis mucosae and in the dermis around hair follicles. Moreover, desmin-positive, alpha-smooth muscle actin- negative cells were identified in the intestinal submucosa, rat testis interstitium, and uterine stroma. alpha-Smooth muscle actin was also found in myoepithelial cells of mammary and salivary glands, which are known to express cytokeratins. Finally, alpha-smooth muscle actin is present in stromal cells of mammary carcinomas, previously considered fibroblastic in nature. Thus, anti-alpha sm-1 antibody appears to be a powerful probe in the study of smooth muscle differentiation in normal and pathological conditions.

The rationale for this study was to determine whether in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit any evidence of endothelial injury could be detected prior to or during the early phase of fatty intimal lesion formation. The data presented showed that in the first 12 weeks of feeding a 0.1% cholesterol-rich diet, rabbit aortas were covered with an intact endothelium. Focal areas of increased endothelial cell replication were observed adjacent to the aortic ostia at 12 and 20 weeks. These replicating cells were almost exclusively located at the shoulders of large raised lesions. In a similar fashion, adherent leukocytes were observed adjacent to the aortic ostia, and at later times they were concentrated at the periphery of these intimal lesions. Smooth muscle cell replication, as assessed by autoradiography, was found to be significantly increased only after 20 weeks of feeding the lipid-rich diet. These data suggest that an increased endothelial cell turnover and leukocyte adhesion were the first detectable changes induced by cholesterol feeding and that smooth muscle cell proliferation occurred soon after these events.ImagesFigure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5Figure 7Figure 8	Morphology and cell kinetics of fatty streak lesion formation in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit.

A monoclonal antibody to muscle cell actin isotypes was produced and characterized. Immunocytochemical analysis of methanol-Carnoy's-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue revealed that this antibody, termed HHF35, reacts with skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and myoepithelial cells, but is nonreactive with endothelial, epithelial, neural, or connective tissue cells. When assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, HHF35 reacts with microfilament bundles from various cultured mammalian smooth muscle cells, but does not react with cultured human dermal fibroblasts or various epithelial tumor cell lines. In one-dimensional gel electrophoresis immunoblot experiments this antibody detects a 42-kd polypeptide from tissue extracts of uterus, ileum, aorta, diaphragm, and heart and extract from smooth muscle cells. The antibody also reacts with a comigrating 42-kd band of highly purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin. HHF35 is nonreactive on immunoblots of extracts from all tested nonmuscle cell extracts. Immunoelectrophoresis followed by immunoblotting performed in the presence of urea and reducing agents reveals recognition of the alpha isoelectrophoretic variant of actin from skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle sources and of the gamma variant from smooth muscle sources. Because HHF35 reacts with virtually all muscle cells, it will be useful as a marker for muscle and muscle-derived cells.ImagesFigure 1p55-aFigure 2Figure 3Figure 4	HHF35, a muscle-actin-specific monoclonal antibody.

Complement-stimulated granulocytes adhere to and induce significant 51Cr release from endothelial cells in vitro. Platelets were stimulated to undergo release, and these release products significantly enhanced granulocyte-endothelial cell adherence and granulocyte-induced 51Cr release from endothelial cells. Platelet serotonin appeared to mediate these phenomena because serotonin antagonists blocked both the enhanced endothelial adherence and 51Cr release. In addition, added serotonin mimicked the effect seen with the stimulated platelets upon granulocyte--endothelial cell adherence and cytotoxicity completely. This enhancement appeared to be due to serotonin effects upon both the granulocyte and endothelial cells. These data suggest that a released platelet constituent might modulate in vivo granulocyte-endothelial cell interactions in clinical disorders.

Reactive oxygen species, particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), participate in neutrophil-mediated glomerulonephritis. However, the mechanism of H2O2 neptrotoxicity is unknown. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil cationic enzyme that localizes in glomeruli, can react with H2O2 and halides to form highly reactive products. We tested the hypothesis that the MPO-H2O2-halide system may induce glomerular injury by infusing MPO followed by H2O2 in a chloride-containing solution into the renal artery of rats. Controls received MPO or H2O2 alone. MPO-H2O2-perfused rats developed significant proteinuria, endothelial cell swelling, and epithelial cell foot process effacement, whereas control kidneys were normal. In the presence of free 125I, MPO-H2O2-perfused rats incorporated large amounts of 125I, localized to the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium by autoradiography, into glomeruli. Glomerular iodination was greatly decreased or absent in controls. The MPO-H2O2-halide system causes glomerular injury and may be important in neutrophil-mediated glomerulonephritis.Images	New mechanism for glomerular injury.

Heparin, when added to citrated platelet-rich plasma (PRP), caused potentiation of platelet aggregation and the release reaction induced by the aggregating agents adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, collagen, and epinephrine. At low concentrations (4.7 x 10(-5) M) arachidonic acid failed to cause aggregation of platelets in citrated PRP. However, in the presence of heparin, the same concentration of arachidonic acid caused aggregation. Examination of PRP for the presence of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) by use of a bioassay revealed that heparin also stimulated release of TxA2. This finding indicated that platelets released more TxA2 when they were challenged by low concentrations of arachidonic acid in the presence of heparin than in its absence. Platelets were labeled with 3H-arachidonic acid and 14C-serotonin, and attempts were made to determine whether heparin stimulated the platelet release reaction first with subsequent increased production of TxA2, or alternatively, whether heparin stimulated TxA2 production first with subsequent enhancement of the release reaction. In view of the demonstrated simultaneous release of 14C-serotonin and 3H-arachidonic acid metabolites, it appeared that either release of 14C and 3H occurs concurrently or, even if one of these events is dependent on the other, both events take place in rapid succession. Timed sequential studies revealed that in the presence of arachidonic acid, the addition of heparin hastened the apparently simultaneous release of both 14C and 3H.

Previous reports have described conflicting results concerning the glycoprotein (GP) and protein composition of Bernard-Soulier platelets. In view of this controversy we have analyzed the platelets of four Bernard-Soulier patients using improved single and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis procedures. An absence of staining for carbohydrate of membrane GP Ib was characteristic for the platelets of each patient. Major periodate-Schiff staining bands corresponding to membrane GP IIb, IIIa, and IIIb were clearly detected and their presence was confirmed by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein content of the Bernard-Soulier platelets was increased two- to fourfold. However, analysis of their protein composition using 7-12% acrylamide gradient gels showed normal polypeptide profiles. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed 125I-labeling of the Bernard-Soulier platelet surface proteins was followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. No labeling in the Ib position was detected whereas the other major membrane GP, including Ia and IIa, were normally located. In contrast, GP Ib was clearly detected by periodate-Schiff staining and autoradiography when normal human platelets that had been exhaustively treated with neuraminidase before the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination were analysed. No abnormalities were detected in the GP patterns of membranes isolated from the patients' erythrocytes. Only a severe molecular abnormality or possible deletion of GP Ib could account for this major platelet lesion in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome.Images	Analysis of the glycoprotein and protein composition of Bernard-Soulier platelets by single and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

We have recently reported the isolation of purified platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa and the generation of monospecific antisera to these membrane proteins. Using these monospecific antisera in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system, it is no demonstrated that glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) and glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) form a complex with purified human fibrinogen. The formation of this GPIIb-GPIIIa fibrinogen complex is calcium dependent, fibrinogen specific, saturable, and inhibited by specific amino sugars and amino acids. These observations suggest that the GPIIb-GPIIIa macromolecular complex on the platelet surface acts under the proper physiologic circumstances as the fibrinogen binding site required for normal platelet aggregation.

Previous work from this laboratory has indicated that thrombin's influence on cell growth can be negative as well as positive. Addition of enzyme to actively growing or confluent cultures of human skin fibroblasts produced growth stimulation, whereas cultures receiving thrombin at the time of subculture displayed inhibited DNA synthesis and mitosis. The specific binding of [125I]thrombin to cells under stimulatory and inhibitory conditions has been studied. Fibroblasts receiving enzyme at subculture bound about two times more [125I]thrombin than those processed in the same way several hours later. The apparent dissociation constant for both groups was approximately 1.5 x 10(-8) M. In each case binding was saturable, although cells receiving enzyme at subculture showed a much higher rate of binding. Experiments were conducted in which enzyme was added to cells at various times after subculture. It was found that the ability of these fibroblasts to specifically bind [125I]thrombin decreased progressively over a 2-h period after subculture and then remained constant for at least 24 h. Evidence is also presented indicating that the binding of [125I]thrombin in both experimental groups was inversely dependent upon the culture density. The biological effects of elevated thrombin binding in cells receiving enzyme at subculture were examined. It was found that inhibited DNA synthesis and altered cellular morphology were directly to this parameter. This study suggests that fibroblasts may possess cryptic thrombin receptors that become exposed during subculture or after injury in vivo. These possibilities and the relationship of cell shape to the availability of thrombin receptors are discussed.

Human plasma fibronectin bound to confluent cell layers of cultured human-skin fibroblasts in two distinct pools. Initial binding of fibronectin occurred in a deoxycholate-soluble pool (Pool I). Binding in Pool I was reversible and reached a steady state after 3 h. After longer periods of incubation, fibronectin became bound in a deoxycholate-insoluble pool (Pool II). Binding in Pool II was irreversible and proceeded at a linear rate for 30 h. After 30 h of incubation, a significant proportion of fibronectin bound in Pool II was present as disulfide-bonded multimers. HT1080 cells, a human sarcoma cell line, did not bind fibronectin in either pool. Also, isolated cell matrices prepared by deoxycholate extraction did not bind fibronection. Binding of fibronectin in Pool I of normal fibroblasts occurred via specific, saturable receptors. There were 128,000 binding sites per cell, and KDiss was 3.6 X 10(-8) M. Fluorescence microscopic localization of fibronectin bound in Pool I and Pool II was performed using fluorescein-conjugated fibronectin. Fluorescent staining in Pool I was present in a punctate pattern and in short, fine fibrils. Pool II fluorescence was exclusively in coarse, dense fibrils. These data indicate that plasma fibronectin may become incorporated into the tissue extracellular matrix via specific cell-surface receptors.

Fibrinogen and the cold-insoluble globulin of plasma (CIg) are the main protein components of the heparin-precipitable fraction of normal plasma. The interactions among these proteins and heparin were examined. Heparin formed a cold-precipitable complex with purified CIg or with mixtures of CIg and fibrinogen but not with purified fibrinogen alone. Cryoprecipitation was augmented by addition of Ca++ or by selection of optimal heparin levels; it was reduced or even abolished by raising the ionic strength or pH or both, or by raising the heparin concentration above that for maximum precipitation of CIg. Fibrinogen reduced the threshold for heparin-induced CIg cryoprecipitation and, by coprecipitating with heparin and CIg, increased the amount of precipitate that formed. In contrast to the heparin-precipitable fraction of normal plasma which contained both fibrinogen and CIg, that from a patient with congenital afibrinogenemia contained CIg but lacked fibrinogen. Normal plasma depleted of CIg by immunoabsorption failed to form a heparin-induced cryoprecipitate. Thus, CIg is essential for heparin-induced cryoprecipitation to occur. Fibrinogen, as assessed by chromatographic experiments with heparin-Sepharose columns, had a considerably lower binding affinity for heparin than did CIg, suggesting that it participates in precipitate formation mainly, if not entirely, by virtue of its affinity for CIg. The region of the fibrinogen molecule accounting for its precipitation with CIg appears to be localized in the carboxy-terminal segment of the Aα-chain; fibrinogen subfractions lacking this region failed to augment cryoprecipitation of heparin-CIg mixtures and, even though such species were present in normal plasma, they failed to coprecipitate in the heparin-induced complex.Images	Interactions among Heparin, Cold-Insoluble Globulin, and Fibrinogen in Formation of the Heparin-Precipitable Fraction of Plasma	Nicolas E.

Studies were carried out on the interactions of uncharged latex beads (0.76 micrometer) with baby hamster kidney cells. Binding of beads to the cells occurred if the beads were coated by cold insoluble globulin (CIG) (plasma fibronectin) but not if the beads were coated by bovine albumin. Bovine albumin-coated beads did not bind to the cells even in the presence of excess CIG in the incubation medium. Binding of beads occurred randomly over the entire surfaces of cells in suspension. However, cell receptors for CIG beads were no longer detectable  on the upper surface of cells spread onCIG-coated tissue culture dishes. Binding of CIG beads to cells occurred at all temperatures tested from 4 degrees to 37 degrees C but the rate was lowest at 4 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, binding was accompanied by endocytosis and the beads were found inside vesicles which appeared to be lysosomes. There was also release of radioactivity from radiolabeled CIG beads during incubation with the cells at 37 degrees C. Binding of CIG beads to cells did not require divalent cations. Finally, the cell receptor for CIG beads was lost after cell trypsinization. The data are discussed in terms of current ideas about the basis for cell adhesion.

Approximately one-half of the amino acid sequence (911 amino acid residues out of 1,880 expected) for bovine plasma fibronectin (cold-insoluble globulin) has been determined. Three types of internal homology were identified, showing that a number of partial gene duplications (multiplications) have occurred during the evolution of this protein. Digestion of fibronectin with plasmin results in major fragments with molecular masses of 29, 170, 23, and 6 kilodaltons (kDal). The NH2-terminal 29-kDal fragment consists of 259 residues ordered as five mutually homologous domains (type I homology) with two disulfide bonds in each domain. The 170-kDal fragment shows two to three bands after NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis, indicating heterogeneity. This fragment contains the gelatin binding site and the strong heparin binding site present in fibronectin. Digestion of the 170-kDal fragment with chymotrypsin liberates a 45-kDal fragment that also binds to gelatin. This fragment contains at least one domain of type I homology and two domains of type II homology. Further digestion of the 170-kDal fragment with chymotrypsin results in the formation of a 30-kDal fragment that retains the heparin binding activity. This fragment contains sequences constituting type III homology. The 23-kDal fragment consists of 178 residues having three domains of type I homology. The 6-kDal fragment consists of two identical peptides of 26 residues, and these two peptides are linked to each other by two disulfide bonds that form the interchain bridges. Another one of the peptides for which the sequence was determined links the COOH-terminus of the 29-kDal fragment to the NH2-terminus of the 170-kDal fragment. This and the fact that the COOH-terminal residue of the 6-kDal fragment is a glutamic acid residue order the four plasmin-digestion fragments as 29-, 170-, 23-, and 6-kDal in the intact fibronectin molecule.

Anti-gelatin factor was prepared from guinea-pig and human serum by affinity chromatography on denatured type-I collagen. As shown previously, this component is related to cold-insoluble globulin. It reacted with 125I-labelled denatured collagen, and the reaction could be inhibited by preincubation with unlabelled collagenous components. In the inhibition assay comparable activities were observed for native and denatured type-I, -II, -III and -IV collagens. There was also no difference in reactivity between collagens of different species. The reactive sites in the collagen alpha-chains were located by inhibition assays on distinct CNBr- and collagenase-derived peptides. The results obtained with fragments from alpha1(I)-, alpha2- and alpha1(II)-chains indicate that the most active region is located between positions 643 and 819 of the alpha1-chain. Lower activities were found for other regions of collagen and may indicate that the factor has the potential to interact with several sites in the alpha-chains. The present data agree with observations by Kleinman, McGoodwin & Klebe [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1976) 72, 426-432] on the specificity of a serum factor promoting the attachment of fibroblasts to collagen.

Unlabeled collagenous proteins were quantified as inhibitors of binding of native, soluble, radioiodinated type I collagen to the fibroblast surface. Collagen types IV, V a minor cartilage isotype (1 alpha 2 alpha 3 alpha), and the collagenlike tail of acetylcholinesterase did not inhibit binding. Collagen types II and III behaved as competitive inhibitors of type I binding. Denaturation of native collagenous molecules exposed cryptic inhibitory determinants in the separated constituent alpha chains. Inhibition of binding by unlabeled type I collagen was not changed by enzymatic removal of the telopeptides. Inhibitory determinants were detected in cyanogen bromide-derived peptides from various regions of helical alpha 1 (I) and alpha 1(III) chains. The aminoterminal propeptide of chick pro alpha 1(I) was inhibitory for binding, whereas the carboxyterminal three-chain propeptide fragment of human type I procollagen was not. The data are discussed in terms of the proposal that binding to surface receptors initiates the assembly of periodic collagen fibrils in vivo.

Cells of the neural crest participate in a major class of cell migratory events during embryonic development. From indirect evidence, it has been suggested that fibronectin (FN) might be involved in these events. We have directly tested the role of FN in neural crest cell adhesion and migration using several in vitro model systems. Avian trunk neural crest cells adhered readily to purified plasma FN substrates and to extracellular matrices containing cellular FN. Their adhesion was inhibited by antibodies to a cell-binding fragment of FN. In contrast, these cells did not adhere to glass, type I collagen, or to bovine serum albumin in the absence of FN. Neural crest cell adhesion to laminin (LN) was significantly less than to FN; however, culturing of crest cells under conditions producing an epithelioid phenotype resulted in cells that could bind equally as well to LN as to FN. The migration of neural crest cells appeared to depend on both the substrate and the extent of cell interactions. Cells migrated substantially more rapidly on FN than on LN or type I collagen substrates; if provided a choice between stripes of FN and glass or LN, cells migrated preferentially on the FN. Migration was inhibited by antibodies against the cell-binding region of FN, and the inhibition could be reversed by a subsequent addition of exogenous FN. However, the migration on FN was random and displayed little persistence of direction unless cells were at high densities that permitted frequent contacts. The in vitro rate of migration of cells on FN-containing matrices was 50 microns/h, similar to their migration rates along the narrow regions of FN-containing extracellular matrix in migratory pathways in vivo. These results indicate that FN is important for neural crest cell adhesion and migration and that the high cell densities of neural crest cells in the transient, narrow migratory pathways found in the embryo are necessary for effective directional migration.

The development of the retinotectal projection has been studied by a new experimental approach combining antibodies against the nerve cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and techniques for mapping neuronal pathways using rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) crystals. Anti-NCAM Fab', which specifically inhibits neurite fasciculation, was injected into the eye cup of 4-day-old chicken embryos. After 4-6 days of development, a small RITC crystal was placed on the neural retina to stain selectively axons arising from a localized region. One day later the retina, optic nerve, and tectum were examined and the paths of the fluorescent retinal ganglion cell axons were traced. These studies have led to four observations: (i) The presence of anti-NCAM Fab' causes the axons to form a disordered nerve bundle at the optic fissure. (ii) Disorder produced in the optic nerve persists throughout the optic pathway up to the tectum. (iii) Many of the misrouted fibers growing on or near the tectal surface can at least partially correct their position. (iv) Late axons grow in straight tracks along other fibers and do not correct their position. Together the results suggest that formation of the retinotectal projection involves both reading of positional cues on the tectum by growth cones of early arriving retinal axons and the tracking of growth cones along preexisting fibers that normally belong to neighboring retinal ganglion cells.Images	Fiber-fiber interaction and tectal cues influence the development of the chicken retinotectal projection.

Fibronectin and certain polypeptide regions of this adhesiveglycoprotein mediate cell attachment and spreading on various substrates.We explored the theoretical prediction that this adhesive protein couldbecome a competitive inhibitor of fibronectin-mediated processes if presentin solution at appropriately high concentrations. Fibronectin function wasinhibited by purified plasma fibronectin at 5- 10 mg/ml, by a 75,000-daltoncell-interaction fragment of the protein at 0.5-1 mg/ml, and even by twosynthetic peptides containing a conserved, hydrophilic amino acid sequenceat 0.1-0.5 mg/ml. Inhibition of fibronectin-dependent cell spreading wasdose dependent, noncytotoxic, and reversible. It was competitive in nature,since increased quantities of substrate-adsorbed fibronectin or longerincubation periods decreased the inhibition. A peptide inhibitory forfibronectin-mediated cell spreading also inhibited fibronectin-mediatedattachment of cells to type I collagen, but it did not affect concanavalinA-mediated spreading. These results demonstrate the potential of a celladhesion molecule and its biologically active peptide fragments to act ascompetitive inhibitors, and they suggest that fibronectin may act bybinding to a saturable cell surface receptor.

We have measured the association of platelet surface membrane proteins with Triton X-100 (Triton)-insoluble residues in platelets surface labeled with 125I. In both concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated and resting platelets, this fraction is composed largely of polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 45,000, 200,000, and 250,000 which comigrate with authentic actin, myosin heavy chain, and actin binding protein, respectively, as judged by PAGE in SDS. Less than 10% of the two major 125I-labeled surface glycoproteins, GPiib and GPIII, were associated with the Triton residue in resting platelets. Within 45 s after Con A addition, 80-95% of these two glycoproteins became associated with the Triton residue and the amount of sedimentable actin doubled. No cosedimentation of GPIIb and III with the cytoskeletal protein-containing Triton residue was seen when Con A was added to a Triton extract of resting cells, indicating that the sedimentation of GPIIb and III seen in Con A-stimulated platelets was not due to precipitation of the glycoproteins by Con A after detergent lysis. Treatment of Triton extracts of Con A-stimulated platelets with DNase I (deoxyribonucleate 5'-oligonucleotidido-hydrolase [EC 3.1.4.5]) inhibited the sedimentation of actin and the two surface glycoproteins in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition of cosedimentation was not due to an effect of DNase I on Con A-glycoprotein interactions since these two glycoproteins could be quantitatively recovered by Con A- Sepharose affinity absorption in the presence of DNase I. When the Con A bound to the Triton residue was localized ultrastructurally, it was associated with cell-sized structures containing filamentous material. In intact cells, there was simultaneous immunofluorescent coredistribution of surface-bound Con A and myosin under conditions which induced a redistribution of platelet myosin. These data suggest that Con A can, in the intact platelet, induce physical interactions between certain surface glycoproteins and the internal cytoskeleton.

Human platelets adhere to trimeric Type 1 chick collagen that was covalently linked to plastic slides, providing the basis for a well- defined quantitative assay. The number of platelets that adhere is a function both of platelet concentration and of collagen density on the slides. In contrast with other in vitro assays using collagen that is not covalently linked to the substratum, we found no platelet-platelet aggregation. Adhesion was absolutely dependent on Mg2+, whereas Ca2+ was ineffective. Native trimeric collagen conformation was required for adhesion, since platelets did not bind to slides containing heat- denatured collagen, or isolated alpha 1(1) or or alpha 2(1) chains. Modifications of collagen oligosaccharides had no effect on adhesion. Adhesion was inhibited by cytochalasin D but was not affected by prostaglandin E1, apyrase, acetylsalicylic acid, or theophylline. Because this assay measures platelet-collagen adhesion in the absence of platelet-platelet aggregation, it should facilitate identification of the platelet surface components that directly mediate this adhesion.

We have described a monoclonal antibody that rounds and detaches chick skeletal myoblasts and myotubes from extracellular substrata. The antibody also inhibits the attachment of myogenic cells to a gelatin- coated substratum but has no detectable effect on myoblast fusion. The cellular response to antibody treatment varies with differentiation and cell type. Young myoblasts and myotubes are rapidly rounded and detached by the antibody. Older myotubes require longer incubation times or higher antibody titers for rounding and detachment. Chick embryo fibroblasts, cardiac cells, and neurons are not similarly rounded and remain attached. Since the antibody also detaches cells from embryonic muscle tissue explants, the cell-substratum interaction perturbed by the antibody appears relevant to the in vivo interaction of myogenic cells with their extracellular matrices. Binding studies using iodinated antibody revealed 2-4 x 10(5) sites per myoblast with an apparent Kd in the range of 2-5 x 10(-9) molar. Embryo fibroblasts bind antibody as well and display approximately twice the number of binding sites per cell. The fluorescence distribution of antigen on myoblasts and myotubes is somewhat punctate and particularly bright along the edge of the myotube. The distribution on fibroblasts was also punctate and was particularly bright along the cell periphery and portions of stress fibers. For both cell types the binding was distinctly different than that reported for collagen, fibronectin, and other extracellular molecules. The antigen, as isolated by antibody affinity chromatography, inhibits antibody-induced rounding. SDS PAGE reveals two unique polypeptides migrating in the region of approximately 120 and 160 kilodaltons (kd). The most straightforward mechanism for the antibody-induced rounding and detachment is the perturbation of a membrane molecule involved in adhesion. The hypothesized transmembrane link between extracellular macromolecules and the cytoskeleton provides an obvious candidate.

Seven monoclonal antibodies against mouse B 16 melanoma cells (produced in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice) were selected that blocked the adhesion of melanoma cells to tissue culture dishes. These antibodies were found to be directed against antigens on the surface of mouse B 16 melanoma cells but not on normal mouse cells such as 3T3 fibroblasts. Similarly, the antigens could not be detected in normal mouse tissues (e.g., lung, kidney, liver) but were found in lungs colonized by B 16 melanoma cells. Significantly, three of these antibodies virtually abolished lung colonization of highly invasive B 16 sublines injected into the animals' bloodstream. They exerted their effect both when preabsorbed by the melanoma cell in vitro and when delivered to the animals prior to the tumor cells. It is suggested that monoclonal antibodies might be a promising tool for preventing metastasis.Images	Monoclonal antibodies inhibit the adhesion of mouse B 16 melanoma cells in vitro and block lung metastasis in vivo.

Univalent antibody fragments prepared from a rabbit antiserum raised against whole human platelets completely inhibited adhesion of platelets to immobilized trimeric collagen in a defined, Mg2+- dependent, adhesion assay. An octylglucoside extract of whole platelets completely neutralized this antibody, and all neutralizing activity bound to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin. Further fractionation on concanavalin A gave rise to subfractions that each neutralized only partially at saturation, when tested against antibody concentrations that inhibit 50% of platelet-collagen adhesion. When tested against higher antibody concentrations that completely inhibited adhesion, each subfraction had no detectable neutralizing effect, although the combined subfractions neutralized completely. This and other evidence suggests that more than one platelet entity participates in platelet- collagen adhesion. Although distinct, they appear to play interdependent roles in a single adhesion process.

Guinea pig peritoneal macrophages were demonstrated to bind selectively soluble 125I-fibrin and fibrin/fibrinogen complexes as compared with fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products, and fibrin degradation products. Cellular uptake was considered to be surface receptor binding on the basis of removal of bound 125I-fibrin by trypsin and because uptake occurred in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. 125I-fibrin uptake could be blocked by nonradioactive fibrin but not by IgG or immune complexes. Binding was uneffected by prior treatment with plasmin or trypsin but was calcium dependent. Only limited reversibility of binding could be demonstrated after prolonged incubation. Scatchard plots permitted an estimate of the number of bound molecules. At saturation 6.92 X 10(6) 125I-fibrin molecules were bound per cell. Similar binding of fibrin was noted in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but not lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Soluble fibrin binding may be a host defense mechanism whereby the reticuloendothelial system can remove fibrin from the blood before the development of microthrombi.

The peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs proved to be a rich source of mononuclear cells (34-52%) with fibrinogen or fibrin (Fib) on their surface. The Fib was readily detected on the surface of viable cells in suspension by fluorescence microscopy using antisera to guinea pig fibrinogen. The fluorescent staining occurred either in a speckled distribution, similar to that of cytophilic IgG, or in a distinctive net-like pattern that probably represented fibrin formation on the cell surface. The binding of Fib to the cell surface required calcium, but not magnesium, in the medium and could occur in vitro during incubation in heparinized plasma that contained fibrinogen concentrations comparable to that in normal peritoneal fluid (0.58 mg/ml). Cell surface Fib was more susceptible to plasmin and trypsin digestion than surface cytophilic IgG. By morphologic and physiologic criteria, cells exhibiting surface Fib were chiefly, if not exclusively, macrophages. Granulocytes, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes from lymph node and thymus had no sppreciable Fib. Cells with surface Fib were rarely observed among mononuclear cells prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation of guinea pig and human blood (1.4 and 4.6%, respectively). Pulmonary alveolar macrophages, functionally distinct from peritoneal macrophages, lacked surface Fib (0.8%). Polymerization of Fib on the surface of macrophages might participate in certain cell interactions, such as the adherence of peritoneal macrophages during the antigen- induced macrophage disappearance reactions. The unexpected finding of Fib binding to the surfaces of peritoneal macrophages raises the possibility of a biologically significant interaction between these cells and the clotting system.

Radiolabeled amino acids were incorporated into nondialyzable protein by cultures of endothelial cells derived from calf aorta. Antibody prepared against purified bovine plasma cold-insoluble globulin (CIG) formed a strong precipitin line upon immunodiffusion against 3H-labeled proteins from endothelial cell culture media. This precipitin line formed a line of identity with the precipitin line formed by anti-CIG and purified CIG. Double-antibody immunoprecipitation of 3H-labeled protein showed that 36.3% of the radioactivity was specifically precipitated by the anti-CIG antibody. Gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate indicated that it contained a single protein species whose molecular weight was consistent with that of CIG isolated from plasma. When cultured cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, the endothelial cells stained specifically with anti-CIG antibody. These data indicate that cultured endothelial cells derived from calf aorta synthesize and secrete a protein antigenically similar to CIG.Images	Synthesis of cold-insoluble globulin by cultured calf endothelial cells.

We have examined bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures for the presence of fibronectin, a high molecular weight cell-surface glycoprotein. Sparse cultures contain fibronectin only on dorsal cell surfaces at regions of cell-cell contact, as detected by immunofluorescence. In contrast, when the endothelial cells reached confluence as a highly contact-inhibited monolayer, fibronectin was detected in an extracellular matrix underneath the cell monolayer but not on top of the monolayer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of isolated extracellular matrix revealed that a predominant component of the matrix is a protein of approximately 2.3 X 10(5) molecular weight, which has been identified as fibronectin.Images	Identification, localization, and role of fibronectin in cultured bovine endothelial cells.

Thrombospondin, the major glycoprotein released from alpha-granules of thrombin-stimulated platelets, is a disulfide-bonded trimer of 160 kilodalton subunits and apparently functions as a platelet lectin. Because cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells synthesize and secrete a glycoprotein (GP-160) which is a disulfide-bonded multimer of 160 kdalton subunits, the possibility that GP-160 is thrombospondin was investigated. Tritiated GP-160 could be immunoisolated from [3H]leucine- labeled endothelial cell postculture medium using a rabbit antiserum to human platelet thrombospondin. Thrombospondin and GP-160 comigrated in two different two-dimensional electrophoretic systems. Both proteins are disulfide-bonded trimers of acidic 160-kdalton subunits. A competitive radioimmunoassay for binding of 125I-thrombospondin to the rabbit antibodies indicated that 49 micrograms of thrombospondin antigen per 10(6) confluent endothelial cells accumulated in postculture medium over 24 h. Thus, endothelial cells secrete large amounts of a glycoprotein that is identical or very similar to platelet thrombospondin.

The binding of 125I-von Willebrand factor (125I-vWF) to platelets stimulated by thrombin, ADP, and a combination of ADP + epinephrine (EPI) is specific, saturable, and reversible. Active platelet metabolism and divalent cations are required for binding induced by these stimuli, but not by ristocetin, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms involved in the vWF-platelet interaction. A monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope of membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib had no effect on the binding of 125I-vWF to normal platelets stimulated by thrombin or a combination of ADP + EPI, but completely blocked ristocetin-induced binding. Binding induced by thrombin to GPIb-blocked platelets was specific. Moreover, thrombin-induced binding of 125I-vWF was increased, rather than decreased, in two patients with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome whose platelets lacked GPIb. Conversely, monoclonal antibodies directed against the GPIIb/IIIa complex had no effect on ristocetin-induced binding of 125I-v-WF to normal platelets, but blocked thrombin- and ADP + EPI-induced binding. To exclude effects mediated by the platelet Fc receptor, a monoclonal IgG directed against an epitope present on human B cells and monocytes, but not expressed on resting or stimulated platelets, was used. It did not affect 125I-vWF binding induced by any of the stimuli. These studies show that platelets have more than one binding site for vWF, and that they may be exposed by different stimuli.ImagesFIGURE 1FIGURE 9	Platelets have more than one binding site for von Willebrand factor.

To define better the role of the fibrinogen receptor in platelet physiology and to characterize it biochemically, a murine monoclonal antibody that completely blocks the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet surface was produced by the hybridoma technique with the aid of a functional screening assay. Purified F(ab')2 fragments and/or intact antibody completely blocked aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, or epinephrine and the binding of radiolabeled fibrinogen to platelets induced by ADP. The antibody did not block agglutination of formaldehyde-fixed platelets by ristocetin or shape change induced by either ADP or thrombin. ADP- and epinephrine-induced release of ATP was completely inhibited by the antibody, but inhibition of release induced by collagen and thrombin was dose dependent and partial. The antibody also dramatically inhibited platelet retention in glass-bead columns, platelet adhesion to glass, and clot retraction. Thus, the antibody induced a thrombasthenic-like state. Immunofluorescent studies confirmed the specificity of the antibody for normal platelets and megakaryocytes and suggested that there is a marked decrease in detectable antigen in thrombasthenic platelets. Radiolabeled antibody bound to an average of approximately 40,000 sites on normal platelets but it bound to less than 2,000 sites on the platelets of a patient with thrombasthenia. The antibody immunoprecipitated both glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, and both glycoproteins bound to an affinity column of the antibody. These studies indicate that there is probably a single anatomic site that is crucial to the binding of all fibrinogen molecules and that this site is most likely on the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. It also suggests that the thrombasthenic phenotype can be completely accounted for on the basis of the inhibition of fibrinogen binding to platelets.ImagesFIGURE 2FIGURE 3FIGURE 6	A murine monoclonal antibody that completely blocks the binding of fibrinogen to platelets produces a thrombasthenic-like state in normal platelets and binds to glycoproteins IIb and/or IIIa.

Vascular endothelial cells derived from adult bovine aorta (ABAE) treated with factor Xa and calcium were found to activate prothrombin. In contrast, nonvascular cells (human foreskin fibroblasts, bovine corneal endothelial cells, or human fetal lung cells) had either no or very little effect on prothrombin activation. In the presence of 6 X 10(5) ABAE cells, 20 ng of factor Xa converted 90 micrograms of prothrombin into 80 units of thrombin after 45 min at 37 degrees C. Exogenous factor V was not required for prothrombin activation, but thrombin generation was enhanced 2- to 4-fold by the addition of factor V (500-2,500 ng/ml). Treatment of ABAE cells with anti-bovine factor V IgG markedly inhibited prothrombin activation by factor Xa and calcium. In cells grown in serum-free medium for 3 months, the amount of factor V activity was equivalent to that found in cells grown with serum, which suggests that these cells probably synthesize factor V. Sparse ABAE cells increased prothrombin activation by factor Xa 6-fold compared to activation in confluent cells. Although previous thrombin treatment of ABAE cells did not enhance prothrombin activation, addition of dansyl arginine-4-ethyl piperidine amide markedly inhibited activation of 125I-labeled prothrombin by factor Xa, indicating that thrombin formation is necessary for optimal prothrombin activation. These data indicate that aortic endothelium may provide a physiologically important surface for activation of prothrombin as well as a mechanism for optimal formation of clots at sites of vascular injury.Images	Prothrombin is activated on vascular endothelial cells by factor Xa and calcium.

"The shape distributions of normal and hardened human and rabbit erythrocytes and platelets were obtained for edge-on orientations of a few hundred freely rotating cells from analyses of microphotographs obtained similarly as by Ponder(1930, Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 20:29) by phase-contrast microscopy at 800 X magnification. Major average diameters (d) and thicknesses (t) were estimated for both normal and hardened cells, and were used to calculate an average geometric axis ratio, rp = t/d, which increases to unity as cells become more spherical. Our fixation procedure did not alter these shape parameters: rp was unchanged for erythrocytes, with d and t values similar to those reported by Ponder (1930); platelets had d X t = 3.6 +/- 0.7 mum X 0.9 +/- 0.3 mum and 3.1 +/- 0.4 mum X 0.6 +/- 0.3 mum, respectively, for human and rabbit cells, with rp = 0.26 and 0.20, respectively. Agreement in rp was found with data obtained by a novel rheo-optical method which allows for a direct statistical averaging for large populations (greater than 100 X 10(3) cells). Histograms and linear correlation studies were made of the above three parameters (d,t,rp), as well as volume (V), total surface area are (S), and sphericity index (S.I.) calculated for both ""prolate ellipsoid"" and ""disc with rounded edges"" models. Results indicate very high linear correlations between rp - t, rp - S. I., and d -S, with high correlations for t - V,d -V and S. Data are in agreement with the few reports in the literature determined by other methods, with the best model for platelets appearing to be an oblate spheroid.ImagesFIGURE 1AFIGURE 1BFIGURE 2FIGURE 3"	Geometry of normal mammalian platelets by quantitative microscopic studies.

The hereditary of the human platelet alloantigen, PlA1, has been studied in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The PlA1 content of platelets from three patients, 20 kindred of these patients, including parents and siblings, and 15 unrelated normal individuals was determined using immunologic techniques based on the release of 51Cr from labeled platelets. The amount of membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa in the platelets of these individuals was determined by quantitative crossed immunoelectrophoresis of Triton X-100 soluble proteins using a multispecific rabbit antibody raised against normal platelets. Platelets from the three thrombasthenic patients contained neither detectable GP IIb and GP IIIa nor detectable PlA1 antigen. Platelets from seven kindred with normal amounts of GP IIb and GP IIIa contained PlA1 antigen levels identical to those detected in platelets of normal individuals. Platelets from 13 kindred, including each parent studied, were shown to contain an amount of GP IIb and GP IIIa equivalent to 53% of that amount detected on normal platelets. Platelets from the same individuals expressed amounts of PlA1 antigen that were either 54.0 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- SD) or 28.0 +/- 2.7% of that present on platelets of normal individuals homozygous for the Al allele. The results presented in this report provide evidence that the expression of the thrombasthenic glycoprotein abnormality and the inheritance of PlA1 antigen are controlled by different genes. These results further suggest that lack of expression of the PlA1 antigen on thrombasthenic platelets results from the decrease or absence of the glycoprotein carrier of the PlA1 determinant, previously shown to be GP IIIa.Images	Inheritance of the human platelet alloantigen, PlA1, in type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.

The platelets from three patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome have been analyzed by surface-labeling coupled with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared with normals. As well as the previously described absence or deficiency in glycoprotein (GP) Ib(alpha) it could be shown that GP Ib beta and an additional low molecular weight glycoprotein GP17 were not detectable using carbohydrate-labeling methods or deficient to the same extent as the GPIb alpha subunit. In addition, the thrombin cleavable glycoprotein could not be detected using carbohydrate-labeling methods in two patients and was deficient in a third. This finding was confirmed in a fourth patient by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus, the changes in the membrane of Bernard-Soulier platelets are more complex than previously thought.Images	Characterization of the platelet membrane glycoprotein abnormalities in Bernard-Soulier syndrome and comparison with normal by surface-labeling techniques and high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Human fibrinogen and fibrin monomer were labeled with heme-octapeptide for cytochemical examination of their interaction with rabbit peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Upon short exposure to labeled fibrin monomer in solution with unlabeled fibrinogen, the cells became covered with surface-adsorbed monomer in nonaggregated form and having a characteristic trinodular shape. Within 30 min, the adsorbed monomer became fully internalized by vesicular uptake, with much of it being incorporated into lysosomal bodies. A concomitant loss of adsorptive capacity of the cell surface for uptake of more monomer accompanied the internalization. By contrast, labeled fibrinogen was not adsorbed by the macrophage surface. Some internalization of fibrinogen by passive fluid-phase pinocytosis was evident, but it was not accompanied by loss of absorptive capacity for fibrin monomer. The active uptake of monomer may have depended on binding to the amino terminus that is blocked by fibrinopeptide A in fibrinogen, because addition of synthetic peptide corresponding to the terminal Gly-Pro-Arg segment inhibited both the adsorption and the internalization of monomer.Images	Adsorptive endocytosis of fibrin monomer by macrophages: evidence of a receptor for the amino terminus of the fibrin alpha chain.

Purified populations of human monocytes (greater than 99% monocytic) contain a subpopulation of cells (8-20%) that will surround themselves with a radial array of needles within 15 s after exposure to plasma. The needles are composed of fibrin as demonstrated by gel electrophoresis of isolated needles and by their reaction with a monoclonal antibody, UC45, that is specific for the alpha chain of fibrin. The addition of UC45 antibody to plasma inhibits the formation of the fibrin needles by monocytes, suggesting that the recognized antigen is important for polymerization. In contrast, UC45 binds weakly to conventional plasma fibrin and does not prevent clotting of plasma although the process is prolonged. Thus, the UC45 antigen is more prominently represented or more accessible on monocyte fibrin. At least 1% of the monocytes were able to form fibers at the earliest time that they could be tested. A greater proportion developed this ability between 2 and 6 h in culture. Macrophages from lung, thymus, and breast milk, when incubated for similar periods of time, do not form fibrin needles. However, phagocytes from tonsils were extremely active in this respect. It is speculated that monocytes may be induced to express fibrin as part of their activities in inflammatory lesions.

Purified human monocytes release and metabolize endogenous arachidonic acid (20:4) from phospholipid stores when challenged with particulate inflammatory stimuli or the calcium ionophore A23187. Using radiolabeled cultures, the percentage of total [3H]20:4 released was similar with each type of stimulus. However, the spectrum of 20:4 metabolites differed. With opsonized zymosan (OpZ) or Sephadex beads coated with IgG immune complexes (Ig-beads), the predominant product was thromboxane (25% of the total) together with smaller amounts of other cyclo-oxygenase products and lipoxygenase metabolites. Levels of thromboxane synthesis by monocytes were comparable to those by platelets, as measured by radioimmunoassay. In contrast, exposure to the nonspecific agent A23187 led to mainly lipoxygenase products (70% of the total). Monocytes isolated from mononuclear cell fractions of peripheral blood contain platelets specifically rosetted to their surfaces. These platelet contaminants were removed by sequential incubations of monocytes in serum and EDTA followed by adherence and detachment from tissue culture vessels. The presence of platelets in routinely isolated monocytes presented a major difficulty in the study of human monocyte 20:4 metabolism since platelets also synthesize thromboxane. Loss of 12-HETE synthesis (16-fold reduction relative to 5- HETE) in A23187-stimulated cultures provided a convenient measure of platelet depletion. This together with the response to monocyte- specific stimuli (OpZ and Ig-beads) allowed for the distinction between monocyte and platelet 20:4 metabolism.

We have investigated the relative binding affinity of white blood cells for platelets, during the centrifugation and washing procedures used for separating mononuclear cells from peripheral blood. In wet cell preparations the majority of monocytes (greater than 90%) showed platelet binding, compared to 14% of lymphocytes and 38% of polymorphs. Monocytes also had greater numbers of attached platelets per cell and demonstrated considerable variation in their affinity for platelets. The phenomenon was affected by the calcium concentration of the medium. Our observations are of value for identifying monocytes in wet cell preparations. The technique may also be useful for studying platelet adhesion in vascular disease.ImagesFigure	Platelet binding in mononuclear cell preparations from peripheral blood.	W. R. Williams, F.

The glycoprotein laminin is found exclusively in the basement membranes of adult tissues, not in the mesenchymal stroma. We studied the appearance and distribution of laminin during the early formation of kidney tubules in mouse embryos and in an in vitro transfilter model system. In immunofluorescence using affinity-purified antibodies, the distribution of laminin showed a clear correlation, both spatially and temporally, to the early stages of tubule formation. In vivo, laminin was first detected in a punctate pattern in areas where the pretubular aggregates form; later, it became confined to the basement membranes of the tubules. In experiments in vitro, the nephrogenic mesenchyme was found to form tubules after 12-24 hr of transfilter contact with the inductor. The first laminin spots were found after 12 hr of culture, 24 hr before overt morphogenesis. As the mesenchymal cells began to aggregate and elongate (at 36 hr), laminin was detected in those cells destined to become epithelial, and at 48 hr it was not found in cells remaining in the stroma. In more mature tubules (at 72 hr), laminin was seen as a sharp band in the basement membranes. It is suggested that laminin is involved in the increased cell adhesiveness during the early aggregation of the nephrogenic mesenchyme.Images	Induction of a basement membrane glycoprotein in embryonic kidney: possible role of laminin in morphogenesis.

Laminin, a basement membrane glycoprotein isolated from cultures of mouse endodermal cells and rat yolk sac carcinoma cells, promoted the attachment of liver cells obtained from regenerating mouse liver. Cells from normal mouse liver attached readily to dishes coated with fibronectin but attached poorly to surfaces coated with laminin. Both proteins efficiently promoted the attachment of cells from livers undergoing regeneration. After regeneration, the attachment to laminin returned to the low levels found in animals not subjected to partial hepatectomy but attachment to fibronectin remained high. Immunofluorescent staining of sections of normal liver with antilaminin revealed the presence of laminin in or adjacent to the walls of the bile ducts and blood vessels. After induction of regeneration by partial hepatectomy, increased amounts of laminin appeared in the sinusoidal areas. After carbon tetrachloride poisoning, staining for laminin was especially pronounced in the necrotic and postnecrotic areas around the central veins. This additional expression of laminin was transient. It reached a maximum around 5--6 days after the injury and then gradually disappeared. These findings show that laminin is an adhesive protein. The increase of laminin in regenerating liver and the adhesiveness of cells from such livers to laminin suggest a role for laminin in the maintenance of a proper tissue organization during liver regeneration.Images	Laminin and fibronectin in cell adhesion: enhanced adhesion of cells from regenerating liver to laminin.

Human embryonic skin fibroblasts have been shown to attach and spread on laminin substrates in the absence of protein synthesis and presence of fibronectin-depleted serum and anti-fibronectin antibodies. Rates of attachment and the type of spreading are virtually identical on fibronectin and laminin-coated substrates with the development of microfilament bundles and focal adhesions. Antibodies to laminin, but not fibronectin, will prevent or reverse fibroblast adhesion to laminin, whereas antibodies to fibronectin but not laminin will give similar results on fibronectin-coated substrates. These and other results indicate that fibroblasts possess distinct receptors for laminin and fibronectin which on contact with suitable substrates promote adhesion through interaction with common intermediates. This type of adhesion is compatible with subsequent growth and extracellular matrix production.	Adhesion, growth, and matrix production by fibroblasts on laminin substrates		6681817	1983-01-01	4	
Serum spreading factor is a glycoprotein isolated from human serum that promotes spreading of a variety of cell types on culture dishes. We developed mouse hybridoma lines secreting monoclonal antibody to serum spreading factor that markedly inhibited the rate of serum spreading factor-promoted spreading of both fibroblastic and epithelial cells in culture. Fibronectin-promoted cell spreading was unaffected by monoclonal antibody to serum spreading factor, and the factor appeared to be distinct by several criteria from fibronectin or laminin. Human serum-promoted cell spreading was partially inhibited by monoclonal antibody to serum spreading factor. The antibody recognized primarily two forms of serum spreading factor that migrated in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a manner consistent with molecular weights of 65,000-70,000 and 75,000-78,000. In addition to being found in plasma, serum spreading factor was also found associated with washed human platelets.Images	Characterization of human serum spreading factor with monoclonal antibody.

"Monoclonal antibodies were prepared against a cell attachment-promoting protein, serum spreading factor, which had been partially purified from human serum by chromatography on glass bead columns. The antibodies selected were those that reacted with polypeptides that had cell attachment-promoting activity after sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunochromatography of human plasma on columns containing the monoclonal antibodies followed by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose yielded material that in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis gave polypeptides of molecular mass 65 and 75 kilodaltons. Both polypeptides bound each of three monoclonal antibodies and had cell attachment-promoting activity after transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Immunofluorescent staining of tissues with the monoclonal antibodies revealed a fibrillar pattern that was mostly associated with loose connective tissue and overlapped with fibronectin fibrils. Fetal membrane tissue, which showed strong staining with the antibodies in immunofluorescence, also gave 65- and 75-kilodalton polypeptides with cell attachment-promoting activity after chromatography on columns containing the monoclonal antibodies. One source of the tissue protein may be fibroblastic cells, because cultured human fibroblasts also stained with the monoclonal antibodies. The staining was fibrillar and appeared to be associated with the cell surface extracellular matrix. We propose the name ""vitronectin"" for the various forms of this protein, on the basis of its binding to glass and its adhesive properties.Images"	Serum spreading factor (vitronectin) is present at the cell surface and in tissues.

The synthetic cell attachment-promoting peptides from fibronectin (Pierschbacher, M. D., and E. Ruoslahti, 1984, Nature (Lond.)., 309:30- 33) were found to detach cultured cells from the substratum when added to the culture in a soluble form. Peptides ranging in length from tetrapeptide to heptapeptide and containing the active L-arginyl-glycyl- L-aspartic acid (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence had the detaching activity, whereas a series of different peptides with chemically similar structures had no detectable effect on any of the test cells. The Arg- Gly-Asp-containing peptides caused detachment of various cell lines of different species and histogenetic origin. Studies with defined substrates showed that the active peptides could inhibit the attachment of cells to vitronectin in addition to fibronectin, indicating that vitronectin is recognized by cells through a similar mechanism as fibronectin. The peptides did not inhibit the attachment of cells to collagen. However, cells cultured on collagen-coated plastic for 24-36 h, as well as cells with demonstrable type I or type VI collagen in their matrix, were susceptible to the detaching effect of the peptides. These results indicate that the recognition mechanism(s) by which cells bind to fibronectinand vitronectin plays a major role in the substratum attachment of cells and that collagens may not be directly involved in cell-substratum adhesion. Since vitronectin is abundant in serum, it is probably an important component in mediating the attachment of cultured cells. The independence of the effects of the peptide on the presence of serum and the susceptibility of many different cell types to detachment by the peptide show that the peptides perturb an attachment mechanism that is intrinsic to the cells and fundamentally significant to their adhesion.

Two antisera were raised in goats against material shed by two different mammary epithelial cell lines into serum-free culture medium. These antisera, when added to the medium of intact, growing mouse mammary tumor cells in the absence of complement, cause distinct and dramatic alterations in cell morphology and adhesiveness. One antiserum (anti-SFM I) causes mouse mammary tumor epithelial cells to round and detach from the substratum. Treatment with the other antiserum (anti- SFM II) does not affect cell-substratum interactions, but causes the cells to convert from an epitheloid to a fibroblastic morphology. Statistical analysis of transmission electron micrographs of control and antibody-treated cells indicates that treatment with anti-SFM II is associated with a substantial reduction in the extent of intercellular junctions, particularly desmosomes. To identify the components with which the two antisera interact, nonionic detergent extracts of mouse mammary tumor cells were fractionated, and the ability of various fractions to block the morphological effects of either antiserum was determined. The whole Nonidet P40 (NP40) extract of the epithelial cells blocked the effects of both antisera. After the extract was subjected to ion exchange and lectin affinity chromatography, two separate fractions were obtained. One fraction blocks and anti-SFM I induced rounding and detachment of cells from the substratum. The second fraction blocks the effects of both antisera. The isolation of the former fraction, which has highly restricted number of components, represents a significant first step toward identifying the surface membrane molecule(s) involved in cell-substratum adhesion in epithelial cells.

Proteases have been used as a tool to investigate the role of surface molecules in fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion. Proteolytic digestion of membrane-proteins by pronase (1 mg/ml for 20 min at 37 degrees C) completely inhibited adhesion of baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts on fibronectin-coated plastic dishes. Various degrees of inhibition were also obtained after treatment with proteinase K, chymotrypsin, papain, subtilopeptidase A, and thermolysin. Protein synthesis was required to restore the adhesive properties of pronase-treated cells, showing the protein nature of the molecules involved in adhesion to fibronectin. A peculiar feature of these proteins was their resistance to cleavage by trypsin. After prolonged trypsin treatment (1 mg/ml for 20 min at 37 degrees C), cells adhered and spread on fibronectin-coated dishes, even when protein synthesis was inhibited by 4 microM cycloheximide. Under these conditions only three glycoproteins (gp) of molecular weight 130,000, 120,000, and 80,000 were left on the cell surface. These were precipitated by a rabbit antiserum against BHK cells that also inhibited adhesion of trypsin-treated cells. gp120 and gp80 were left at the cell surface after mild pronase digestion (0.2 mg/ml for 20 min at 37 degrees C), under conditions not affecting adhesion. These data suggest that these glycoproteins may be involved in fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion in some yet unknown way.

Our object was to obtain information about the molecular structures present at cell-substratum and cell-cell contact sites formed by cultured fibroblasts. We have carried out double immunoelectron- microscopic labeling experiments on ultrathin frozen sections cut through such contact sites to determine the absolute and relative dispositions of the three proteins fibronectin, vinculin, and alpha- actinin with respect to these sites. (a) Three types of cell-substratum and cell-cell contact sites familiar from plastic sections could also be discriminated in the frozen sections by morphological criteria alone, i.e., the gap distances between the two surfaces, and the presence of submembranous densities. These types were: (i) focal adhesions (FA); (ii) close contacts (CC); and (iii) extracellular matrix contacts (ECM). This morphological typing of the contact sites allowed us to recognize and assign distinctive immunolabeling patterns for the three proteins to each type of site on the frozen sections. (b) FA sites were immunolabeled intracellularly for vinculin and alpha- actinin, with vinculin labeling situated closer to the membrane than alpha-actinin. Fibronectin was not labeled in the narrow gap between the cell surface and the substratum, or between two cells, at FA sites. Control experiments showed that this could not be ascribed to inaccessibility of the FA narrow gap to the immunolabeling reagents but indicated an absence or severe depletion of fibronectin from these sites. (c) CC sites were labeled intracellularly for alpha-actinin but not vinculin and were labeled extracellularly for fibronectin. (d) ECM sites were characterized by large separations (often greater than 100 nm) between the cell and substratum or between two cells, which were connected by long cables of extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin. In late (24-36 h) cultures, ECM contacts predominated over the other types. ECM sites appeared to be of two kinds, one labeled intracellularly for both alpha-actinin and vinculin, the other for alpha-actinin alone. (e) From these and other results, a coherent but tentative scheme is proposed for the molecular ultrastructure of these contacts sites, and specific functional roles are suggested for fibronectin, vinculin, and alpha-actinin in cell adhesion and in the linkage of intracellular microfilaments to membranes at the different types of contact sites.

Neff et al. (1982, J. Cell Biol., 95:654-666) have described a monoclonal antibody, CSAT, directed against a cell surface antigen that participates in the adhesion of skeletal muscle to extracellular matrices. We used the same antibody to compare and parse the determinants of adhesion and morphology on myogenic and fibrogenic cells. We report here that the antigen is present on skeletal and cardiac muscle and on tendon, skeletal, dermal, and cardiac fibroblasts; however, its contribution to their morphology and adhesion is different. The antibody produces large alterations in the morphology and adhesion of skeletal myoblasts and tendon fibroblasts; in contrast, its effects on the cardiac fibroblasts are not readily detected. The effects of CSAT on the other cell types, i.e., dermal and skeletal fibroblasts, cardiac muscle, 5-bromodeoxyuridine-treated skeletal muscle, lie between these extremes. The effects of CSAT on the skeletal myoblasts depends on the calcium concentration in the growth medium and on the culture age. We interpret these differential responses to CSAT as revealing differences in the adhesion of the various cells to extracellular matrices. This interpretation is supported by parallel studies using quantitative assays of cell-matrix adhesion. The likely origin of these adhesive differences is the progressive display of different kinds of adhesion-related molecules and their organizational complexes on increasingly adhesive cells. The antigen to which CSAT is directed is present on all of the above cells and thus appears to be a lowest common denominator of their adhesion to extracellular matrices.

The possible role of a 140K membrane-associated protein complex (140K) in fibronectin-cytoskeleton associations has been examined. The 140K was identified by the monoclonal antibody JG22E. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to the 140K showed identical patterns of binding to the cell membranes of fixed and permeabilized chicken embryonic fibroblasts; localization was diffuse, but with marked concentration in cell-to-extracellular matrix contact sites. Correlative localization with interference reflection microscopy and double-label or triple- label immunofluorescence showed that 140K co-distributed with extracellular fibronectin fibrils and intracellular alpha-actinin in microfilament bundles at extracellular matrix contact sites but tended not to co-localize with tropomyosin present in bundles at sites farther from adhesion sites. In addition, binding of antibodies to 140K, alpha- actinin, and fibronectin was excluded from vinculin-rich focal adhesion sites at the cellular periphery. A progressive development of cell surface alpha-actinin-140K-fibronectin associations was observed in early spreading cells. The anti-140K monoclonal antibody JG22E inhibited the attachment and spreading of both normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryonic fibroblasts to a fibronectin substratum. However, the anti-140K monoclonal antibody became a positive mediator of cell attachment and spreading if it was adsorbed or cross-linked to the substratum. Our results provide the first description of a membrane-associated protein complex that co-localizes with fibronectin and microfilament bundles, and they suggest that the 140K complex may be part of a cell surface linkage between fibronectin and the cytoskeleton.

Previous studies (Neff et al., 1982, J. Cell. Biol. 95:654-666; Decker et al., 1984. J. Cell. Biol. 99:1388-1404) have described a monoclonal antibody (CSAT Mab) directed against a complex of three integral membrane glycoproteins of 120,000-160,000 mol wt (CSAT antigen [ag]) involved in the cell matrix adhesion of myoblasts and fibroblasts. In localization studies on fibroblasts presented here, CSAT ag has a discrete, well-organized distribution pattern. It co-aligns with portions of stress fibers and is enriched at the periphery of, but not directly beneath vinculin-rich focal contacts. In this last location, it co-distributes with fibronectin, consistent with the suggestion that the CSAT ag participates in the mechanism by which fibroblasts attach to fibronectin. In prefusion myoblasts, which are rapidly detached by CSAT Mab, CSAT ag is distributed diffusely as are vinculin, laminin, and fibronectin. After fusion, myotubes become more difficult to detach with CSAT Mab. The CSAT ag and vinculin are organized in a much more discrete pattern on the myotube surface, becoming enriched at microfilament bundle termini and in lateral lamellae which appear to attach myotubes to the substratum. These results suggest that the organization of CSAT ag-adhesive complexes on the surface of myogenic cells can affect the stability of their adhesive contacts. We conclude from the sum of the studies presented that, in both myogenic and fibroblastic cells, the CSAT ag is localized in sites expected of a surface membrane mediator of cell adhesion to extracelluon of CSAT ag- adhesive complexes on the surface of myogenic cells can affect the stability of their adhesive contacts. We conclude from the sum of the studies presented that, in both myogenic and fibroblastic cells, the CSAT ag is localized in sites expected of a surface membrane mediator of cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The results from studies that use fibroblasts in particular suggest the involvement of CSAT ag in the adhesion of these cells to fibronectin.

Human umbilical endothelial cells (ECs) were grown on fibrillar type I collagen in 16.4-mm multiwell tissue culture plates. Human platelets were added to the wells, and platelet adhesion to collagen was examined by scanning electron microscopy and radioisotopic technique in the absence of ECs and in preconfluent and confluent EC cultures. Single adherent platelets of different shapes as well as small aggregates were seen on collagen surface. Human plasma fibronectin added to the system stimulated platelet adhesion and their spreading on collagen. ECs had no effect on the percentage of platelets adherent to collagen-coated gaps in preconfluent culture but decreased the number of spread platelets. It is demonstrated that collagen-coated gaps can bind 14C-labeled liposome--antibody and 14-C-labeled liposome--fibronectin conjugates. ECs grown on fibrillar collagen are suggested as useful models for screening of antiplatelet drugs and for the study of drug targeting to the areas of vascular injury for prevention of thrombosis.Images	Endothelial cell culture on fibrillar collagen: model to study platelet adhesion and liposome targeting to intercellular collagen matrix.

Fibrinogen, a clottable plasma protein, agglutinates both prokaryotic cells (e.g., staphylococci) and eukaryotic cell fragments (e.g., platelets) through interaction with specific receptors. To identify the region of the fibrinogen molecule responsible for its interaction with human platelets, we prepared polypeptide chain subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of human fibrinogen by reduction and carboxymethylation. A mixture of the chains induced aggregation (clumping) of human platelets separated from plasma proteins and treated with ADP. When individual chains of fibrinogen were tested, gamma-chain multimers caused platelet aggregation at a molar concentration comparable with that of intact human fibrinogen. The beta chain remained inactive, and the alpha chain was 1/4th to 1/5th as reactive as the gamma chain. Monospecific antibody fragments against the gamma chain inhibited binding of 125I-labeled fibrinogen to the human platelet receptor and blocked aggregation of platelets induced by ADP in the presence of fibrinogen or gamma-chain multimers. These results indicate that the gamma chain of human fibrinogen bears the main site for interaction with the platelet receptor.	gamma and alpha chains of human fibrinogen possess sites reactive with human platelet receptors.

The role of fibrinogen as a cofactor in platelet aggregation is mediated by its binding to platelet receptors that are induced by stimuli such as ADP. In the present study, we demonstrate that the tetrapeptide glycyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-proline inhibits the interaction of fibrinogen with its platelet receptor. The primary effect of the peptide was on the extent rather than on the rate of fibrinogen binding. Significant inhibition occurred at a 1:1 molar ratio of peptide to fibrinogen and reached maximal levels at 100:1 ratio. The inhibition was dependent upon fibrinogen concentration and occurred in the presence of calcium or magnesium. The peptide inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to platelets with exposed receptors, suggesting that it interfered directly with the ligand-receptor interaction. Fibrinogen binding supported by epinephrine and thrombin as well as ADP was inhibited by the peptide. Fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of washed platelets by ADP was abolished by a 30-fold molar excess of the peptide. The tetrapeptide is an analog of the amino-terminal sequence of the alpha-chain of fibrin and has been shown to inhibit fibrin polymerization [Laudano, A. P. & Doolittle, R. F. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 3085-3089]. A peptide corresponding to the natural sequence, glycyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-valyl-L-valine, was also capable of inhibiting fibrinogen binding to the platelet. These results suggest that common structural features within fibrinogen may serve a dual function by permitting the molecule to participate in both platelet aggregation and fibrin formation.

Human von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibrinogen are adhesive plasma glycoproteins essential for formation of a platelet hemostatic plug. We investigated the role of ADP and fibrinogen in binding of vWF to platelets in vitro. Binding of 125I-labeled vWF to human platelets separated from plasma proteins and treated with ADP was specific, and time and concentration dependent, reaching equilibrium at 20 min and approaching saturation at 12 micrograms/ml. The binding was inhibited by EDTA and by prostaglandin I2, a known activator of platelet adenylate cyclase. A purine nucleotide affinity analog, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (FSBA), which covalently modifies the ADP binding sites on the human platelet membrane, prevented binding of vWF induced with ADP, as well as with human thrombin and with ionophore A23187, agents known to cause platelet ADP secretion. By comparison, FSBA did not inhibit binding of vWF induced by ristocetin, indicating that the ristocetin mechanism is not dependent on ADP. Human fibrinogen inhibited in a competitive manner the ADP-induced binding of 125I-labeled vWF (9 micrograms/ml) with an IC50 of 25 micrograms/ml. Conversely, unlabeled vWF inhibited ADP-induced binding of 125I-labeled fibrinogen (60 micrograms/ml) with an IC50 of 16 micrograms/ml. A synthetic dodecapeptide (Mr, 1188), analogous with the specific platelet receptor recognition site of human fibrinogen gamma chain (gamma 400-411), inhibited binding of both 125I-labeled vWF and 125I-labeled fibrinogen to ADP-treated platelets, whereas it was without effect on binding of 125I-labeled vWF to ristocetin-treated platelets. These data indicate that vWF and fibrinogen have a common receptor mechanism for their interaction with human platelets that is dependent on ADP occupancy of its binding sites and is recognized by the sequence of 12 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus of the human fibrinogen gamma chain.

The ability of microsomal membranes to translocate nascent presecretory proteins across their lipid bilayer into the intravesicular space was investigated by using trypsin as a proteolytic probe. We found that under defined conditions trypsin is able to dissect the translocation activity of microsomal membranes into components that can be separated into two fractions, one soluble and the other membrane bound. The trypsinized membrane fraction has lost its translocation activity. Addition of the trypsin-generated soluble fraction, however, results in reconstitution of translocation activity. These results are compatible with the notion proposed in the signal hypothesis that the translocation activity of the microsomal membrane resides in transmembrane protein(s). We propose that trypsin effects solubilization from the membrane of cytosol-exposed domain(s) involved in recognition of the signal sequence or ribosome or both, leaving behind membrane-integrated domain(s) that provide the environment for the passage of the nascent chain across the membrane. Signal peptidase activity was unaffected by trypsinization of microsomal vesicles consistent with a localization of the active site of this enzyme on the cisternal side of the vesicles.Images	Tryptic dissection and reconstitution of translocation activity for nascent presecretory proteins across microsomal membranes.

Human class I transplantation antigens are cell-surface-expressedmolecules composed of one glycosylated, membrane-integrated heavy chain andone nonglycosylated, water-soluble subunit, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m).We have examined the intracellular transport of the two subunits bymicroinjecting mRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Beta 2m, translated inoocytes, was transported and secreted into the medium in the absence ofheavy chains whereas heavy chains were retained in the endoplasmicreticulum if not cotranslated with beta 2m. In the presence of beta 2m,heavy chains resisted digestion by endoglycosidase H (Endo H), suggestingthat beta 2m promotes the transport of heavy chains from endoplasmicreticulum to the Golgi compartment. Pulse-chase experiments confirmed thisnotion. The possibility that heavy chains aggregate irreversibly whensynthesized in the absence of beta 2m was ruled out and it is demonstratedthat performed heavy chains will become transported once beta 2m isavailable. It is suggested that intracellular transport is controlled bystructural features that are part of the transported polypeptide. If so,beta 2m but not heavy chains may possess such features.

Three fibronectin mRNAs exist in rat liver, differing by the presence or absence of segments of 285 or 360 bases at a point within the coding region. We previously proposed that the three mRNAs are encoded by a single gene and arise via alternative splicing of a common transcript. In order to test this hypothesis, we have isolated clones spanning approximately half of the fibronectin gene from a Fisher rat genomic library; blot hybridization analyses reveal the presence of only one fibronectin gene in the haploid rat genome. We determined the sequence of a portion (1221 nucleotides) of this gene. This sequence shows clearly that the three fibronectin mRNAs encoded by this gene are generated by a pattern of alternative splicing in which one 5' splice site can be paired with any one of three 3' splice sites, one at the beginning of, and two within, a single complex exon.Images	A single rat fibronectin gene generates three different mRNAs by alternative splicing of a complex exon.

A sensitive and rapid method for the detection of monoclonal antibodies secreted by hybridomas is described. Mouse myeloma cells are fused with spleen cells from immunized mice and directly cloned in soft agarose containing selective medium; hybrid clones can be seen after a week. Nitro-cellulose filters that have been coated with a specific protein antigen, with antigen-coupled erythrocyte ghosts, or with other cells used as antigens are then placed on the agarose surface. After incubation to allow immunoadsorption of any secreted antibodies specific for the filter-bound antigen, the filter is removed and overlaid with a suspension of antigen-coupled erythrocytes that react with the adsorbed antibodies; after unbound erythrocytes are allowed to fall off the filter, red spots delineate the sites at which antibody-forming clones are present in the agarose. Alternatively, the filter may be treated with radiolabeled antigen followed by autoradiography. The reliability and sensitivity of the method are demonstrated with alpha-(1 leads to 3)-specific antidextran myeloma J558, and the method's applicability is established by detecting hybridomas with specificities for sheep erythrocytes and for alpha-(1 leads to 3) dextran.Images	Detection of specific hybridoma clones by replica immunoadsorption of their secreted antibodies.

The distributions of both fibronectin (LETS, CSP) fibers and focal contacts to the substratum, as viewed by fluorescence and reflection contrast microscopy, respectively, have been compared in freshly plated WI-38 human fibroblasts. Most frequently, the actual focal attachment plaques did not contain fibronectin fluorescence and, furthermore, fibronectin spots and fibers often alternated with focal contacts. Overlap, however, was observed between focal contacts and the endings of actin-containing stress fibers [see also Wehland, J., Osborn, M. & Weber, K. (1979) J. Cell Sci. 37, 257-273]. Thus, the fibroblast attachment membrane might best be described as a corrugated sheet that undulates between alternating microfilaments and fibronectin fibers, at the points of closest and farthest distance to the substratum, respectively.Images	Corrugated attachment membrane in WI-38 fibroblasts: alternating fibronectin fibers and actin-containing focal contacts.

Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in the spreading and adhesion of cultured fibroblasts to their substrata. In this paper, double immunoelectron microscopic labeling experiments for fibronectin and for concanavalin A-binding proteins on the cell surface were carried out on ultrathin frozen sections of cultures of embryonic chicken heart fibroblasts. On cross sections though the focal adhesions of the cell to the substratum there was substantial labeling for concanavalin A-binding proteins but no detectable labeling for fibronectin, whereas both the binding proteins and fibronectin were extensively labeled elsewhere on the cell surface and substratum. These results demonstrate that fibronectin is not present within the sites of focal adhesions. Therefore, the functions of fibronectin in cell spreading and adhesion are not directly mediated through its binding at focal adhesion sites. An alternative model is presented which can account for such fibronectin functions.Images	Fibronectin is not present in the focal adhesions formed between normal cultured fibroblasts and their substrata.

Cultures of established and transformed fibroblasts were less able to contract a hydrated collagen gel than normal precrisis cells. Postcrisis fibroblasts from different rodent strains and species underwent a further reduction in contraction ability and either spontaneous or simian virus 40 (SV40) transformation. Human precrisis fibroblasts contracted much more efficiently than two SV40-transformed human lines. Fibroblasts from a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia were intermediate between all other human fibroblasts assayed and the SV40-transformed human lines. The absolute efficiency of contraction was dependent on temperature and serum concentration, but no conditions were found that resulted in equal efficiencies for the three types of cells. Precrisis cells were extremely sensitive to the passage procedures when assayed for collagen contraction.

A cell-type specific glycoprotein antigen (SFA) from fibroblast surface appears in human plasma and serum. The amount of SFA in serum was reduced if the blood coagulation clot was removed at a low temperature. SFA could be bound to Sepharose-conjugated fibrinogen and to fibrin powder at 0 degrees C and was subsequently released when the temperature was elevated to plus 37 degrees C. This procedure resulted in a 10-fold enrichment of SFA relative to other serum proteins. SFA was found to be concentrated in the cryoprecipitate fraction of human plasma and was copurified with the cold insoluble globulin (CIG) with procedures published for the purification of the latter component. SFA/CIG is not soluble at low temperatures as such and its appearance in the cryoprecipitate fraction of plasma is likely to be due to its affinity to cryofibrinogen evident from these experiments. The biological significance of the interaction of fibroblast surface SFA moleculres with fibrin(ogen) is not known.

We have identified a specific actin-binding site in the adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin, isolated from chicken fibroblasts. Affinity chromatography of fragments, released from fibronectin by limited proteolysis with trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin, on actin-Sepharose and other protein-Sepharose columns was used to locate the binding site. A 27 000-mol.wt. subtilisin-digest fragment bound efficiently to actin. The results suggest that the actin-binding site is close to, but not identical with, the reported collagen-binding site.ImagesFig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.

Previous studies of von Willebrand disease indicate that a deficiency of blood clotting Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/vWF) activity is responsible for the failure of platelets to participate fully in the initial stages of hemostasis. We have recently identified specific FVIII/vWF binding sites on platelets, suggesting that the interaction of these sites with FVIII/vWF may be functionally important in the development of platelet clumps. We have now studied how different ristocetin concentrations, various known platelet aggregation inhibitors, and the exposure of platelets to proteases affect the ability of platelets to bind FVIII/vWF and to form aggregates. Our results demonstrate a highly significant linear correlation between the degree of FVIII/vWF receptor binding and the extent of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. Because neither FVIII/vWF binding nor platelet aggregation occurs after platelets are exposed to low concentrations of proteases, the FVIII/vWF receptors must be in the platelet membrane. We conclude that the interaction between FVIII/vWF protein and its receptors on the platelet membrane is an important mechanism by which platelet aggregation occurs during primary phase hemostasis.

Human Factor VIII desialylated by treatment with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (ASVIII) aggregated human platelets in the absence of ristocetin in platelet-rich plasma and, to a lesser extent, in washed platelet suspensions. Aggregation is accompanied by thromboxane formation and is completely inhibited by EDTA. Aspirin blocks the second phase of aggregation and abolishes thromboxane production. Subaggregating doses of ASVIII and of either ADP, epinephrine, or collagen produce prompt and complete platelet aggregation. Bernard-Soulier syndrome platelets either did not aggregate with ASVIII (Two cases) or showed markedly decreased aggregation (one cases). Factor VIII complex was prepared from the plasma of two patients with variant von Willebrand's disease (sialic acid content 142 and 75 nmol/mg, respectively); neither protein generated platelet-aggregating activity upon desialylation. [3H]ASVIII binds rapidly to platelets and 37 degrees C, while tritiated, fully sialylated factor VIII binds to a negligible extent. As little as 1--2 micrograms ASVIII bound/10(9) platelets is capable of inducing platelet aggregation. ASVIII may be a useful tool for investigating platelet-Factor VIII interactions in the absence of ristocetin. Furthermore, desialylated Factor VIII might play a physiologic role in Factor VIII-mediated platelet reactions in vivo.	Properties of human asialo-factor VIII.

We used cholera toxin, which binds exclusively and with a high affinity to the ganglioside GM1, as a probe to investigate the distribution of this glycolipid on the surface of mouse lymphocytes. When lymphocytes are incubated with cholera toxin (or its B subunit) and then sequentially with horse anti-toxin and FITC-swine anti-horse Ig at 37 degrees C, the cholera toxin-ganglioside GM1 complex is redistributed to a cap at one pole of the cell. The capping of cholera toxin-GM1 complexes is slower than the capping of surface-Ig complexes, requires two antibodies, and is inhibited at high toxin concentrations. Cholera toxin-GM1, like surface-Ig capping, is an energy-dependent process and is inhibited by sodium azide, low temperatures, or cytochalasin B, but is unaffected by demecolcine. An affinity-purified antibody against alpha-actinin was used to examine the distribution of this cytoskeletal component during the capping process. 88% of the cells that had a surface Ig cap displayed a co-cap of alpha-actinin, and 57% of the cells that had a cholera toxin-GM1 cap displayed a co-cap of alpha- actinin. Time course studies revealed similar kinetics of external ligand cap formation and the formation of alpha-actinin co-caps. We conclude that capping of a cell-surface glycolipid is associated with a reorganization of the underlying cytoskeleton. The implications of such an association are discussed in the context of current models of the mechanism of capping.

The actin content of membranes prepared from cultured chick embryo fibroblasts has been measured on polyacrylamide gels. The actin was identified by tryptic peptide mapping. After transformation of the cells by Rous sarcoma virus, the amount of actin associated with the membranes is decreased by 30-50%. This result is not due to infection per se, since infection by a temperature-sensitive strain of the virus decreases membrane-associated actin only at the permissive temperature. A shift from the nonpermissive (41 degrees) to the permissive (36 degrees) temperature results in an increase in the percentage of total cellular protein synthesis devoted to actin production, so that the decrease in membrane-associated actin appears to be a selective displacement from the membrane rather than a general decrease in total cellular actin.

"This report presents the appearance of rapidly frozen, freeze-dried cytoskeletons that have been rotary replicated with platinum and viewed in the transmission electron microscope. The resolution of this method is sufficient to visualize individual filaments in the cytoskeleton and to discriminate among actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments solely by their surface substructure. This identification has been confirmed by specific decoration with antibodies and selective extraction of individual filament types, and correlated with light microscope immunocytochemistry and gel electrophoresis patterns. The freeze-drying preserves a remarkable degree of three-dimensionality in the organization of these cytoskeletons. They look strikingly similar to the meshwork of strands or ""microtrabeculae"" seen in the cytoplasm of whole cells by high voltage electron microscopy, in that the filaments form a lattice of the same configutation and with the same proportions of open area as the microtrabeculae seen in whole cells. The major differences between these two views of the structural elements of the cytoplasmic matrix can be attributed to the effects of aldehyde fixation and dehydration. Freeze-dried cytoskeletons thus provide an opportunity to study--at high resolution and in the absence of problems caused by chemical fixation--the detailed organization of filaments in different regions of the cytoplasm and at different stages of cell development. In this report the pattern of actin and intermediate filament organization in various regions of fully spread mouse fibroblasts is described."

"The ultrastructure of the apical zone of lactating rat mammary epithelial cells was studied with emphasis on vesicle coat structures. Typical 40-60 nm ID ""coated vesicles"" were abundant, frequently associated with the internal filamentous plasma membrane coat or in direct continuity with secretory vesicles (SV) or plasma membrane proper. Bristle coats partially or totally covered membranes of secretory vesicles identified by their casein micelle content. This coat survived SV isolation. Exocytotic fusion of SV membranes and release of the casein micelles was observed. Frequently, regularly arranged bristle coat structures were identified in those regions of the plasma membrane that were involved in exocytotic processes. Both coated and uncoated surfaces of the casein-containing vesicles, as well as typical ""coated vesicles"", were frequently associated with microtubules and/or microfilaments. We suggest that coat materials of vesicles are related or identical to components of the internal coat of the surface membrane and that new plasma membrane and associated internal coat is produced concomitantly by fusion and integration of bristle coat moieties. Postexocytotic association of secreted casein micelles with the cell surface, mediated by finely filamentous extensions, provided a marker for the integrated vesicle membrane. An arrangement of SV with the inner surface of the plasma membrane is described which is characterized by regularly spaced, heabily stained membrane to membrane cross-bridges (pre-exocytotic attachment plaques). Such membrane-interconnecting elements may represent a form of coat structure important to recognition and interaction of membrane surfaces."

Coated vesicles from the brain have been purified to near morphological homogeneity by a modification of the method of Pearse. These vesicles resemble sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from skeletal muscle. They contain proteins with 100,000- and 55,000-dalton mol wt which co-migrate on polyacrylamide gels, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, with the two major proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum fragment. These vesicles contain adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity which is stimulated by calcium ions in the presence of Triton X-100 (Rohm & Haas Co., Philadelphia, Pa.), displaying maximal activity at 8 x 10(-7) M Ca ++. They take up calcium ions from the medium, and this uptake is stimulated by ATP and by potassium oxalate, a calcium-trapping agent. The 100,000-dalton protein of the coated vesicles displays immunological reactivity with an antiserum directed against the 100,000-dalton, calcium-stimulated ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As with the sarcoplasmic reticulum fragment, this protein becomes radiolabeled when coated vesicles are briefly incubated with gamma-labeled [32P]ATP. The possible functions of coated vesicles as calcium-sequestering organelles are discussed.

Electron microscope radioautography has been used to study hormone- receptor interaction. At intervals of 3, 10, and 20 min after the injection of 125I-insulin, free hormone was separated from bound hormone by whole body perfusion with modified Ringer's solution. The localization of bound hormone, fixed in situ by perfusion with glutaraldehyde, was determined. At 3 min, 125I-insulin has been shown to be exclusively localized to the hepatocyte plasmalemma (Bergeron et al., 1977, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 74:5051--5055). In the present study, quantitation indicated that 10(5) receptors were present per cell and distributed equally along the sinusoidal and lateral segments of the hepatocyte plasmalemma. At later times, label was found in the Golgi region. At 10 min, both secretory elements of the Golgi apparatus and lysosome-like vacuoles were labeled, and at 20 min the label was especially concentrated over the latter vacuoles. Acid phosphatase cytochemistry showed that the vacuoles did not react and therefore were presumed not to be lysosomal. These Golgi vacuoles may constitute a compartment involved in the initial degradation and/or site of action of the hormone. Control experiments were carried out at all time intervals and consisted of parallel injections of radiolabeled insulin with excess unlabeled hormone. At all times in controls, label was diminished over hepatocytes and was found primarily over endothelial cells and within the macropinocytotic vesicles and dense bodies of these cells. Kupffer cells and lipocytes were unlabeled after the injection of 125I-insulin with or without excess unlabeled insulin.	Binding and uptake of 125I-insulin into rat liver hepatocytes and endothelium.

Human cell lines of hematopoietic origin were tested for production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). B-cell lines transformed by Epstein-Barr virus release a factor (referred to as hTNF) that is cytotoxic for mouse L cells sensitive to mouse TNF but not for L cells resistant to mouse TNF. Exposure to 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate augmented production of hTNF. hTNF activity was not found in supernatants of cell lines of T-cell, monocytic, or promyelocytic origin. Partially purified hTNF has a molecular weight of approximately 70,000, has no interferon activity, is acid labile, is destroyed by heating at 70 degrees C for 1 hr, induces cross-resistance to mouse TNF in vitro, and causes hemorrhagic necrosis of Meth A mouse sarcoma in the standard in vivo mouse TNF assay. Tests with a panel of 23 human cancer cell lines showed that hTNF is cytotoxic for 7 cell lines, cytostatic for 5, and has no effect on 11. Comparative studies with human alpha, beta, and gamma interferons indicated that sensitivity to hTNF and interferon can be distinguished. Combined treatment with hTNF and alpha or gamma interferon resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect.

To examine directly the hypothesis that T cell growth factor (TCGF) interacts with target cells in a fashion similar to polypeptide hormones, the binding of radiolabeled TCGF to various cell populations was investigated. The results indicate that TCGF interacts with activated T cells via a receptor through which it initiates the T cell proliferative response. Internally radiolabeled TCGF, prepared from a human T leukemia cell line and purified by gel filtration and isoelectric focusing, retained biological activity and was uniform with respect to size and charge. Binding of radiolabeled TCGF to TCGF-dependent cytolytic T cells occurred rapidly (within 15 rain at 37 degrees C) and was both saturable and largely reversible. In addition, at 37 degrees C, a receptor- and lysosome-dependent degradation of TCGF occurred. Radiolabeled TCGF binding was specific for activated, TCGF-responsive T cells. Whereas unstimulated lymphocytes of human or murine origin and lipopolysaccharide-activated B cell blasts expressed few if any detectable binding sites, lectin- or alloantigen-activated cells had easily detectable binding sites. Moreover, compared with lectin- or alloantigen-activated T cells, long-term TCGF-dependent cytolytic and helper T cell lines and TCGF-dependent neo-plastic T cell lines bound TCGF with a similar affinity (dissociation constant of 5-25 pM) and expressed a similar number of receptor sites per cell (5,000-15,000). In contrast, a number of TCGF-independent cell lines of T cell, B cell, or myeloid origin did not bind detectable quantities of radiolabeled TCGF. Binding of radiolabeled TCGF to TCGF-responsive cells was specific, in that among several growth factors and polypeptide hormones tested, only TCGF competed for binding. Finally, the relative magnitude of T cell proliferation induced by a given concentration of TCGF closely paralleled the fraction of occupied receptor sites. As the extent of T cell clonal expansion depends on TCGF and on the TCGF receptor, the dissection of the molecular events surrounding the interaction of TCGF and its receptor that these studies permit, should provide new insight into the hormonelike regulation of the immune response by this lymphokine.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a monocyte-derived protein cytotoxic or cytostatic for some tumor cell lines. Here we show that highly purified E. coli-derived recombinant human TNF stimulated the growth of human FS- 4 diploid fibroblasts. Stimulation of cell growth was demonstrable at a TNF concentration of 10 pg/ml (3 X 10(-13) M). Maximal stimulation was attained at TNF concentrations of 10 ng/ml (3 X 10(-10) M) or higher. Growth-stimulatory activity of TNF was inhibited by an mAb neutralizing the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation was not inhibited by another mAb specific for TNF, lacking neutralizing activity for the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation by TNF was more marked and more sustained in the presence of greater than or equal to 10% FCS than in medium with less than or equal to 5% FCS. Addition of TNF to confluent FS-4 cultures also produced a marked stimulation of cell growth in the presence of fresh FCS, while a much less marked stimulation was seen in the absence of FCS. Stimulation of confluent cultures by TNF in serum-free medium was enhanced by insulin, suggesting that insulin or insulin-like growth factor(s) in the serum can act synergistically with TNF in producing growth stimulation. While the growth-stimulatory effects of TNF and insulin were synergistic, the actions of TNF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were less than additive, suggesting that TNF and EGF may activate identical or similar pathways. We conclude that stimulation of cell growth is probably a physiological function of TNF, and that the cytotoxic and cytostatic actions of TNF may be the result of an anomalous growth signal transduction in neoplastic cells lacking the constraints of normal growth control mechanisms.

The morphological and biochemical consequences of treatment of human peripheral blood leukocytes with cytochalasin B were studied. Incubation of human polymorphs with cytochalasin B resulted in nuclear and cytoplasmic spreading, but not in spontaneous release of lysosomal enzymes. Cytochalasin B inhibited particle uptake. Consequently, phagocytic vacuoles were not observed; instead, granule contents were discharged directly into the surrounding medium when cytochalasin B-treated cells were challenged with zymosan particles. Cytochalasin B enhanced the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes whether these encountered zymosan particles or immune complexes on a nonphagocytosable Millipore filter. Cytochalasin B-treated leukocytes thus constitute a model system for quantitative study of lysosome fusion. Augmented enzyme release was blocked by prior treatment of cells with pharmacological doses of agents that influence the accumulation of cyclic nucleotides (cyclic nucleotides themselves, prostaglandin E1) or by compounds that interfere with microtubule function (e.g., colchicine, vinblastine). These observations suggest that one action of cytochalasin B on phagocytic cells is to remove the normal constraints to merger of granules, either with each other or with the plasma membrane, and that intact microtubule function is required for translocation of lysosomes.Images	Cytochalasin B: Effect on Lysosomal Enzyme Release from Human Leukocytes	Robert B.

Previous investigations have demonstrated that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the active principle of croton oil, stimulates alterations in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that resemble closely the changes that develop in the cells after phagocytosis of bacteria. The present study has compared the effects of PMA and heat-killed bacteria on the oxygen uptake, glucose oxidation, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, and ultrastructure of normal neutrophils and PMN from six patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). PMA stimulated oxygen consumption, hexose monophosphate shunt activity, and NBT reduction in normal cells but failed to produce similar effects in CGD neutrophils. However, PMA did induce formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in the CGD cells similar to those observed in normal neutrophils. The results indicate that PMA is a useful nonparticulate agent for distinguishing between normal and CGD neutrophils and for studying basic mechanisms of phagocytosis in normal and abnormal PMN.Images	Effects of Phorbol Myristate Acetate on the Metabolism and Ultrastructure of Neutrophils in Chronic Granulomatous Disease	John E.

The influence of autonomic neurohormones on the immunologic release of β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) from, and the cyclic nucleotide levels in, human neutrophils was determined. Interaction of neutrophils with rheumatoid arthritic, serum-treated zymosan particles in a neutral balanced salt solution at 37° resulted in the extracellular discharge of β-glucuronidase without any loss of cell viability, as indicated by the failure of incubated cells to take up eosin Y or to release cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Epinephrine reduced the release of β-glucuronidase from neutrophils in the presence of zymosan during 2-30 min of incubation and elicited a concomitant elevation of adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate levels. Propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, but not phentolamine, an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist, blocked both actions of epinephrine. Acetylcholine stimulated the release of β-glucuronidase, but not lactate dehydrogenase, and provoked a concomitant elevation of guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate levels. Atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but not hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, inhibited both actions of acetylcholine. Interaction of neutrophils and zymosan particles resulted in an elevation of guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate levels within 2 min. These data suggest that intracellular guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate may be involved in mediating the immunologic release of lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophils whereas adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate may inhibit enzyme release. Moreover, autonomic neurohormones appear to be capable of modulating lysosomal enzyme release by virtue of their capacity to elevate neutrophil cyclic nucleotide levels.

The biologic role of calcium and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in the immunologic secretion of lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophils was studied. Contact of neutrophils with zymosan-treated serum or the divalent cation ionophore A-23187, in the presence of extracellular calcium, resulted in beta-glucuronidase (beta-D-glucuronide glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) secretion and a concomitant accumulation of cyclic GMP without any loss of cell viability. Acetylcholine (0.1 muM), in the presence of calcium, enhanced the immunologic stimulation of cyclic GMP accumulation and lysosomal enzyme discharge. A marked and rapid association of 45CaCl2 with neutrophils occurred during cell surface contact with zymosan-treated serum, and this effect on calcium association was enhanced with 0.1 muM acetylcholine. The precise mechanism of the neutrophil-calcium interaction is presently not well understood. However, the finding that 0.5-1.0 muM A-23187 also provoked a rapid association of extracellular calcium with neutrophils suggests that calcium mobilization into the intracellular environment may account, at least in part, for this association between cells and calcium. The close temporal relationship between beta-glucuronidase secretion, cyclic GMP accumulation, and calcium mobilization during cell contact with membrane active agents such as immune reactants, acetylcholine, and ionophores suggests that these three cellular events bear a cause and effect relationship. On the basis of our findings to date, we propose that the immunologic secretion of lysosomal contents from human neutrophils is signaled by intracellular cyclic GMP and that extracellular calcium, by gaining access to the intracellular processes responsible for cyclic GMP accumulation, serves as the link to stimulus-secretion coupling.

Arachidonic acid (AA) (66 microM) induced contractions of indomethacin-treated (8.4 microM) guinea-pig tracheal and lung parenchymal preparations. Mepacrine (210 microM) treatment did not affect the magnitude of contraction induced by AA. Normal and ovalbumin-sensitized tissues responded identically to AA, and released equivalent amounts of the contractile mediators. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (100 microM) markedly reduced release of the contractile mediators and reduced AA-induced contractions of the airways. The mediators of AA-induced, calcium ionophore A23187-induced, and antigen-induced contraction of the trachea and lung parenchyma were purified and identified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to be leukotrienes C4 and D4, being present in an approximate ratio of 20:1. Mepacrine-treated trachea exhibited a smaller contractile response to stimuli (A23187 for normal tissues and ovalbumin for sensitized tissues). Addition of exogenous AA (66 microM) increased the magnitude of contraction, although not to the level observed on tissues not treated with mepacrine. There was no observable effect of AA on the response of mepacrine-treated parenchyma to the ionophore or antigen. It was concluded that (a) immunological sensitization does not alter AA metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway in guinea-pig airways and (b) the mediators of AA-induced contraction are leukotrienes C4 and D4.

Thymocytes cultured with irradiated, allogeneic stimulator cells yield no cytotoxic effector cells after a period in culture. If, however, a population of irradiated spleen cells syngeneic to the responder cells are added to these cultures, cytotoxicity is generated. The helper activity present in the irradiated syngeneic spleen cells was found to be mediated by a cell bearing theta antigens. Furthermore, it was found to be antigen specific; helper cells which were tolerant of the stimulator cell antigens were unable to help the thymocyte responder cells, although these tolerant cells did contain helpers specific for a third party antigen. These experiments are consistent with a requirement for associative recognition of linked determinants in the induction of killer precursors which is thus strictly analogous to the induction of B-cell precursors via collaboration with helper T cells. In more extensive studies, it was found that histoincompatible helper cells (H-2b, H-2p, H-2q) were able to help a cytotoxic T cell (H-2k) response to a third party stimulator cell antigen (H-2d); that is, the helper T cells which interact with cytotoxic T-cell precursors are not strain specific. It seems likely that the histocompatible helper cells induce killer precursors in an antigen-specific cooperation event similar or identical to normal syngeneic cooperation.

Concanavalin A stimulation of T-cell cytotoxicity has been shown to be absolutely dependent on helper T-cell collaboration. Thymocytes stimulated with ConA do not differentiate to yield cytotoxic effector cells. However, thymocytes cocultured with irradiated spleen cells as helpers and ConA yield high levels of cytotoxicity. The helper cell bears theta antigens on its surface, is not an adherent cell, and does not require any adherent cell functions in our culture conditions. The ConA-dependent helper cells appear to be polyclonal in specificity. Thus, polyclonal stimulation of cytotoxicity by ConA requires T helper- T precursor collaboration in analogy to antigen-specific T helper-T precursor interactions. Unlike the antigen-specific interacitons, the ConA-driven cytotoxicity does not appear to require linked associative recognition for induction of cytotoxicity.

Mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in unidirectional mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC) using normal C57BL/6 spleen cells as responding cells and irradiated DBA/2 spleen cells as stimulating cells. Cytotoxicity was assayed on 51Cr-labeled P-815 (DBA/2) target cells, and the relative frequency of CTL in individual cell populations was estimated from dose-response curves. Upon inclusion of 2-mercaptoethanol in the culture medium, it was found that significant CTL activity could be detected for as long as 3 wk in primary MLC. Reexposure of MLC cells to the original stimulating alloantigens after 14–41 days in culture resulted in significant cell proliferation and rapid regeneration of high levels of immunologically specific cytotoxicity. CTL activity in these secondary cultures increased dramatically within the first 24 h and reached higher peak levels than those found at the peak of the primary response. Furthermore, proliferation and reappearance of CTL activity could be demonstrated following each of as many as four sequential alloantigenic stimulations of the same initial cell population at 20-day intervals. Interestingly, cells recovered from MLC at the peak of the primary response on day 4 were insensitive to further allogeneic stimulation. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that CTL differentiate in MLC to become long-lived memory cells which gradually lose their cytotoxic activity. Upon reexposure to specific alloantigen, such memory CTL rapidly regain their functional activity and proliferate to generate an expanded CTL population.

Murine helper T cells activated to sheep or horse erythrocyte antigens in vivo have been established as continuous cell lines in culture. T cells require the presence of a T-cell growth factor (TCGF) for continuous proliferation. TCGF purified from murine, rat, or human sources all stimulate murine T-cell growth. The T-cell mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin do not stimulate cell proliferation in continuous T-cell lines. All cells that grow in the presence of TCGF express Thy-1 antigens. Helper activity of T-cell lines is both antigen specific and effective for syngeneic or F1 B cells. Supernates from T-cell lines do not contain antigen-specific or nonspecific helper factors. Although several T-cell lines have shown stable helper activity for greater than 50 wk in culture, other cell lines have shown a gradual decline in effector function. The procedure used to establish and maintain proliferation of T cells in culture should be suitable for the selection and growth of antigen-specific effector T cells from each subclass.

An allogeneic effect factor (AEF) derived from mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) cultures of alloactivated A.SW (H-2s) responder T cells and irradiated A/WySn (H-2a) stimulator spleen cells helps an in vitro primary anti-erythrocyte plaque-forming cell PFC response of BALB/c nude spleen cels and also A/WySn but not A.SW T cell-depleted spleen cells. AEF activity is adsorbed by anti-Ik and anti-I-Ak but not by anti-I-Jk, anti-I-ECk, and anti-Is. Gel filtration of ACA 54 resolves AEF into two main components that which appear in the 50,000- to 70,000- mol wt (component I) and 30,000- to 35,000-mol wt (component II) regions, respectively. Component I has a mol wt of 68,000, elutes from DEAE-Sephacel at 0.05-0.1 M NaCl, and has an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.8. It helps A/WySn but not A.SW B cells and, therefore, is H-2 restricted. Component II is not H-2 restricted, because it helps both A.SW and A/WySn B cells. It also stimulates (a) the growth of a long- term cytotoxic cell line in vitro, (b) Con A-induced thymocyte mitogenesis, and (c) the generation of cytotoxic T cells. The latter three properties of component II are not shared by component I. In addition, component II elutes from DEAE-Sephacel at 0.15-0.2 M NaCl and has a pI of 4.3 and 4.9. Ia determinants and Ig VH, CH, L-chain, and idiotypic determinants are not present on either component I or component II. The properties of component II are identical to that of a T cell growth factor produced by Con A-stimulated spleen cells. It is suggested that the H-2-restricted component I of AEF might be an MLR- activated responder T cell-derived Ia alloantigen receptor.	In vitro analysis of allogeneic lymphocyte interaction. V.

"Albumin, transferrin, and lipids can replace serum entirely for support of LPS-stimulated murine B lymphocytes in culture. In the presence of these compounds, growth and maturation to IgM and IgG secretion, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), occurs at the same or higher efficiency in serum-free conditions as in conventional serum-containing medium, even at relatively low cell concentrations. In contrast to the rapid disappearance of LPS reactivity in conventional serum-containing medium, responsiveness remains at initial levels in serum-free conditions for 2 days before slowly declining. Overall lymphocyte survival is also markedly prolonged. In the presence of thymus ""filler"" cells, the serum-free conditions permit growth of every LPS-responsive cell to a clone of Ig-secreting cells at dilutions as low	as a single reactive B cell per culture. The results have several important implications. These include the establishment for the first time of transferrin as a requirement for B lymphocyte responses in culture, and the availability now of conditions for the assay isolation of cell products regulating lymphocyte function, free of interference from undefined serum components."

One of three splenic B cells of 2- to 3-mo-old C57BL/6J or C3H/Tif mice are activated either by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by lipoprotein (LP) to grow and to mature to IgM-secreting cells. When mitogen-activated blast cells, after a 2-d activation period, are separated from nonactivated, small cells by velocity sedimentation, and no mitogen is readded, the blasts do not continue to grow but do continue to secrete IgM for several days. When the homologous mitogen is added for restimulation, the blast cells continue for several days to divide every 18 h and to develop IgM-secreting, plaque-forming cells. Frequency analyses at limiting dilutions of reactive B-blasts show that one cell in approximately equal to 1.2--1.5 blasts continue to grow and mature in the presence of the homologous mitogen, either LPS or LP. When the B-cell blasts obtained in a first activation period with either LPS or LP are restimulated with a heterologous mitogen, LPS, LP, Nocardia mitogen or mitogens contained in fetal calf serum a high proportion of the blasts continue to grow and mature to IgM-secreting cells. Frequency analyses show for LPS- or LP-blasts, restimulated in a heterologous fashion with either LP or LPS, that one cell in 1.35--1.5 blasts continue to divide and to mature to IgM-secreting cells. C3H/HeJ- splenic B-cells, which are LPS nonresponders, can only be activated to blast cells by LP. These LP-activated blasts can be restimulated by the homologous LP and by Nocardia mitogen and mitogens of fetal calf serum, but not by LPS. The results indicate that the majority of splenic B cells of 2- to 3-mo-old C57BL/6J or C3H/Tif mice are reactive to more than one B-cell mitogen. B cells, therefore, can possess in their surface membrane multireactive mitogen-receptor complexes which regulate growth and maturation.

The purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD tuberculin) stimulates approximately one of two lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B-cell blasts of C57BL/6J nu/nu spleen cells to continued clonal growth and maturation to IgM and IgG secretion. It alwo stimulates background, in vivo-activated large cells of normal C57BL/6J nu/nu spleen to growth and Ig secretion, at a frequency of approximately 1 of 100 large spleen cells. PPD tuberculin, therefore, is a polyclonal B-cell activator for B-cell blasts. Many single murine splenic B cells (approximately 50%) appear to have reactivities, and therefore probably receptors, for LPS and PPD tuberculin. PPD tuberculin does not stimulate small, resting B cells to growth as measured by the number of cells in culture and by thymidine uptake. However, it stimulates approximately one-fourth of all spleen cells to blast transformation. The large-size blast cells secrete IgM and, therefore, form plaques in the protein A plaque assay. IgG-secreting, plaque-forming cells develop at later stages of stimulation, indicating that the switch from IgM to IgG may occur without division in single, stimulated B cells. Stimulation of resting B cells to maturation by PPD tuberculin is polyclonal. Thus, approximately 1 in 10(2) IgM-secreting plaque-forming cells form plaques with trinitrophenyl-substituted sheep erythrocytes, 1 in 450 do so with horse erythrocytes, and 1 in 10(3) with sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, the number of Ig-secreting cells developing from small, resting cells without growth in cultures with or without filler thymus cells suggests polyclonal activation by PPD tuberculin to maturation only of at least one out of four small, splenic B cells.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B-cell blasts from C57BL/6J nu/nu spleen cells develop into IgM-secreting clones after stimulation by antigen-specific T-helper cells of C57BL/6J origin. Although induction of help is antigen-dependent, help itself acts polyclonally. 1 of 1--3 B-cell blasts is restimulated in a homologous fashion by LPS, or in a heterologous fashion by sheep erythrocyte (SRC)- or horse erythrocyte (HRC)-activated T-helper cells. The repertoire of activated B-cell blasts reflects the polyclonal nature of activation: approximately 1 in 1,000--3,000 restimulated B-cell blasts is specific for SRC, 1 in 300-- 1,000 is specific for HRC, and 1 in 100--300 specific for trinitrophenylated SRC (TNP30-SRC). B-cell blasts that are either H-2 compatible or H-2 incompatible with the antigen-activated T-cell help are stimulated polyclonally in similar high frequencies. Thus, neither antigen nor H-2 compatibility are required to stimulate a B-cell blast into the next cell cycle.

Cloned lines of helper thymus-derived (T) cells produce help for bone marrow-derived (B) cell growth and Ig secretion in the presence of histocompatible adherent cells and of specific antigen. This help stimulates histocompatible as well as histoincompatible B-cell blasts polyclonally. Thus, neither antigen nor histocompatibility, but antigen-unspecific factor(s) for growth and Ig secretion are required to stimulate a B-cell blast through the next round of division. On the other hand, only histocompatible, resting, small B cells, and only those binding their specific antigen, can be stimulated by antigen-activated T-cell help to initiate growth and Ig secretion. The preference of the resting B cells for such collaboration with T-cell help is mapped to the K end of the H-2 histocompatibility locus, and probably constitutes the antigen expressed on B cells by the immune response (I) region. It appears that a resting B cell is excited by the binding of specific antigen to surface Ig and by the interaction of its surface Ia antigen with helper T cells. After this dual recognition the excited B cell can be stimulated by the antigen-unspecific factor(s) generated by the interaction of helper T-cells, adherent cells, and antigen to initiate replication.	T-cell-dependent B-cell stimulation is H-2 restricted and antigen dependent only at the resting B-cell level.	J Andersson, M H Schreier, F Melchers	6966402	1980-03-01	4	
The fusion of an AKR T cell tumor line to normal B6D2F1, T cells resulted in the production of a cloned T cell hybridoma (FS6-14.13) inducible with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A). The supernate from Con A-stimulated hybridoma cells was active both in the stimulation of an anti-sheep red blood cell response by partially T cell-depleted B cells and in the stimulation of the growth of antigen-specific T cell blasts. The active principle in both assays had a molecular weight of approximately 30-40,000. These results indicated the presence of interleukin 2 (IL2) in the hybridoma supernate. The activity of the hybridoma supernate in B cell responses was dependent on the presence of adherent cells and a few contaminating T cells. On the other hand, Con A-stimulated supernates from normal spleen cells were active after either adherent cell removal or severe T cell depletion. These results suggested that IL2 was the only active helper factor in the hybridoma supernate, but that additional helper factors were present in supernates from Con A-stimulated normal spleen cells.

Mouse spleen cells can be stimulated to proliferate in vitro by purified anti-mu or anti-gamma,kappa antibodies. These responses can be obtained in cell populations bearing  membrane immunoglobulin (Ig), purified by the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), but they are not observed in FACS-purified Ig- cell populations. Furthermore, treatment of spleen cell populations with anti-Thy 1.2 and complement does not impair the response, nor does addition of nylon wool-purified T lymphocytes enhance it. These results indicate that B lymphocytes respond to anti-Ig and that their response does not require T cells. On the other hand, cells from athymic nude (nu/nu) mice respond slightly less well to anti-mu than do cells from heterozygous littermate (nu/+) controls; nu/nu cells are almost unresponsive to anti-gamm,kappa and addition of nylon wool-purified T cells from nu/+ controls does not restore the response. This suggests that T lymphocytes or the thymus may control the appearance of cells responsive to anti-gamma,kappa. Responsiveness of normal mice to anti-mu does not appear until 4 wk of age and does not reach maximum levels until 8 wk of age. Acquisition of full responsiveness to anti-gamma,kappa is even more delayed. This, together with the failure of mice with the CBA/N B-cell defect to respond to anti-Ig, suggests that cells stimulated to proliferate by anti-Ig are a mature subset of B cells. Depletion of adherent cells by Sephadex G-10 treatment or by treatment with carbonyl iron and exposure to a magnetic field does not diminish anti-mu or anti-gamma,kappa responses, suggesting that the responsiveness does not require the presence of macrophages. Thus, activation of B-cell proliferation by anti-Ig appears to be a T-cell independent, macrophage-independent process in which membrane Ig plays a direct role in signal generation.

We have examined the expression of I-region antigens on functional subpopulations of murine T cells. A.TH anti-A.TL (anti-Ik, Sk, Gk) alloantiserum was raised by immunization of recipients with concanavalin A (Con A) stimulated thymic and peripheral T-cell blasts. In contrast to similar antisera made by conventional methods, the anti- Ia blast serum was highly cytotoxic for purified T lymphocytes. Moreover, it reacted in a specific fashion with T cells having particular functions. Treatment of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)- primed B10.A (H-2 alpha) T cells with this antiserum plus complement resulted in the elimination of helper activity for B-cell responses to trinitrophenyl-KLH. Inhibition was shown to be a result of the selective killing of one type of helper T cell whose activity could be replaced by a factor(s) found in the supernate of Con A-activated spleen cells. A second type of helper cell required for responses to protein-bound antigens appeared to be Ia-. By absorption and analysis on H-2 recombinants, at least two specificities were detectable on helper T cells; one mapping in the I-A subregion and a second in a region(s) to the right of I-J. In addition, the helper T cell(s) involved in the generation of alloreactive cytotoxic lymphocytes was shown to be Ia+, whereas cytotoxic effector cells and their precursors were Ia- with this antiserum. These results provide strong evidence for the selective expression of I-region determinants on T-cell subsets and suggest that T-cell-associated Ia antigens may play an important role in T-lymphocyte function.

In semisolid agar cultures containing mercaptoethanol, cells from the spleen, lymph nodes, marrow, peritoneal cavity, thoracic duct, and blood of normal mice generated clusters and colonies of up to 3,000 cells. Colony numbers and growth were markedly enhanced by the addition of sheep red cells. The frequency of colony-forming cells in the spleen or lymph nodes was 0.5-2.0%, and cluster forming cells were approximately five times more numerous. The mononuclear cells comprising these colonies had the electronmicroscopic morphology of immature lymphoid and plasma cells. The majority of the cells possessed Fc receptors, 61-69% reacted with anti-mu-serum and 4-11% with anti- gamma2-serum. Analysis of single cells from individual colonies indicated a higher frequency of the cells with membrane immunoglobulin and a clonal pattern of anti-mu or anti-gamma-reactivity. The clonal nature of colonies was supported by an analysis of NIP-binding cells in colonies grown from CBA spleen cells enriched for NIP-binding cells. Mass-harvested colony cells synthesized immunoglobulin in short-term liquid cultures. It is concluded that the colonies are clones of functionally active B-lymphoid cells.

Gene products coded for by the major hisocompatibility complex (MHC) can serve as target antigens for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (1). A variety of test systems are available which have yielded information consistently reinforcing the importance of this complex of genes in the generation and effector phases of the cytotoxic immune response. Originally, it was shown that allogeneically-induced CTL had specificity primarily for the products of the K and D loci of the mouse H-2 complex (2). More recently this has also been found to be the case for xenogeneic immunizations (3,4). Additional examples of T cell-mediated lysis have been reported involving viral-infected or chemically- modified syngeneic stimulating and target cells in which homology at H-2K or H-2D was required between the responding and target cells for appreciable lysis to occur (5-7). Moreover, CTL specific for minor histocompatability antigens are able to lyse only target cells bearing these membrane antigens and sharing a common H-2K or H2-D gene product with the effector (8,9). Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the requirement for H-2 identity between effector and targets in these systems. CTL may recognize new antigenic determinants created by the interaction of the modifier with syngeneic K and D gene products. Alternately, a dual recognition system my exist, requiring an antigen-specific receptor as well as a second receptor with specificity for homologous H-2K or H-2D determinants (5). Neither model can be excluded at this time. The I region also contains genes coding for histocompatibility loci since animals differing at the I-A or I-C regions of the H-2 complex reject skin grafts (10-12), though less rapidly than mice differing at the H-2K or H-2D regions, Also CTL can be generated to I region determinants but less efficiently than CTL specific for H-2K or H-2D gene products (12-14). The question can therefore be raised, whether the I region minor histocompatibility loci function independently from the H-2K or H-2D loci or whether I region-specific cytolysis requires the participation of H-2K or H-2D gene products of the target cell. This communication illustrates the generation of CTL showing specificity for I region determinants in primary mixed lymphocyte cultures. Further, we demonstrate by genetic analysis and byt eh use of speficit alloantisera that CTL directed to Ia determinants (a) do not see these antigens as modifications of H-2K or H-2D gene products but as independent gene products coded for by the I region, and (b) they do not require interaction with target cells bearing the same H-2K or H-2D gene product as the effect CTL.

Determinants controlled by the I region of the murine H-2 complex provoked the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in both a secondary and primary mixed lymphocyte culture. The stimulating determinants appeared to be controlled by loci within the I-A subregion. The target antigens of the CTL generated were present on both lipopolysaccharide- and concanavalin-induced blast lymphocytes, but were barely detectable on phytohemagglutinin-induced blast cells. The stimulating capacity for CTL induction of a complete H-2 complex incompatibility by far exceeded the sum of H-2D/K-region and I-region incompatibility, respectively.

Skin grafts were reciprocally exchanged in pairs of congenic lines identical in all genes except those located in the central portion of the H-2 complex. Seven such lines were tested: 6R, B10.AQR, A.TL, A.TH, 7R, 9R, and B10.HTT. In all donor-recipient combinations at least some grafts were rejected. In combinations differing at the IA subregion (and other central H-2 regions or subregions), all first-set grafts were rejected within 3 wk after transplantation, and all second-set grafts were rejected within 10 days. In combinations differing at the IC subregion (and other central regions, but not at the IA subregion) between 60 and 100% of first-set grafts were rejected, but some grafts survived for over 100 days. Most of the second-set grafts were rejected within 1 mo after grafting. This behavior of skin grafts indicated the presence of two histocompatibility loci in the I region, a strong one and a weak one. This conclusion was confirmed by genetic mapping which placed the strong locus in the IA subregion and the weak locus in the IC subregion. We designate the former locus H-2A and the latter H-2C. The same strain combinations used for the skin grafting were also used for determination of the capacity of I-region antigens to function as targets in the in vitro cell-mediated lymphocytotoxicity (CML) assay. Spleen cells from mice presensitized in vivo by skin grafting were restimulated in vitro and tested against 51Cr-labeled concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide blasts. The testing revealed the presence in the I region of two loci coding for CML-target antigens. The two loci comapped with the H-2A and H-2C loci and were most likely identical to them. As in the skin grafting test, in the CML test, the H-2A antigens evoked stronger response than the H-2C antigens. Rejection of skin grafts across the H-2A and H-2C loci was accompanied by the production of Ia antibodies. Direct cytotoxic and absorption tests with Ia antibodies directed against antigens coded for by the IC subregion revealed the presence of IaC antigens on epidermal cells. We suggest that the products of Ia loci might function as transplantation antigens.	Histocompatibility antigens controlled by the I region of the murine H- 2 complex. I.

The regulation of B-cell and T-cell immune responses has been extensively examined and in the experimental animal appears to involve regulatory or “suppressor” T cells (1-4). The limitations of in vitro experimentation have made comparable study of nonpathological human suppression quite difficult (5). We report here an in vitro method that generates and quantitates suppressor activity in man after antigen-specific activation in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). The one-way MLC induces both a proliferative response (6) and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (7). Both of these responses are mediated by antigen-specific T-cell subpopulations (8,9) and have been correlated with recognitive and destructive phases of allograft rejection. Recent reports have examined the antigen reactivity of mouse (10,11), rat (12), or human (13,14) lymphocytes obtained after proliferation in MLC. In all cases, after the primary MLC proliferative peak, the recovered lymphocytes rapidly differentiate upon re-exposure to the initial stimulating population, but do so only weakly when exposed to a presumably noncross-reactive third-party stimulating population. Velocity sedimentation separation studies have shown that the blast cells produced in a primary MLC revert to small lymphocytes that rapidly differentiate into proliferating and/or cytotoxic T lymphocytes upon restimulation with the initial antigen (15). These findings demonstrate that positive selection for the responding population in primary MLC does exist and may account for at least part of the specificity of the secondary response. However, this positive selection does not preclude possible involvement of a suppressor mechanism. In fact we have detected suppressor activity in primary MLC sensitization cultures at a time when the proliferation responsible for positive selection does not preclude possible involvement of a suppressor mechanism. In fact we have detected suppressor activity in primary MLC sensitization cultures at a time when the proliferation responsible for positive selection in not yet significant, suggesting that suppression may be overriding importance in the specificity of MLC-activated secondary responses.

Re-exposure of day 14 mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) cells to the original stimulating alloantigens (secondary response) has previously been shown to result in significant proliferation and in rapid reappearance of high levels of cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity within the next 4 days. Moreover, evidence has been presented that CTL precursor cells in day 14 MLC populations, while they derived from cells were large at peak of the primary response (day 4) were themselves small lymphocytes which developed into large CTL after restimulation. In this study, inhibition of DNA synthesis by cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) was used to investigate whether CTL formation could be dissociated from proliferation during the secondary response. It was found that within the first 24 h after restimulation (a) CTL activity increased 6-to-20-fold, (b) 60-70% of the small T lymphocytes became medium- to large-sized cells, and (c) both events were independent of DNA synthesis. By using two successive cell separations by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity, before and after stimulation of day 14 MLC cells for 24 h in the presence or absence of ARA-C, direct evidence was obtained that small CTL precursor cells developed into large CTL, irrespective of DNA synthesis. The presence of ARA-C for periods longer than 24 h inhibited any further increase in CTL activity, in contrast to a parallel increase in lytic activity and cell number from day 1 to day 4 in control restimulated cultures. Taken together with the finding that 90% of the medium- and large-sized lymphoid cells in control restimulated cultures underwent DNA synthesis within 24 h, these results thus suggest that during a secondary MLC response there is initially a differentiation step leading to the formation of CTL which, although it can be clearly dissociated from DNA synthesis, is under normal conditions followed by proliferation of these effector cells.

"Prior to gastrulation, the microtubules in the presumptive primary mesenchyme cells appear to diverge from points (satellites) in close association with the basal body of the cilium; from here most of the microtubules extend basally down the lateral margins of the cell. As these cells begin their migration into the blastocoel, they lose their cilia and adopt a spherical form. At the center of these newly formed mesenchyme cells is a centriole on which the microtubules directly converge and from which they radiate in all directions. Later these same cells develop slender pseudopodia containing large numbers of microtubules; the pseudopodia come into contact and fuse to form a ""cable"" of cytoplasm. Microtubules are now distributed parallel to the long axis of the cable and parallel to the stalks which connect the cell bodies of the mesenchyme cells to the cable. Microtubules are no longer connected to the centrioles in the cell bodies. On the basis of these observations we suggest that microtubules are a morphological expression of a framework which opeartes to shape cells. Since at each stage in the developmental sequence microtubules appear to originate (or insert) on different sites in the cytoplasm, the possibility is discussed that these sites may ultimately control the distribution of the microtubules and thus the developmental sequence of form changes."

"In the ectodermal cells of sea urchin blastulae, the microtubules converge and appear to make contact with three distinct cytoplasmic foci or satellites associated with the basal body of the cilium. Beneath the nucleus, which lies in the apical end of the cell, the microtubules are aligned predominantly parallel to the cell's long axis and could thus make contact with the satellites as is directly suggested by observations on sections at or near the planes of the satellites. After the embryos are treated with low temperature (0°C), the microtubules disassemble; however, the satellites can still be recognized. Upon rewarming, the microtubules reappear. In early stages of reformation, when the tubules in the cell consist of short segments, tubules have only been found in the apical part of the cell. One end of each microtubule appears to make contact with its respective satellite, or is aligned so that it could contact one of the satellites, provided serial sections were cut and collected in order. After longer periods of recovery, the microtubules elongate; as before, one end of each makes contact with a satellite or is aligned so that it could attach to a satellite. Segments of microtubules seen in the basal region of the cell are aligned parallel to the long axis of the cell as in the untreated ectodermal cells and are therefore interpreted as extensions of those tubules making contact with one of the satellites. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that assembly of microtubules is initiated at the satellites. These sites, perhaps best referred to as ""nucleating sites,"" thereby could exert considerable control over the distribution of microtubules in cells. It is hoped that this preliminary report will be followed up by a more detailed study using serial sections."

The majority of the colchicine-3H bound by tissue culture cells (KB or Hela) was found to be present as a noncovalent complex with a macromolecule which appears in the soluble fraction after homogenization. Similar binding was demonstrated in vitro and was confined to a component of the soluble fraction. The binding-equilibrium constant and the kinetic constants were essentially the same in vivo and in vitro. Bound radioactivity was reisolated and shown to be present in a molecule with the same chromatographic behavior and specific antimitotic activity as colchicine. In vitro assay of binding activity of a variety of cells and tissues showed a correlation with the presence of microtubules. High binding activity was given by dividing cells, mitotic apparatus, cilia, sperm tails, and brain tissue. Binding to extracts of slime mold or to purified muscle proteins was very low or undetectable. The binding site had a sedimentation constant of 6S and it is suggested that the protein is a subunit of microtubules.

Colchicine forms a complex in vivo with a protein present in fertilized or unfertilized sea urchin eggs; similar binding was obtained in vitro with the soluble fraction from egg homogenates. Kinetic parameters and binding equilibrium constant were essentially the same in vivo and in vitro. The binding site protein was shown to have a sedimentation constant of 6S by zone centrifugation. The protein was present in extracts of the isolated mitotic apparatus at a concentration which was several times higher than in whole-egg homogenates. It was extracted from the mitotic apparatus at low ionic strength under conditions which lead to the disappearance of microtubules. No binding could be detected to the 27S protein, previously described by Kane, which is a major protein component of the isolated mitotic apparatus. The properties of the colchicine-bindinG protein, (binding constant, sedimentation constant, Sephadex elution volume) are similar to those obtained with the protein from mammalian cells, sea-urchin sperm tails, and brain tissue, and thus support the conclusion that the protein is a subunit of microtubules.

Sea-urchin sperm tails (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were obtained by amputation in synthetic sea water and were purified by differential centrifugation. Most of the arms of the outer nine doublets and soluble matrix proteins were removed by this treatment. The central pairs of microtubules were dissolved by dialysis against EDTA at pH 7.5. The extract contained essentially a single component, with a sedimentation constant of 6S, in amounts sufficient to account for the protein content of the central pairs. Incubation of the extract with colchicine-3H gave binding levels approaching 0.5–1.0 mole of colchicine per 105 g protein. Sucrose-gradient analysis showed that the bound-radioactivity profile coincided with the optical-density profile of the 6S protein. It is concluded that the 6S colchicine-binding protein is a subunit of microtubules.	ISOLATION OF A PROTEIN SUBUNIT FROM MICROTUBULES	M. L. Shelanski, E. W. Taylor	6035644	1967-08-01	4	
The subunit protein has been isolated from the central-pair and outer-doublet microtubules of sea urchin sperm tails. Both proteins have a sedimentation constant of 6S and a molecular weight of 120,000. Both are converted to a 60,000 molecular weight species by denaturation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and reduction with mercaptoethanol. The reduced-alkylated proteins have the same Rf on disc electrophoresis, and the same amino acid composition, which is very similar to that of muscle actin. The central-pair protein has one binding site for colchicine per 120,000 g. Both proteins appear to have a guanine nucleotide binding site, but the ability to bind GTP in solution has been demonstrated only for the central-pair protein. Although 1 mole of guanine nucleotide is bound per 60,000 g to outer-doublet tubules, the protein obtained by dissolving the doublets at pH 10.5 has lost the guanine nucleotide-binding site and also shows little or no colchicine-binding activity. Comparison of the properties of the isolated protein with electron microscopic evidence on structure of microtubules suggests that the chemical subunit (M = 120,000) consists of two of the 40 A morphological subunits.

"To experimentally test the suggestion made in the preceding paper that the microtubules are involved in cell shape development during the formation and differentiation of the primary mesenchyme, we applied to the embryos two types of agents which affect cytoplasmic microtubules: (a) colchicine and hydrostatic pressure, which cause the microtubules to disassemble, and (b) D2O, which tends to stabilize them. When the first type of agent is applied to sea urchin gastrulae, the development of the primary mesenchyme ceases, the microtubules disappear, and the cells tend to spherulate. With D2O development also ceases, but the tubules appear ""frozen,"" and the cell asymmetries persist unaltered. These agents appear to block development by primarily interfering with the sequential disassembly and/or reassembly of microtubules into new patterns. The microtubules, therefore, appear to be influential in the development of cell form. On the other hand through a careful analysis of the action of these agents and others on both intra- and extracellular factors, we concluded that the microtubules do rather little for the maintenance of cell shape in differentiated tissues."

We have found that vinblastine sulfate can precipitate a number of proteins in addition to microtubule protein. Those proteins which precipitate with vinblastine sulfate, all of which were derived from structure, also precipitate with Ca2+ ions. Our results suggest that vinblastine sulfate, presumably acting as a cation, precipitates proteins by combining with sites which can also combine with Ca2+ ions.

Tubulin, the subunit protein of microtubules, is a dimer that sediments at 6 S and has a molecular weight of 110,000. Using high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have demonstrated the presence of two peptide chains, of molecular weight 56,000 and 53,000, in tubulin purified from brain. Two peptide chains of similar molecular weight were identified in each of the A- and B-tubulins isolated from flagella of sea urchin sperm. In all cases, the protein concentrations in the bands were equal. Each of the subunits ran as a single band when eluted from the gel and electrophoresed again in the same type of gel. Chromatography of purified brain tubulin on DEAE-Sephadex columns gave only a single peak containing both subunits in equal amounts.Cyanogen bromide peptides were prepared from each of the bands after elution from polyacrylamide gel. While certain of the peptides appear to be common to both subunits, substantial differences exist between them. The tubulin dimer is composed of two nonidentical subunits.Images	Heterogeneity of Tubulin Subunits	Howard Feit, Lidia Slusarek, Michael L. Shelanski	5289362	1971-09-01	4	
Intact A microtubules isolated from outer doublet microtubules of Chlamydomonas flagella contain two separable proteins (tubulins) that differ in molecular weight and in amino-acid composition. The microtubule protein isolated from brain or neuroblastoma cells also has two electrophoretically distinct tubulins. Although the two tubulins of brain and neuroblastoma cells are electrophoretically similar to each other, only one of these tubulins migrates with the flagellar tubulins. This is the first evidence that (a) isolated, morphologically intact, single microtubules from flagella contain at least two different tubulins, and (b) at least one of these tubulins differs from tubulins that are isolated from other sources.Images	Comparison of the Microtubule Proteins of Neuroblastoma Cells, Brain, and Chlamydomonas Flagella	J.

"Methods were developed for the isolation of Chlamydomonas flagella and for their fractionation into membrane, mastigoneme, ""matrix,"" and axoneme components. Each component was studied by electron microscopy and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified membranes retained their tripartite ultrastructure and were shown to contain one high molecular weight protein band on electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-urea gels. Isolated mastigonemes (hairlike structures which extend laterally from the flagellar membrane in situ) were of uniform size and were constructed of ellipsoidal subunits joined end to end. Electrophoretic analysis of mastigonemes indicated that they contained a single glycoprotein of ∼ 170,000 daltons The matrix fraction contained a number of proteins (particularly those of the amorphous material surrounding the microtubules), which became solubilized during membrane removal. Isolated axonemes retained the intact ""9 + 2"" microtubular structure and could be subfractionated by treatment with heat or detergent. Increasing concentrations of detergent solubilized axonemal microtubules in the following order: one of the two central tubules; the remaining central tubule and the outer wall of the B tubule; the remaining portions of the B tubule; the outer wall of the A tubule; the remainder of the A tubule with the exception of a ribbon of three protofilaments. These three protofilaments appeared to be the ""partition"" between the lumen of the A and B tubule. Electrophoretic analysis of isolated outer doublets of 9 + 2 flagella of wild-type cells and of ""9 + 0"" flagella of paralyzed mutants indicated that the outer doublets and central tubules were composed of two microtubule proteins (tubulins 1 and 2) Tubulins 1 and 2 were shown to have apparent molecular weights of 56,000 and 53,000 respectively"	CHLAMYDOMONAS FLAGELLA I.

Two cell-associated forms of the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed G1 and G2, have been resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. G1 has the higher electrophoretic mobility, but both forms migrate more slowly than G protein synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free system (G0), which presumably is the unglycosylated form. G1 is a kinetic precursor of the G2 form, and the apparent cause of the electrophoretic difference between the two species is the presence of N-acetylneuraminic acid on the G2 form. Conversion of G1 to G2 occurs 10 to 20 min prior to the appearance of the G2 form of the protein on the cell surface. This suggests that the G protein may be completely glycosylated several minutes prior to its migration to the cell surface and that glycosylation is not the limiting step in its maturation. No glycoprotein comigrating with G0 can be detected in the infected cells, even after 5-min labeling periods; this suggests that partial clycosylation of G occurs concomitantly with or immediately after its synthesis.Images	Localization of two cellular forms of the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein.

Glycosylation of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus was examined using virus-infected HeLa cells that were pulse-labeled with radioactive sugar precursors. The intracellular sites of glycosylation and the stepwise elongation of the carbohydrate side chains of the G protein were monitored by membrane fractionation and gel filtration of Pronase-digested glycopeptides. The results with short pulses of sugar label (5 to 10 mtein linkage (glucosamine and mannose) are added to G which was associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum-enriched membrane fraction, whereas the more distal sugars (galactose, sialic acid, fucose, and possibly more glucosamine) are added in the light-density internal membrane fraction. Accumulation of mature G was observed in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction. The gel filtration studies indicated that the initial glycosylation event may be the en bloc addition of a mannose and glucosamine oligomer, followed by the stepwise addition of the more distal sugars.Images	Glycosylation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein in virus-infected HeLa cells.

The association of vesicular stomatitis virus proteins with intracellular and plasma membranes was examined by pulse and pulse-chase labeling of virus-infected HeLa cells with [35S]methionine and separation of cell homogenates into three major membrane fractions in discontinuous sucrose gradients. The glycoprotein G was primarily associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum-like membranes after short radioactive pulses (2 to 4 min) but accumulated in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction and the smooth internal membrane fraction with longer pulse or chase periods. The nucleocapsid protein N and the matrix protein M accumulated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane-like fractions but not in the smooth internal membrane fraction. Only a fraction (35 to 40%) of the viral protein synthesized during a short pulse in the mid-cycle of infection was apparently utilized in released virus. The newly synthesized virus proteins first appeared in released virus in the order: M, N and L, and G.Images	Association of vesicular stomatitis virus proteins with HeLa cell membranes and released virus.

The glycoproteins of microsomes and cytosol were studied. Various washing procedures did not release the proteins from the microsomes, and immunological tests demonstrated that the sialoproteins are not serum components. Low concentrations of deoxycholate and incubation in 0.25 M sucrose solution liberated a small amount of microsomal sialoprotein and this fraction exhibited a high degree of labeling of protein-bound N-acetylneuraminic acid. A part of the glycoprotein fraction could not be solubilized, even with a high concentration of the detergent. Thoroughly perfused rat liver contained sialoproteins in the particle-free supernate. The level of sialoprotein present could not be due to contamination with serum or broken organelles. The high in vivo incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into protein-bound sialic acid of Golgi membranes and cytosol was paralleled by a delayed and lesser rate of incorporation into the rough and smooth microsomal membranes. This incorporation pattern suggests the possibility that the glycoproteins of cytosol and Golgi may later be incorporated into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Cell fractionation and protein electrophoresis were used to study the intracellular sites of synthesis and intermediate structures in the assembly of the virion proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus. Each of the three major virion proteins assembled into virions through a separable pathway. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was first a soluble protein and later incorporated into free, cytoplasmic nucleocapsids. A small amount of N protein was bound to membranes at later times, presumably representing either nucleocapsids in the process of budding or completed virions attached to the cell surface. The matrix (M) protein also appeared to be synthesized as a soluble protein, but was then directly incorporated into membranous structures with the same density as whole virus. Very little M protein was ever found in membranes banding at the density of plasma membranes. The M protein entered extracellular virus very quickly, as though it moved directly from a soluble state into budding virus. In contrast, the glycoprotein (G) was always membrane bound; it appeared to be directly inserted into membranes during its synthesis. Glycosylation of the G protein was completed only in smooth membrane fractions, possibly in the Golgi apparatus. After a minimum time of 15 min following its synthesis, G protein was incorporated into the surface plasma membrane, from which it was slowly shed into virions. These multiple processing steps probably account for its delayed appearance in virus. From this work it appears that the three major structural proteins come into the surface budding structure through independent pathways and together they coalesce at the plasma membrane to form the mature virion.Images	Separate pathways of maturation of the major structural proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus.

Maturation of viral proteins in cells infected with mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus was studied by surface iodination and cell fractionation. The movement of G, M, and N proteins to the virion bud appeared to be interdependent. Mutations thought to be in G protein prevented its migration to the cell surface, allowed neither M nor N protein to become membrane bound, and blocked formation of viral particles. Mutant G protein appeared not to leave the endoplasmic reticulum at the nonpermissive temperature, but this defect was partially reversible. In cells infected with mutants that caused N protein to be degraded rapidly or prevented its assembly into nucleocapsids, M protein did not bind to membranes and G protein matured to the cell surface, but never entered structures with the density of virions. Mutations causing M protein to be degraded prevented virion formation, and G protein behaved as in cells infected by mutants in N protein. These results are consistent with a model of virion formation involving coalescence of soluble nucleocapsid and soluble M protein with G protein already in the plasma membrane.Images	Maturation of viral proteins in cells infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus.

Sialoproteins isolated from the soluble fraction of rat liver could be incorporated into microsomal membranes. This incorporation was dependent on protein concentration, time, and temperature. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins after in vitro incorporation showed four major sugar-containing peaks and was similar to that found after in vivo labeling. Most of the incorporated protein was tightly bound to the microsomal membrane. Gel filtration and ion- exchange chromatography revealed the presence of several cytosolic glycoproteins that could be incorporated into microsomes. During prolonged centrifugation in a KBr solution with a density of 1.21 a highly labeled ([3H]glucosamine) protein (mole wt approximately to 70,000) that was actively incorporated into microsomes could be recovered in the upper region of the tube. These results demonstrate that several cytoplasmic glycoproteins of rat liver are transferred into microsomal membranes and that one of these is a lipoprotein.

The presence in the Golgi fraction of glycoproteins destined to be incorporated into the microsomal membrane was investigated. When incubated in sucrose, washed Golgi vesicles released four major, weakly acidic glycoproteins, some of which could be incorporated into microsomal membranes by incubation. Double labeling with [3H]glucosamine and [14C]leucine demonstrated the incorporation of both protein and oligosaccharide moieties, and the main peak of radioactivity was associated with the 70,000 mol wt region after SDS- gel electrophoresis. The proteins that could be incorporated into microsomes were probably associated to a large extent with the outer surface of the Golgi membrane. Centrifugation of the proteins released from the Golgi in a KBr solution (p = 1.24) resulted in a separation of glycoproteins, those in the top layer most actively incorporated into microsomes. The lipoglycoproteins in the top layer that could be incorporated appeared in the 70,000 mol wt region after SDS-gel electrophoresis, as did the corresponding proteins isolated from the supernate. These results suggest that glycoproteins with completed oligosaccharide chains are released from the Golgi system to the cytosol and are subsequently transferred to microsomes as constitutive membrane components.

Rough and smooth microsomes were shown to have similar sets of polypeptide chains except for the proteins of ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). More than 50 species of polypeptides were detected by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, ranging in molecular weight from 10,000 to approximately 200,000 daltons. The content of rough and smooth microsomes was separated from the membrane vesicles using sublytic concentrations of detergents and differential centrifugation. A specific subset of proteins which consisted of approximately 25 polypeptides was characteristic of the microsomal content. Some of these proteins showed high rates of in vivo incorporation of radioactive leucine or glucosamine, but several others incorporated only low levels of radioactivity within short labeling intervals and appeared to be long-term residents of the lumen of the ER. Seven polypeptides in the content subfractions, including serum albumin, contained almost 50% of the leucine radioactivity incorporated during 5 min and cross-reacted with antiserum against rat serum. Almost all microsomal glycoproteins were at least partly released with the microsomal content. Smooth microsomes contained higher levels of albumin than rough microsomes, but after short times of labeling with [3H]leucine the specific activity of albumin in the latter was higher, supporting the notion that newly synthesized serum proteins are transferred from rough to smooth portions of the ER. On the other hand, after labeling for 30 min with [3H]glucosamine, smooth microsomes contained higher levels of radioactivity than rough microsomes. This would be expected if glycosidation of newly synthesized polypeptides proceeds during their transit through ER cisternae. The labeling pattern of membrane proteins in microsomes obtained from animals which received three daily injections of [3H]leucine, the last administered 1 day before sacrifice, followed the intensity of bands stained with Coomassie blue, with a main radioactive peak corresponding to cytochrome P 450. After the long-term labeling procedure most content proteins had low levels of radioactivity; this was especially true of serum proteins which were highly labeled after 30 min.

Several methods have been devised for the isolation and labeling of structural components of spermatozoa. Rodent spermatozoa were cleaved rapidly and specifically at the junction of the heads and tails by treatment with various proteases, and the separate components were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Treatment with reducing agents released the mitochondrial membranes from the midpiece, exposing the underlying tail structures.Mouse spermatozoa were found to contain about 107 sites per cell that bind concanavalin A; most of the sites appear to be on the head, for fluorescein-labeled conjugates of concanavalin A were bound mainly to the acrosomal region. Binding of concanavalin A resulted in rapid agglutination of spermatozoa; mixed agglutinates could be formed with somatic cells, as well as with spermatozoa of other species. Fluorescent probes (naphthalenesulfonic acids) bound to the sperm plasma-membrane and caused an immediate loss of motility. In contrast, ethidium bromide bound to the nuclear structures, but did not cause immediate immobilization. These isolation and probing procedures should facilitate detailed chemical analysis of the major components of mammalian spermatozoa.Images	Molecular Probes of Spermatozoan Structures	Gerald M.

Two proteins (ribophorins I and II), which are integral components of rough microsomal membranes and appear to be related to the bound ribosomes, were shown to be exposed on the surface of rat liver rough microsomes (RM) and to be in close proximity to the bound ribosomes. Both proteins were labeled when intact RM were incubated with a lactoperoxidase iodinating system, but only ribophorin I was digested during mild trypsinization of intact RM. Ribophorin II (63,000 daltons) was only proteolyzed when the luminal face of the microsomal vesicles was made accessible to trypsin by the addition of sublytical detergent concentrations. Only 30--40% of the bound ribosomes were released during trypsinization on intact RM, but ribosome release was almost complete in the presence of low detergent concentrations. Very low glutaraldehyde concentrations (0.005--0.02%) led to the preferential cross-linking of large ribosomal subunits of bound ribosomes to the microsomal membranes. This cross-linking prevented the release of subunits caused by puromycin in media of high ionic strength, but not the incorporation of [3H]puromycin into nascent polypeptide chains. SDS- acrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked samples a preferential reduction in the intensity of the bands representing the ribophorins and the formation of aggregates which did not penetrate into the gels. At low methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate (MMB) concentrations (0.26 mg/ml) only 30% of the ribosomes were cross-linked to the microsomal membranes, as shown by the puromycin-KCl test, but membranes could still be solubilized with 1% DOC. This allowed the isolation of the ribophorins together with the sedimentable ribosomes, as was shown by electrophoresis of the sediments after disruption of the cross-links by reduction. Experiments with RM which contained only inactive ribosomes showed that the presence of nascent chains was not necessary for the reversible cross-linking of ribosomes to the membranes. These observations suggest that ribophorins are in close proximity to the bound ribosomes, as may be expected from components of the ribosome- binding sites.

Rat liver rough microsomes (RM) contain two integral membrane proteins which are not found in smooth microsomes (SM) and appear to be related to the presence of ribosome-binding sites. These proteins, of molecular weight 65,000 and 63,000, were designated ribophorins I and II, respectively. They were not released from the microsomal membranes by alkali or acid treatment, or when the ribosomes were detached by incubation with puromycin in a high salt medium. The anionic detergent sodium deoxycholate caused solubilization of the ribophorins, but neutral detergents led to their recovery with the sedimentable ribosomes. Ribosomal aggregates containing both ribophorins, but few other membrane proteins, were obtained from RM treated with the nonionic detergent Kyro EOB (2.5 X10(-2) M) in a low ionic strength medium. Sedimentation patterns produced by these aggregates resembled those of large polysomes but were not affected by RNase treatment. The aggregates, however, were dispersed by mild trypsinization (10 microgram trypsin for 30 min at 0 degrees C), incubation with deoxycholate, or in a medium of high salt concentration. These treatments led to a concomitant degradation or release of the ribophorins. It was estimated, from the staining intensity of protein bands in acrylamide gels, that in the Kyro EOB aggregates there were one to two molecules of each ribophorin per ribosome. Sedimentable complexes without ribosomes containing both ribophorins could also be obtained by dissolving RM previously stripped of ribosomes by puromycin- KCl using cholate, a milder detergent than DOC. Electron microscope examination of the residue obtained from RM treated with Kyro EOB showed that the rapidly sedimenting polysome-like aggregates containing the ribophorins consisted of groups of tightly packed ribosomes which were associated with remnants of the microsomal membranes.

Rat liver rough microsomes were labeled enzymatically with 125I using lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase. In intact microsomes only proteins exposed on the outside face of the microsomal membrane were iodinated. Low concentrations of detergent (0.049% deoxycholate) were used to allow entrance of the iodination system into the vesicles without disassembling the membranes. This led to iodination of the soluble content proteins and to an increased labeling of the membrane proteins. The distribution of radioactivity in microsomal proteins was analyzed after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most membrane proteins were labeled when intact microsomes were iodinated. No major membrane proteins were exclusively labeled in the presence of low detergent concentrations or after complete membrane disassembly. Therefore it is unlikely that there are major membrane proteins, other than glycoproteins, present only on the inner membrane face or completely embedded within the microsomal membrane. Microsomal proteins were also labeled by incubating rough microsomes with [3H]-NaBH4 after reaction with pyridoxal phosphate. Microsomal membranes were permeable to these small molecular weight reagents as shown by the fact that proteins in the vesicular cavity as well as membrane proteins were labeled with this system.

The distribution of a major glycoprotein (fibronectin) of human fibroblast cultures was studied in immunoelectron microscopy with peroxidase- or ferritin-labeled antibodies. External fibronectin was visualized in pericellular structures, in some areas on the growth substratum, and to a lesser degree in close association with the upper and lower surface membranes of the cell. The pericellular fibronectin- containing structures consisted of amorphous or vaguely fibrillar material forming strands or patches, 50-500 nm in diameter; the structures appeared to mediate distant cell-to-cell and cell-to- substrate contacts. When in close association with the plasma membrane, fibronectin markers were seen as discrete patches. The exact relationship between this form of fibronectin and the plasma membrane, however, remained open. Filamentous material was commonly seen in the cortical cytoplasm under patches of membrane-associated fibronectin. The distribution that we observed is consistent with the proposed roles of fibronectin in cell interactions with neighboring structures and with its presence in vivo as an extracellular glycoprotein in connective tissue matrix and basal laminae.

"The major cell surface glycoprotein of chick embryo fibroblasts, cellular fibronectin (formerly known as CSP or LETS protein), was purified and used to produce monospecific antisera. After affinity purification, the anti-fibronectin was used to investigate fibronectin's localization, its transfer from intracellular to extracellular pools, its antibody-induced redistribution on the cell surface, and its role in cell shape. Anti-fibronectin localizes to extracellular fibrils located under and between sparse cells, and to a dense matrix that surrounds confluent cells. Cellular fibronectin is also present in granular intracytoplasmic structures containing newly synthesized fibronectin before secretion. This intracellular staining disappears 2 h after treatment with cycloheximide or puromycin, and returns after removal of these protein synthesis inhibitors. In pulse- chase experiments using cycloheximide, fibronectin was sequentially transferred from the intracellular to the fibrillar extracellular forms. Transformation of chick fibroblasts results in decreases in both extracellular and intracellular fibronectin, and in altered cell shape. Treatment of untransformed chick fibroblasts with anti-fibronectin results in rapid (30 min) alteration to a rounder cell shape resembling that of many transformed cells. These rapid shape changes are followed by a slow, antibody-induced redistribution of fibronectin to supranuclear caplike structures. This ""capping"" is inhibited by metabolic inhibitors. Reconstitution of cell surface fibronectin onto transformed cells restores a more normal fibroblastic phenotype. The reconstituted fibronectin on these cells organizes into fibrillar patterns similar to those of untransformed cells. As with untransformed cells, treatment of these reconstituted cells with anti-fibronectin also results in cell rounding and ""capping"" of fibronectin."

The physiology of protein intracellular transport and secretion by cell types thought to be free from short-term control has been compared with that of the pancreatic acinar cell, using pulse-chase protocols to follow biosynthetically-labeled secretory products. Data previously obtained (Tartakoff, A.M., and P. Vassalli. J. Exp. Med. 146:1332-1345) has shown that plasma-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion is inhibited by respiratory inhibitors, by partial Na/K equilibration effected by the carboxylic ionophore monensin, and by calcium withdrawal effected by the carboxylic ionophore A 23187 in the presence of ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and absence of calcium. We report here that both inhibition of respiration and treatment with monensin slow secretion by fibroblasts, and also macrophages and slow intracellular transport (though not discharge per se) by the exocrine pancreatic cells. Attempted calcium withdrawal is inhibitory for fibroblasts but not for macrophages. The elimination of extracellular calcium or addition of 50 mM KCl has no major effect on secretory rate of either fibroblasts or macrophages. Electron microscopic examination of all cell types shows that monensin causes a rapid and impressive dilation of Golgi elements. Combined cell fractionation and autoradiographic studies of the pancreas show that the effect of monensin is exerted at the point of the exit of secretory protein from the Golgi apparatus. Other steps in intracellular transport proceed at normal rates. These observations suggest a common effect of the cytoplasmic Na/K balance at the Golgi level and lead to a model of intracellular transport in which secretory product obligatorily passes through Golgi elements (cisternae?) that are sensitive to monensin. Thus, intracellular transport follows a similar course in both regulated and nonregulated secretory cells up to the level of distal Golgi elements.

"The three Golgi fractions isolated from rat liver homogenates by the procedure given in the companion paper account for 6–7% of the protein of the total microsomal fraction used as starting preparation. The lightest, most homogeneous Golgi fraction (GF1) lacks typical ""microsomal"" activities, e.g., glucose-6-phosphatase, NADPH-cytochrome c-reductase, and cytochrome P-450. The heaviest, most heterogeneous fraction (GF3) is contaminated by endoplasmic reticulum membranes to the extent of ∼15% of its protein. The three fractions taken together account for nearly all the UDP-galactose: N-acetyl-glucosamine galactosyltransferase of the parent microsomal fraction, and for ∼70% of the activity of the original homogenate. Omission of the ethanol treatment of the animals reduces the recovery by half. The transferase activity is associated with the membranes of the Golgi elements, not with their content. Galactose is transferred not only to N-acetyl-glucosamine but also to an unidentified lipid-soluble component."	GOLGI FRACTIONS PREPARED FROM RAT LIVER HOMOGENATES II. Biochemical Characterization	J.

"Lipoprotein particles (d less than 1.03 g/ml) were isolated from rough and smooth microsomes and from the Golgi apparatus of rat liver, and were characterized chemically and morphologically. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) particles were rich in protein (50%) and contained phospholipids (PLP) and triglycerides (TG) in smaller amounts, whereas the lipoprotein particles emanating from the smooth ER, and especially the Golgi apparatus, were rich in TG and PLP, resembling very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) of serum. The difference in chemical composition among the particles was associated with change in size both in situ and in isolated lipoprotein fractions. The rough ER particles were 200-800  A in diameter (mean similar to 420 A); the smooth er particles 200-900 A (mean similar to 520 A); the Golgi particles 350-950 A (mean similar to 580A); and serum VLDL 300- 800 A (mean similar to 450 A). Generally, lipoprotein particles were rare in the rough ER, frequent but diffusely dispersed in smooth ER, and occurring mainly in clusters in ""secretory vesicles"" of the Golgi complex. They were seldom observed in the cisternal compartments of the Golgi complex. At short intervals (less than 15 min), intravenously injected radioactive glycerol was preferentially channelled into TG, whereas at later time points the majority of the isotope was recovered in the PLP. Three TG pools were distinguished: (a) a cytoplasmic pool with a slow turnover rate; (b) a membrane-associated TG pool; and (c) a pool corresponding to the TG moiety of lipoprotein particles, which showed the highest initial rate of labeling and fastest turnover. When, after pulse labeling, the appearance of incorporation of radioactive glycerol into TG or PLP of isolated lipoproteins was followed from one subcellular fraction to the other, a sequence of labeling was noted. During the first interval, TG from both rough and smooth microsomal lipoproteins displayed a high rate of labeling with peak value at 6 min, followed by a quick fall-off, while the Golgi lipoproteins reached maximal level at 10-20 min after administration. There was an interval of 10-15 min before the appearance of labeled VLDL in serum. It is concluded that the assembly of the apoproteins and lipid moieties into lipoprotein particles-presumed to be precursors of liver VLDL-begins in the rough ER and continues in the smooth ER. Also, there is a parallel change in chemical composition and size of the lipoprotein particles as they make their way through the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Some remodeling of the particles may take place in the Golgi apparatus before discharge into the circulation."

Colchicine, both in vitro and in vivo, inhibits secretion of albumin and other plasma proteins. In vitro, secretion by rat liver slices is inhibited at 10-minus 6 M with maximal effect at 10-minus 5 M. Inhibition of secretion is accompanied by a concomitant retention of nonsecreted proteins within the slices. Colchicine does not inhibit protein synthesis at these concentrations. Vinblastine also inhibits plasma protein secretion but lumicolchicine, griseofulvin, and cytochalasin B do not. Colchicine also acts in vivo at 10-25 mumol/100 g body weight. Inhibition of secretion is not due to changes in the intracellular nucleotide phosphate levels. Colchicine, administered intravenously, acts within 2 min and its inhibitory effect lasts for at least 3 h. Colchicine has no effect on transport of secretory proteins in the rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum but it causes these proteins to accumulate in Golgi-derived secretory vesicles.

Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles are packaged by the Golgi apparatus into vacuoles which move to the plasma membrane and empty the particles into the space of Disse, via exocytosis. Traditionally, all lipoprotein-containing cisternae and vacuoles are thought to be parts of this pathway. Observations reported here demonstrate that there is a second population of lipoprotein-containing cisternae and vacuoles. This population is part of GERL, an organelle we consider to be a specialized hydrolase-rich region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of GERL in normal rat hepatocytes.	Sites of lipoprotein particles in normal rat hepatocytes		201645	1978-01-01	4	
The participation of hepatic Golgi apparatus in the intracellular transport of blood-destined proteins has been analyzed using Golgi fractions enriched in cis and trans components of the Golgi apparatus. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the liver Golgi fractions showed several proteins corresponding in relative proportions and mobilities with serum proteins. After a pulse injection of labeled leucine, the secretory content of the cis Golgi fraction was labeled earlier than the trans Golgi fraction. Taken together, the results show the participation of the liver Golgi apparatus in the secretion of most of the serum proteins and provide documentation for a sequential progression of secretory protein through the cis and trans components of the Golgi apparatus.

The relationship between Golgi and cell surface membranes of intestinal cells was studied. These membranes were isolated from intestinal crypt cells and villus cells. The villus cell membranes consisted of microvillus membrane, a Golgi-rich fraction, and two membrane fractions interpreted as representing lateral-basal membranes. The villus cell microvillus membrane was purified by previously published techniques while the other membranes were obtained from isolated cells by differential centrifugation and density gradient velocity sedimentation. The two membrane fractions obtained from villus cells and considered to be lateral-basal membranes were enriched for Na+,K+- ATPase activity, but one also showed enrichment in glycosyltransferase activity. The Golgi membrane fraction was enriched for glycosyltransferase activity and had low to absent Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Adenylate cyclase activity was present in all membrane fractions except the microvillus membrane but co-purified with Golgi rather than lateral-basal membranes. Electron microscopy showed that the Golgi fraction consisted of variably sized vesicles and cisternalike structures. The two lateral-basal membrane fractions showed only vesicles of smaller, more uniform size. After 125I labeling of isolated intact cells, radioactivity was found associated with the lateral-basal and microvillus membrane fractions and not with the Golgi fraction. Antibody prepared against lateral-basal membrane fractions reacted with the surface membrane of isolated villus cells. The membrane fractions from isolated crypt cells demonstrated that all had high glycosyltransferase activity. The data show that glycosyltransferase activity, in addition to its Golgi location, may be a significant property of the lateral-basal portion of the intestinal villus cell plasma membrane. Data obtained with crypt cells support earlier data and show that the crypt cell surface membrane possesses glycosyltransferase activity.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-secreting murine plasmablasts have been used to explore the cytologic site(s) of the successive modifications of the polypeptide H and L chains (steps of glycosylation, chain assembly, and polymerization) which occur during intracellular transport (ICT) and the interrelationships between these events. A combination of pulse- chase biosynthetic labeling protocols (using amino acids and sugars), subcellular fractionation, and electron microscope autoradiography was used in conjunction with inhibitors of glycosylation and agents (carboxyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone [CCCP] and monensin) which block Ig exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or Golgi cisternae. The data are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) Sugar addition and modification occur in three main steps: (a) en bloc addition of core sugars to nascent H chains, (b) partial trimming of these oligosaccharide chains in the RER, (c) quasiconcerted addition of terminal sugars (galactose, fucose, and sialic acid) in a very distal compartment between monensin-sensitive Golgi cisternae and the cell surface. (2) H and L chain assembly occurs between nascent H chains and a pool of free light chains present in the RER, followed by interchain disulfide bonding and rapid assembly of monomers into J chain- containing pentamers in the RER. Small amounts of various apparently non-obligatory intermediates in polymerization are also formed. (3) Carbohydrate addition is not required for chain assembly, polymerization, and secretion since completely unglycosylated chains (synthesized in the presence of deoxyglucose or tunicamycin) undergo polymerization and are secreted (although at a reduced rate). (4) Surface 8s IgM molecules do not represent a step in the IgM secretory pathway.	Plasma cell immunoglobulin M molecules.

Electron microscope autoradiography was used to study the cellular localization of seven glycoproteins rapidly cleared from the circulating plasma of rats and taken up by the liver. 1 and 15 min after intravenous administration of the 125I-glycoproteins, livers were fixed in situ by perfusion and processed for autoradiography. Autoradiographic grains in the developed sections were found to represent the intact 125I-ligand. A quantitative analysis of the distribution and concentration (density) of autoradiographic grains over the three major cell types of the liver was then performed. Three molecules, asialo-fetuin, asialo-orosomucoid, and lactosaminated RNase A dimer, the oligosaccharide chains of which terminate in galactose residues, were bound and internalized almost exclusively (greater than 90%) by hepatocytes. Conversely, four molecules, the oligosaccharide chains of which terminate in either N-acetyl-glucosamine (agalacto- orosomucoid) or mannose (ahexosamino-orosomucoid, preputial beta- glucuronidase, and mannobiosaminated RNase A dimer), were specifically bound and internalized by cells lining the blood sinusoids--that is, by Kupffer cells and endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were two to six times more active (on a cell volume basis) than were Kupffer cells in the internalization of these four 125I-ligands. Mannose and N- acetylglucosamine-terminated glycoproteins competed with each other for uptake into either endothelial cells or Kupffer cells, indicating that a single system recognized mannose or N-acetyl-glucosamine residues. Finally, agalacto-orosomucoid and ahexosamino-orosomucoid were also associated with hepatocytes, but competition experiments utilizing excess asialo-orosomucoid demonstrated that residual galactosyl residues were responsible for this association.

"Electron microscope autoradiographic and biochemical methods were used to study the intracellular fates of several 125I-glycoproteins, known to be specifically bound and internalized by the different cell types in the liver. At the earliest times examined (1--2 min), 125I- glycoproteins (ASGP) were localized predominantly along the sinusoidal front of hepatocytes. Analysis of the distribution of autoradiographic grains indicated that: (a) approximately 40--60% of the 125I-ligand could be ascribed to the plasmalemma; (b) a significant fraction had already been internalized; yet (c) very little 125I-ligand was present in the lysosome-Golgi region. Between 4 and 15 min after administration of 125I-ASGPs, there was a dramatic redistribution of autoradiographic grains from regions of the plasmalemma and peripheral cytoplasm (30% decrease) to the lysosome-Golgi region (30% increase). At longer times (30 min), there was continued drainage of 125I-ASGP into this region. The grain density over secondary lysosomes was 60--90 times higher than that over recognizable Golgi elements, clearly indicating that lysosomes were the ultimate destination of the 125I-ASGP. However, no more than 60% of the total 125I-ligand could be localized to lysosome- rich regions of the hepatocyte, with the remaining 40% primarily in the intermediate cytoplasm. Biochemical evidence for proteolysis of the internalized 125I-ASGP (presumably within lysosomes) was obtained when [125I]-mono-iodotyrosine was found in the liver (i.e., hepatocytes) at times later than 15 min. The temporal redistribution observed for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine-terminated glycoproteins (ahexosamino- orosomucoid and agalacto-orosomucoid, respectively) in endothelial cells indicated that the 125I-ligands resided in macropinocytic vesicles (1--15 min) before their ultimate residence in dense bodies (15 min). The same 125I-ligands were also localized to structures resembling secondary lysosomes in Kupffer cells. The lysosomal nature of ""these organelles"" was implied from the appearance of [125I]mono- iodotyrosine in the liver at later times. 125I-beta-glucuronidase followed the same intracellular pathway in both cell types but was not degraded."

The distribution of the three glycosyltransferases synthesizing the terminal trisaccharide sialic acid yields D-galactose yields N- acetylglucosamine present in many glycoproteins was determined in Golgi fractions prepared from rat liver homogenates by a modification of the procedure of Ehrenreich et al. (1973, J. Cell Biol. 70:671--684). The enzymes were assayed with asialofetuin, ovomucoid, and Smith-degraded ovomucoid as sugar acceptors. Careful adjustment of the pH of all sucrose solutions to 7.0 +/- 0.1 prevented enzyme inactivation, and allowed quantitative recoveries at every isolation step. The three morphologically and functionally different Golgi fractions GJ1, GF2, and GF3 showed (in that order) decreasing specific activities of all three enzymes, but the relative amounts and relative specific activities of the three transferases in any given fraction were nearly identical. Two marginal fractions, one extra heavy (collected on the gradient below GF3) and the other extra light (isolated by flotation from the postmicrosomal supernate) were found to contain recognizable Golgi elements. An enrichment of any transferase over the two others was not detected in either preparation. A partial release of content from a combined GF1+2 was achieved by treatment with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Low Triton/phospholipid ratios (less than 2 mg/mg) led to lysis of the vesicles and cisternae and loss of very low density lipoprotein particles (ascertained by electron microscopy), but failed to separate the transferases from each other; the three enzymes sedimented together with a population of empty vesicles to a density of approximately 1.08 g/ml.

A fraction of secretion granules has been isolated from rabbit parotid by a procedure which was found to be especially effective in reducing contamination resulting from aggregation and/or cosedimentation of granules with other cell particulates. The fraction, representing 15 percent (on the average) of the total tissue amylase activity, was homogeneous as judged by electron microscopy and contaminated to exceedingly low levels by other cellular organelles as judged by marker enzymatic and chemical assays. Lysis of the granules was achieved by their gradual exposure to hypotonic NaHCO3, containing 0.5 mM EDTA. The content and the membranes separated by centrifugation of the granule lysate were characterized primarily by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which indicated that the content was composed of a limited number of molecular weight classes of polypeptides of which three bands (having approximate mol wt 58,000, 33, 000, and 12,000) could be considered major components. The gel profile of the membrane subfraction was characterized by 20-30 Coomassie brilliant blue-staining bands of which a single species of mol wt 40,000 was the conspicuous major polypeptide. Two types of experiments employing gel electrophoretic analysis were carried out for identifying and assessing the extent of residual secretory protein adsorbed to purified granule membranes: (a) examination of staining and radioactivity profiles after mixing of radioactive secretion granule extract with nonradioactively labeled granule membranes and (b) comparison of gel profiles of secretion granule extract and granule membranes with those of unlysed secretion granules and secretory protein dischraged from lobules in vitro or collected by cannulation of parotid ducts, the last two samples being considered physiologic secretory standards. The results indicated that the membranes were contaminated to a substantial degree by residual, poorly extractable secretory protein even though assays of membrane fractions for a typical secretory enzyme activity (amylase) indicated quite through separation of membranes and content. Hence, detailed examination of membrane subfractions for residual content species by gel electrophoresis points to the general unity and sensitivity of this technique as a means for accurately detecting a defined set of polypeptides occurring as contaminants in cellular fractions or organelle subfractions.

A membrane subfraction obtained from secretion granules isolated from rabbit parotid has been shown to be contaminated by residual secretory proteins to an estimated level of 25-30% of its total protein. In the present study an additional contaminant has been identified by improved mixing experiments and by comparative peptide mapping of specific polypeptides recovered from gels of membrane and content subfractions. This contaminant coelectrophoresis with (and probably comprises the bulk of) the majority component of the membrane subfraction (mol wt approximately 40,000). The contaminating polypeptides can be removed to a large extent by treating the membranes with low concentrations of saponin in the presence of 0.3 M Na2SO4. Although this treatment disrupts the typical bilayer structure of the granule membrane, it does not appear to cause dissociation of its phospholipids or bona fide membrane proteins.

Phosphatase cytochemistry was used to distinguish between the Golgi apparatus and GERL (considered as a specialized region of endoplasmic reticulum [ER] at the inner [trans] aspect of the Golgi stack) in pancreatic exocrine cells of guinea pig, rat, rabbit, and hamster. The trans element of the Golgi stack exhibits thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) but no acid phosphatase (AcPase) activity. In contrast, GERL shows AcPase but no TPPase activity. The nascent secretory granules, or condensing vacuoles, are expanded cisternal portions of GERL. Continuities of condensing vacuoles with rough ER are suggested, and it is proposed that some secretory components may have direct access to the condensing vacuoles from ER. Connections of Golgi apparatus with GERL were not seen.	Studies of the secretory process in the mammalian exocrine pancreas. I. The condensing vacuoles		914894	1977-10-01	4	
Affinity-purified, monospecific rabbit antibodies against rat pancreatic alpha-amylase and bovine pancreatic alpha-chymotrypsinogen were used for immunoferritin observations of ultrathin frozen sections of mildly fixed exocrine pancreatic tissue from secretion-stimulated (pilocarpine) rats and from overnight-fasted rats and guinea pigs. The labeling patterns for both antibodies were qualitatively alike: Labeling occurred in (a) the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) including the perinuclear cisterna, in (b) the peripheral area between the RER and cis-Golgi face, and (c) all Golgi cisternae, condensing vacuoles, and secretory granules. Labeling of cytoplasmic matrix was negligible. Structures that appeared to correspond to rigid lamellae were unlabeled. Differences in labeling intensities indicated that concentration of the zymogens starts at the boundary of the RER and cis-side of the Golgi complex. These data support the view that the Golgi cisternae are involved in protein processing in both stimulated and unstimulated cells and that Golgi cisternae and condensing vacuoles constitute a functional unit.

In devising a new procedure for the isolation of Golgi fractions from rat liver homogenates, we have taken advantage of the overloading with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles that occurs in the Golgi elements of hepatocytes ∼90 min after ethanol is administered (0.6 g/100 g body weight) by stomach tube to the animals. The VLDLs act as morphological markers as well as density modifiers of these elements. The starting preparation is a total microsomal fraction prepared from liver homogenized (1:5) in 0.25 M sucrose. This fraction is resuspended in 1.15 M sucrose and loaded at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Centrifugation at ∼13 x 106 g·min yields by flotation three Golgi fractions of density >1.041 and <1.173. The light and intermediate fractions consist essentially of VLDL-loaded Golgi vacuoles and cisternae. Nearly empty, often collapsed, Golgi cisternae are the main component of the heavy fraction. A procedure which subjects the Golgi fractions to hypotonic shock and shearing in a French press at pH 8.5 allows the extraction of the content of the Golgi elements and the subsequent isolation of their membranes by differential centrifugation.

Free and membrane-bound polyribosomes were separated from liver homogenates and characterized by electron microscopy. Using the wheat germ cell-free translation system, total translation products of poly A+RNA extracted from free polyribosomes (poly A+RNAf) showed some correlation to total liver cytosol proteins. In contrast, translation products of poly A+RNA from membrane-bound polyribosomes (poly A+RNAmb) showed some similarity to rat serum. Antibody to purified rat serum albumin immunoprecipitated from only the translation products of poly A+RNAmb a single polypeptide of mol wt 68,000. i.e., 3,000 greater than secreted serum albumin. In contrast, antibody to detergent-extracted cytochrome b5 immunoprecipitated from only the translation products of poly A+RNAf a single polypeptide of mol wt 17,500, identical to that of microsomal cytochrome b5. A consideration of the known properties of cytochrome b5 is consistent with an exclusive site of synthesis on free ribosomes.

The Golgi apparatus is a key element in the ordered movement of secretory polypeptides from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane during secretion. It has been shown that cisternae that receive membranes from the reticulum are morphologically similar to the latter and that cisternae liberating secretory granules resemble that plasma membrane. By using an ultrastructural probe for membrane cholesterol, filipin, on freeze-fractured and thin-sectioned exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells, we have shown that an enrichment in filipin-cholesterol complexes takes places across the stacked cisternae of the Golgi apparatus; the reticulum-related (forming) cisternae are poor in such complexes, but the secretory granule-related (maturing) cisternae contain numerous complexes. Secretory granule membrane is also richly labeled with filipin-cholesterol complexes. The heterogeneous cholesterol distribution in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus, as shown by filipin, emphasizes the polarity of this organelle, in agreement with its role in organizing the traffic of the secretory polypeptides from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane.Images	Heterogeneous distribution of filipin--cholesterol complexes across the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.

The localization of a cell type-specific, soluble fibroblast surface antigen (SFA) was studied by immunofluorescence and by scanning electron microscopy of the same cells. The antigen had an uneven distribution forming streaks on chick embryo fibroblasts. It was localized to membrane processes and ridges, with a diameter of 50–200 nm. The processes extended from the periphery of the cells to the substratum or to other cells. Trypsin treatment completely removed detectable amounts of SFA. The antigen was detectable within 1 h after trypsin-treated cells were reseeded. The reappearance of SFA correlated with the restoration of membrane processes. Fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) showed loss of all or most SFA. When normal cells were transformed without subcultivation and trypsinization a fibrillar extracellular network of SFA remained under the transformed fibroblasts while the cells themselves were negative in immunofluorescence. When fibroblasts infected by RSV mutants were transferred to nonpermissive temperature for transformation new SFA was detected within 2 h. These data lead us to propose that loss of stabilizing and anchoring effect of SFA molecules in fibrillar cell surface structures may be critical in altered growth control and malignant transformation.

A major cell surface protein, CSP, of chick embryo fibroblasts has been shown to constitute up to 3% of total cell protein, and to be decreased after viral transformation. Its role in normal cell behavior is not known. We have isolated CSP from chick embryo fibroblasts by extraction with 1 M urea and find that these preparations of CSP agglutinate formalinized sheep erythrocytes at protein concentrations of under 2 mug/ml. In extracts of chick embryo cells, the quantity of such hemagglutinating activity parallels that of CSP determined by electrophoresis, and both are substantially decreased in chick cells transformed by the Bryan hightiter strain of Rous sarcoma virus. Both CSP and hemagglutinating activity are progressively adsorbed onto erythrocytes and can be released by 1 M urea. An antiserum to purified CSP specifically blocks the agglutination. The agglutinating activity is destroyed by boiling or treatment with proteases. The agglutination reaction is inhibited by the chelating agents EDTA and EGTA [ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid]. Agglutination is also inhibited to a lesser degres by amino sugars and other amines, increased osmolarity, and urea. Other monosaccharides, hyaluronidase, DNase, and RNase have little or not effect on the agglutination reaction. This demonstration that CSP has an agglutinating activity that is sensitive to proteases and that requires divalent cations suggests that this molecule may play a role in cell adhesion.Images	The major cell surface glycoprotein of chick embryo fibroblasts is an agglutinin.

A cell surface component has been isolated in partially purified form from cultured chick embryo and chick heart fibroblasts. This glycoprotein is similar to a protein recently reported to be present at the surface of normal cells, and missing after neoplastic transformation. It is a major cell surface glycoprotein that is synthesized by cultured fibroblasts, but is not collagen. It is shown to be markedly trypsin-sensitive, and its recovery from the cell surface is dependent on cell density. It is excluded from Sephadex G-200, but is not rapidly sedimented by ultracentrifugation, and has an apparent molecular weight of 220,000. The isolation of this cell surface glycoprotein may now provide a means of determining its function.Images	Isolation of a Major Cell Surface Glycoprotein from Fibroblasts	Kenneth M. Yamada, James A.

The enzyme lactoperoxidase (iodide:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.8) was used to iodinate (125I) accessible proteins on membranes of intact virally transformed and untransformed cells. A number of labeled bands of proteins were detected by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. A heavily labeled band with a molecular weight of approximately 250,000 daltons was found in all untransformed cells but was absent from transformed cells. When Coomassie-blue-stained membrane preparations were compared, a band was seen in normal cells which co-migrated with the lactoperoxidase-labeled band. In transformed cell membranes, three discrete bands were present in the same position. Thus, the expression of this protein may be altered when cells are in the transformed state.Images	A Comparison of Membrane Proteins of Normal and Transformed Cells by Lactoperoxidase Labeling	Nancy M.

"Fibroblast surface (SE) antigen is present in fibrillar surface structures of cultured normal fibroblasts, shed to the extracellular medium, and is also found in circulation (serum and plasma). Malignant fibroblasts (transformed by viruses) do not express SF antigen on the cell surface. In this study the in vivo differentiation and distribution of SF antigen has been investigated in the developing chick embryo using cryostat sections and immunofluorescence. The major findings were: (a) SF antigen was detectable in the loose connective tissue of very early (2-to 3-day old) embryos. (b) Condensation of SF antigen was seen in various boundary membranes such as the glomerular and tubular basement membranes of the kidney, the boundary membranes of the notochord, yolk sac, and vitelline membranes and liver sinusoids. (c) SF antigen was found to be cell-type specific. It was seen as a fibrillar network in the loose connective tissue of different organs but not in the parenchymal cells. It was not found in muscle cells at any stage of development. (d) The antigen was present in the undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the kidney; but not found after their development into epithelial cells of the secretory tubules. (e) Both in vivo and in fibroblast cultures SF antigen was distributed as a fibrillar network. These data indicate that SF antigen is a ""differentiation antigen"" restricted to certain cells of mesenchymal origin and character, and that is accumulates in the connective tissue during embryogenesis."

Fibronectin is a major surface-associated glycoprotein of cultured fibroblasts and it is also present in human plasma. Antiserum specific for human fibronectin was used to study the distribution of fibronectin in normal adult human tissues. The protein was detected (a) characteristically in various basement membranes including capillary walls: (b) around individual smooth muscle cells and in the sarcolemma of striated muscle fibers; and (c) in the stroma of lymphatic tissue and as thin fibers in loose connective tissue. The distribution of fibronectin was distinct from that of collagen and elastic fibers, but was very similar to reticulin, as demonstrated by conventional histological staining. The results indicate that fibronectin is a major component of connective tissue matrix. The distribution also indicates that most types of adherent cells abut fibronectin-containing structures. This supports the possible role of fibronectin in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in tissues.

The effect of the common lipid moiety of bacterial LPS on secretion from washed human platelets has been studied. The lipid A-rich LPS of S. minnesota R595 and a lipid A preparation both potentiated platelet serotonin secretion in response to IgG aggregates or immune complexes up to 50-fold but had little effect in the absence of IgG. Lipid A has been shown to bind immune aggregates, raising the possibility that its mechanism of action involved effective enlargement or insolubilization of the aggregates. IgG aggregates of dimer to tetramer size were shown to be platelet simuli, equivalent on a weight basis to larger soluble aggregates. The effect of both sizes of aggregates on platelets were equally enhanced by the LPS, indicating that increased size of aggregates alone could not account for the effect of LPS. Similarly, because lipid A-rich LPS enhanced platelet response to already insoluble immune complexes, its mechanism of action cannot simply be insolubilization of immune aggregates. These LPS did not enhance platelet stimulation by antiplatelet antibody, monosodium urate crystals, or thrombin and only slightly enhanced stimulation by insoluble human skin collagen. This indicates some stimulus specificity in the ability of LPS to increase platelet secretion. The enhancement of cell response to immune complexes by the common lipid region of LPS may represent a mechanism for the diverse effects of LPS in vivo and in vitro.

The glycoproteins of whole cells have been analyzed by direct application of radio-iodinated lectins to sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, followed by autoradiography. By use of lectins with different carbohydrate specificities, different sets of glycoproteins have been visualized. The most prominent lectin-binding band in many gels is thelarge, external, transformation-sensitive (LETS) protein. Major glycoprotein differences are revealed when normal and virus-transformed cells are compared. Certain differences, however, are also seen when the glycoproteins are compared from two separately derived simian virus 40 transformants of 3T3 cells, suggesting a degree of clonal variation between these lines that may not relate to transformation. A complementary technique is used to detect specific antigens in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels by direct application of iodinated antibodies. An antiserum specific for the LETS protein is used to identify this antigen in the gels of both normal and transformed cells.Images	Changes in cellular glycoproteins after transformation: identification of specific glycoproteins and antigens in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels.

Fibroblast surface antigen (SFA) is a high molecular weight protein antigen, first shown on the surface of cultured fibroblasts in fibrillar structures. It is shed to the extracellular medium and also present in the circulation (serum and plasma). Fibroblasts transformed by tumor viruses produce SFA but do not retain it on cell surface. In this report we show that SFA is also present in cultured nonestablished astroglial cells. The glial and fibroblast SFAs are immunologically indistinguishable. Glial cells (three different nonestablished lines) contain more SFA per milligram cellular protein than fibroblasts. SFA was located on cell surface in fibrillar striae that frequently extended out from the cell body. Fluorescence was also found intracellularly in the cytoplasm. Malignant gliomas (astrocytomas) established to grow in culture from human tumor material produced SFA into the growth medium but had very little (lines U-105 MG and U-343 MG) or no detectable (lines U-118 MG, U-251 MG, and U-343 MG-a) cell surface SFA. In cultures of the glioma cells many cells, in particular those that appeared to be in the telophase stage, stained strongly positive for intracellular cytoplasmic SFA. These data demonstrate that similar to fibroblasts transformed experimentally by oncogenic viruses, cells grown from naturally occurring human tumors (glioblastomas) produce SFA but lose ability to retain it on cell surface.

The distribution of a major fibroblast protein, fibronectin, was studied by immunofluorescence and immunoscanning electron microscopy in cultures of human and chicken fibroblasts during different phases of the cell cycle. The main findings were: (a) In interphase cells, the intensity of surface-associated fibronectin fluorescence correlated with that of intracellular fibronectin fluorescence. (b) The intensity of the fluorescence of both surface-associated and intracellular fibronectins was not changed in cells that were synthesizing DNA. (c) Mitotic cells had reduced amounts of surface-associated but not of intracellular fibronectin. The surface fibronectin that remained on meta-, ana-, or telophase cells had a distinct punctate distribution and was also localized to strands attaching the cells to the substratum. Fibronectin strands first reappeared on the surface of flattening cytoplasmic parts of telophase cells. (d) Fibronectin was also detected in extracellular fibrillar material on the growth substratum, particularly around dividing cells. Thus, surface-associated fibrillar fibronectin was present during G(1), S, and G(2) but in cells undergoing mitosis the distribution was altered and the amount appeared to be reduced. The observations on the distribution of surface-associated fibronectin suggest that rather than being involved in growth control this fibronectin plays a structural role in interactions of cells with the environment.

Antibodies to fibronectin and to distinct types of procollagens and collagens were used in immunofluorescent staining to localize these proteins in cell cultures. Normal human skin or lung fibroblasts produced a fibrillar pericellular matrix in which fibronectin and procollagen (types I and III) showed extensive codistribution. Fibronectin and procollagen were synthesized by the same cells as judged by double-stain immunofluorescence. Pericellular procollagen was specifically digested with collagenase without an effect on the fibrillar distribution of matrix fibronectin. Brief treatment with trypsin removed both matrix proteins. The human tumor cell lines HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma) and RD (rhabdomyosarcoma) produced little or no matrix fibronectin or procollagen. At sites of cell contact, simian virus 40-transformed lung fibroblasts (VA13) produced small amounts of pericellular fibrillar matrix fibronectin that codistributed with procollagen type I. Intracellular fibronectin and procollagen were visualized in all of these human sarcoma cell lines. When chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a T class mutant (NY68) of Rous sarcoma virus temperature-sensitive for transformation were maintained at the nonpermissive temperature (41°) the cells had normal phenotype and a fibrillar matrix containing fibronectin and procollagen was present. At the permissive temperature (35°), the cells showed transformed phenotype and the matrix was lost. The failure to produce a pericellular fibronectin/collagen matrix may account for several phenotypic characteristics of transformed cultured fibroblasts.Images	Codistribution of pericellular matrix proteins in cultured fibroblasts and loss in transformation: Fibronectin and procollagen	Antti Vaheri, Markku Kurkinen, Veli-Pekka Lehto, Ewert Linder, Rupert Timpl	217006	1978-10-01	4	
Collagen and/or procollagen was demonstrated on the surface of monolayers of fibroblasts from normal rat kidney by indirect immunofluorescence with affinity-purified antibodies to collagen. The protein was arrayed in a reticular fashion on the cell surface and, in cells attached to a substratum, was severely restricted in its ability to undergo antibody-induced translational movement in the plane of the membrane. A similar pattern was observed for fibronectin (LETS protein, fibroblast surface antigen). These macromolecules were lost when fibroblasts were dissociated and examined in suspension cultures and were not regained until after the cells were replated. On the basis of the morphological findings, and in view of the likelihood of an interaction between fibronectin and collagen, we propose that these that these proteins form a meshwork on the cell surface. This external protein meshwork may mediate a number of important cellular functions, including attachment to a substratum and other interactions with the extracellular matrix.Images	Cell surface-associated structural proteins in connective tissue cells.

A glycoprotein immunologically related to plasma cold-insoluble globulin (CIG) and fetal skin fibroblast fibronectin has been purified from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. This protein (amniotic fluid fibronectin) migrated more slowly than CIG on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and showed greater polydispersity which could result, at least in part, from heterogeneity in glycosylation. Cloned human amniotic fluid epithelioid and fibroblastic cells synthesized and secreted a protein with similar properties into the culture medium. Fibronectin was shown to be associated with the pericellular and extracellular matrix of cultured amniotic fluid cells by immunofluorescence, lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, and labeling with ferritin-conjugated antibodies. The kinetics of secretion of the protein were consistent with its role as a matrix protein. We anticipate that amniotic fluid fibronectin will prove to be the same protein which elsewhere in the body is incorporated into connective tissues and basement membranes. Amniotic fluid could, therefore, serve as a convenient source of in vivo synthesized fibronectin for biological and structural studies.	Amniotic fluid fibronectin.

"Cell surface proteins of cultured cells are disulfide bonded to a greater degree than are total cellular proteins. In particular, the ""large external transformation-sensitive"" (LETS) protein, a major surface protein, is present almost exclusively in disulfide-bonded complexes including homodimers and also higher aggregates held together by disulfide bonds or concovalent interactions. Other cell surface proteins also appear to be involved in disulfide bonding, both intramolecular and intermolecular. In virally transformed cells, LETS protein and its disulfide complexes are absent and certain other disulfide-bonded proteins are also not observed.Images"	Extensive disulfide bonding at the mammalian cell surface.

The organization of LETS protein on the surface of NIL8 hamster cells has been examined by immunofluorescence staining. The distribution of LETS protein was found to depend on the culture conditions; in subconfluent, low-serum arrested cultures the LETS protein is predominantly located at the cell-substrate interface and also in regions of cell-cell contact, whereas in dense cultures the cells are surrounded by a network of LETS protein fibrils. Transformed derivatives of these cells exhibit only sporadic staining for LETS protein, in the form of short intercellular bridges. Agents that cause alterations in cell shape and cytoplasmic filaments have been used to explore the relationship of LETS protein to the internal cytoskeletal elements. Reciprocally, perturbations of the cell surface were examined for their effects on internal filaments. The arrangement of microtubules seems to be unrelated to the presence of LETS protein in the cells studied. Actin microfilament bundles and LETS protein respond in a coordinate fashion to some perturbants but independently with respect to others. The patterns of staining for LETS protein are consistent with an involvement in cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate adhesion.

This communication explores the capacity of different proteases to stimulate DNA synthesis in resting chick embryo fibroblasts and to cause the removal of cell membrane proteins previosly postulated as important in the regulation of growth and division of cells. Thrombin, a highly specific protease and a known mitogen, was incubated with chick embryo fibroblasts, and analysis was made of the cell membrane proteins. Of particular interest were a protein of molecular weight 250,000, which is known to be readily removed by the action of trypsin and is not present in most transformed cells, and two other proteins, which are reduced in amount in transformed as compared to confluent resting cell cultures. None of these three proteins was removed by thrombin when the latter was added to confluent cells in concentrations sufficient to cause significant increase in DNA synthesis twelve hours after stimulation by the protease. The presence or absence of these proteins in the membranes of confluent resting or transformed cells of chick embryo fibroblasts does not seem to be directly related to the process of regulation of DNA synthesis and cellular division.Images	The role of surface proteins in cell proliferation as studied with thrombin and other proteases.

Fluorescence photobleaching recovery and immunofluorescence methods have been used to study the lateral mobility and topographical distribution of a major cell surface glycoprotein (CSP). Both endogenous CSP and fluorescent-labeled exogenous CSP bind to the cell surface in a fibrillar pattern and are immobile on the experimental time scale. Azide, vinblastine, and cytochalasin B do not alter the immobility and cell surface distribution of the CSP molecules. Therefore, oxidative phosphorylation and the cytoskeleton do not seem to be responsible for the properties of the bound glycoprotein. The presence of immobile CSP fibrils does not, however, impede the diffusion of a lipid probe, a ganglioside analogue, or various surface antigens. Therefore, the fibrils apparently do not form a “barrier” across the lipid phase of the plasma membrane. In contrast, concanavalin A binds to CSP and is largely immobile in regions rich in CSP. The presence of immobile concanavalin A receptors in areas or on cells lacking CSP indicates that other types of immobile concanavalin A receptors also exist.CSP does not bind to lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine or oxidized cholesterol. It does bind to dextran-coated bilayers as a diffuse distribution of mobile molecules that can patch after addition of antibodies to CSP. The latter result suggests that CSP molecules do not interact strongly with other CSP molecules under these conditions. Exogenous CSP binds to regions on the cell surface that already bear CSP. In view of the apparent weakness of CSP-CSP interactions on the lipid bilayer, it seems possible that the assembly of CSP fibrils is nucleated by cell surface components in addition to CSP.Images	Mobility and distribution of a cell surface glycoprotein and its interaction with other membrane components	J.

1. Eight distinct acid-hydrolase activities present in cytoplasmic extracts from bone tissue occur in latent form to the extent of 50–70% of their total activity, depending on the enzyme. 2. This latency can be decreased or suppressed by exposure to Triton X-100 or to media of low osmotic pressure, by treatment in the Waring Blendor, and by freezing and thawing, but not by increasing the substrate concentration in the assay medium up to 10-fold the Michaelis constant of the enzymes. 3. Latency is the property of the particle-bound enzymes, and treatments that suppress latency simultaneously cause solubilization of the enzymes. Most enzymes show an excess of free over soluble activity; the magnitude of this excess seems to depend largely on the nature of the enzyme, and sometimes also on the kind of treatment suffered by the preparations; it is attributed mainly to adsorption artifacts. 4. In preparations subjected to graded activating treatments, seven of the eight acid hydrolases studied are released in closely parallel fashion, suggesting that they are associated with particles possessing similar properties. Acid phenylphosphatase is released less readily than the other enzymes by Triton X-100 and by exposure to media of low osmotic pressure. 5. It is concluded from these and previous published fractionation experiments that, with the possible exception of part of the acid-phenylphosphatase activity, the eight acid hydrolases studied belong to lysosome-like particles. Bone lysosomes exhibit a relatively high degree of biochemical and physical heterogeneity. Their possible functions are discussed. Part of the acid-phenylphosphatase activity could be linked to another group of particles. 6. Catalase is also partly (30%) latent in cytoplasmic extracts of bone. Latent catalase can be released by some of the treatments that suppress the latency of the lysosomal enzymes, but differs from the latter by a greater resistance to Triton X-100, and, especially, by a complete insensitivity to exposure to media of low osmotic pressure. It is concluded from these results that the catalase-containing particles are probably different from lysosomes, as they are in liver. 7. Cytochrome oxidase, which is presumably associated with the mitochondria, and alkaline phenylphosphatase, an enzyme occurring predominantly in the microsomal fraction, exhibited no latency under the conditions of the present experiments.

1. Nine acid hydrolases, cytochrome oxidase, alkaline phenylphosphatase and catalase were demonstrated in 0·25m-sucrose homogenates of newborn-rat calvaria. The acid hydrolases were: acid phenylphosphatase, acid β-glycerophosphatase, β-glucuronidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (β-N-acetylaminodeoxyglucosidase), acid ribonuclease and acid deoxyribonuclease, showing optimum activity at about pH5; cathepsin, β-galactosidase and hyaluronidase, with optimum activity at about pH3·6. 2. The main kinetic characters of these enzymes have been studied and methods for their quantitative assay have been worked out. The activities present in bone are given and compared with those found in liver. 3. Acid-phosphatase activity was assayed with phenyl phosphate and β-glycerophosphate as substrates: activities with these two substrates appeared to be due to two different enzymes. Acid phenylphosphatase is particularly labile and is readily inactivated by various physical or chemical agents.	Studies on bone enzymes.

In the filamentous blue-green alga Anabaena 7120, aerobic nitrogen fixation is linked to the differentiation of specialized cells called heterocysts. In order to study control of heterocyst development and nitrogen fixation in Anabaena, we have used cloned fragments of the Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogen fixation (nif) genes as probes in DNA·DNA hybridizations with restriction endonuclease fragments of Anabaena DNA. Using this technique, we were able to identify and clone Anabaena nif genes, demonstrating the feasibility of using heterologous probes to identify genes for which no traditional genetic selection exists. From the patterns of hybridization observed, we deduced that although DNA sequence homology has been retained between some of the nif genes of these divergent organisms, the nif gene order has been rearranged.Images	Identification of blue-green algal nitrogen fixation genes by using heterologous DNA hybridization probes	Barbara J.

Cloned nitrogen fixation (nif) genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae hybridize to DNA from 19 out of 19 widely divergent nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains but do not hybridize to DNA from 10 different non-nitrogen-fixing species. K. pneumoniae nif DNA fragments that hybridize to DNA from other species contain part of the three structural genes that code for nitrogenase polypeptides. We have utilized this homology to clone an EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragment from Rhizobium meliloti that hybridizes to the K. pneumoniae nif structural genes. Some of the species whose DNA hybridizes with K. pneumoniae nif DNA have been postulated to have diverged from K. pneumoniae 3 x 10(9) years ago. Nitrogenase genes are the only known example of such highly conserved prokaryotic translated genes. Nitrogenase genes are either extraordinarily conserved in evolution or have been exchanged between different nitrogen-fixing species relatively recently in evolutionary time.Images	Interspecies homology of nitrogenase genes.

Cleared lysates of 13 species of filamentous cyanobacteria were examined for the presence of extrachromosomal DNA by using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Seven of the 13 species contained extrachromosomal covalently closed circular DNA, and all but 1 species contained multiple elements. There was no correlation between the presence of extrachomosomal DNA and either the range of metabolic activities found in the cyanobacteria or the differentiated cell types or structures elaborated by the morphologically complex filamentous cyanobacteria.Images	Survey of extrachromosomal DNA found in the filamentous cyanobacteria.

The cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum (IU 594-UTEX 594) fixes N2 only in the absence of combined N and of O2. We induced nitrogenase by transfer to anaerobic N-free medium and studied the effect of Mo starvation on nitrogenase activity and synthesis. Activity was first detected within 3 h after transfer by the acetylene reduction assay in controls, increasing for at least 25 h. Cells grown on nitrate and Mo and then transferred to N-free, Mo-free medium produced 8% of the control nitrogenase activity. Addition of W to the Mo-free medium reduced the activity to 0.5%. Under both Mo starvation conditions, nitrogenase protein components were synthesized. Component II of the cyanobacterial enzyme was detected by in vitro complementation with Mo-containing component I from Klebsiella pneumoniae or Azotobacter vinelandii but not Clostridium pasteurianum. Component I activity was restored by addition of Mo to cultures in which new enzyme synthesis was blocked by chloramphenicol. Acidified extracts of Plectonema induced in Mo-containing medium contained the Fe-Mo cofactor required to activate extracts of the Azotobacter mutant UW45 in vitro, but they did not activate extracts of Mo-starved Plectonema. Analysis of 35SO4(2-)-labeled proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that Mo is required for the conversion of a high-molecular-weight precursor to component I in Plectonema.Images	Molybdenum independence of nitrogenase component synthesis in the non-heterocystous cyanobacterium Plectonema.

We describe a method for the rapid determination of the physical location of mutations caused by insertion of transposable elements. We used this method to construct a detailed physical map of the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster of Klebsiella pneumoniae and to correlate it with the genetic map. Total cellular DNA was isolated from individual strains, each carrying an insertion in 1 of 15 different nif genes. The DNA was digested with a restriction endonuclease, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, denatured, and blotted onto nitrocellulose filter paper. The DNA on the filters was hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA fragments derived from amplifiable plasmids carrying cloned nif DNA fragments from K. pneumoniae. Altered hybridization patterns caused by insertions into nif genes allowed us to map nif mutations with respect to the previously mapped cleavage sites for various restriction endonucleases. We have used the same method to map the end points of nif deletions. Using this procedure, we assigned physical locations on the K. pneumoniae chromosome to 86 nif insertion mutations and 13 nif deletion end points. This mapping procedure provides a convenient alternative to deletion mapping as a definitive method for mapping insertion mutations within a gene or for ordering genes within a gene cluster. This procedure will be especially useful for mapping mutations conferring phenotypes that are difficult to monitor and for mapping mutations in bacterial species in which techniques for conducting deletion mapping have not been devised.Images	Physical map of chromosomal nitrogen fixation (nif) genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae	Gerard E.

Two hundred and thirty-five Nif- strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were characterized by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Forty-two of these strains were tested further by in vitro acetylene reduction assays. By these techniques, nine nif-coded polypeptides were identified, and eight of these were assigned to specific nif genes. Nitrogenase component I required nifK and nifD, which coded for the beta and alpha subunits, and nifB, -E, and -N were required for the iron-molybdenum cofactor, which is a part of the active site of nitrogenase. nifH coded for the structural protein of component II, and nifM and nifS products seemed to be necessary for the synthesis of an active component II. There were two genes, nifF and nifJ, that were required for N2 fixation in vivo but not for N2 fixation in vitro. There were at least two cases (nifE and nifN, nifK and nifD) of two proteins that seemed to require each other for stability in vivo. Regulation of N2 fixation is apparently complex, and this is reflected by the assignment of regulatory functions to the gene products of nifA, nifL, nifK, nifD, nifH, and NIFJ.Images	Regulation and characterization of protein products coded by the nif (nitrogen fixation) genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Four hundred and eighty-nine independent Nif- strains containing 260 point, 130 millimicron-induced, and 99 deletion mutations in nif in the Klebsiella pneumoniae chromosome were isolated. Three hundred and ninety insertion and point mutations were mapped with millimicron-induced deletions carried on 44 plasmids derived from pTM4010, a recombinant R factor containing the his-nif region of K. pneumoniae. The 99 chromosomal deletions in the nif region were mapped with 69 derivatives of pTM4010 carrying insertion and point mutations in nif. Complementation analysis between 84 derivatives of pTM4010 carrying nif mutations and Rec- derivatives of the 390 Nif- mutants identified 14 genes. The nif mutations were ordered into 49 deletion groups with a gene order of his...nifQBALFMVSNEKDHJ. Complementation analysis of millimicron-induced, amber, frameshift, and deletion mutations indicates there are five polycistronic and two monocistronic operons: nifQ nifB, nifA nifL, nifF, nifM nifV nifS, nifN nifE, nifK nifD nifH, and nifJ.

Mutations causing constitutive synthesis of glutamine synthetase (GlnC− phenotype) were transferred from Klebsiella aerogenes into Klebsiella pneumoniae by P1-mediated transduction. Such GlnC− strains of K. pneumoniae have constitutive levels of glutamine synthetase. Two of three GlnC− strains of K. pneumoniae studied, each containing independently isolated mutations that confer the GlnC− phenotype, continue to synthesize nitrogenase in the presence of NH4+. One strain, KP5069, produces 30% as much nitrogenase when grown in the presence of 15 mM NH4+ as in its absence. The GlnC− phenotype allows the synthesis of nitrogenase to continue under conditions that completely repress nitrogenase synthesis in the wild-type strain. Glutamine auxotrophs of K. pneumoniae, that do not produce catalytically active glutamine synthetase, are unable to synthesize nitrogenase during nitrogen limited growth. Complementation of K. pneumoniae Gln− strains by an Escherichia coli episome (F′133) simultaneously restores glutamine synthetase activity and the ability to synthesize nitrogenase. These results indicate a role for glutamine synthetase as a positive control element for nitrogen fixation in K. pneumoniae.

Selected mutant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae that are unable to fix nitrogen have been characterized according to nitrogenase component activity as well as antigenic cross-reacting material. The lesions in these strains have been mapped by transduction, and the results indicate that there are at least five genes specifically responsible for nitrogen fixation in vivo. Besides genes that specify the structure of the two nitrogenase components, there is a gene for a factor that is required for component I activity and a gene that codes for a factor possibly involved in electron transport to component II. A mutation in another site does not allow the organism to produce either of the nitrogenase components. All of these genes are co-transducible with the gene that specifics the structure of histidinol dehydrogenase.	Biochemistry and genetics of Klebsiella pneumoniae mutant strains unable to fix N2.

Transformation of E. coli cells treated with CaCl2 to multiple antibiotic resistance by purified R-factor DNA is reported. Drug resistance is expressed in a small fraction of the recipient bacterial population almost immediately after uptake of DNA, but full genetic expression of resistance requires subsequent incubation in drugfree medium before antibiotic challenge. Transformed bacteria acquire a closed circular, transferable DNA species having the resistance, fertility, and sedimentation characteristics of the parent R factor. Covalently-closed, catenated, and open (nicked) circular forms of R-factor DNA are all effective in transformation, but denaturation and sonication abolish the transforming ability of R-factor DNA in this system.

The 23S twisted circular form of ColE1 DNA has been isolated from Escherichia coli as a tightly associated DNA-protein complex with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 24S. Treatment of this complex with pronase, trypsin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, Sarkosyl, or heat results in a conversion to a slower sedimenting form of 17S or 18S, as determined by centrifugation in neutral sucrose gradients. These treatments do not alter the sedimentation properties of noncomplexes supercoiled ColE1 DNA even in the presence of the ColE1-protein complex. Electron microscopic analyses indicate that the decrease in sedimentation rate of the ColE1-protein complex after treatment with these various agents is largely owing to an induced transition of ColE1 DNA from the supercoiled to the open circular state.Images	SUPERCOILED CIRCULAR DNA-PROTEIN COMPLEX IN Escherichia coli: PURIFICATION AND INDUCED CONVERSION TO AN OPEN CIRCULAR DNA FORM*	Don B.

The promoter/operator/leader region of the trp operon of Shigella dysenteriae 16 has single base pair differences from the corresponding region of Escherichia coli at positions -24 and -13. The difference at -13 was shown to be responsible for the 90% reduction in promoter function characteristic of the trp operon of S. dysenteriae. The base pair difference at position -13 also renders the operator partially constitutive. This allows the organism to maintain relatively high repressed levels of the trp enzymes and increases the relative importance of attenuation as a transcription control mechanism. These findings and the earlier observation that the trpE protein of S. dysenteriae is only slightly active explain the low in vivo expression of the trp operon of this organism. Nutritional studies suggest that operons involved in other amino acid biosynthetic pathways in S. dysenteriae 16 may be similarly partially inactivated.Images	Naturally occurring promoter down mutation: nucleotide sequence of the trp promoter/operator/leader region of Shigella dysenteriae 16.

the mutation that causes ribonuclease III (RNase III) deficiency in strain AB301-105 of Kindler et al. (1973) has been mapped by use of F' merodiploids, Hfr matings, and P1 transduction. This mutation, rnc-105, lies close to nadB, near 49 min on the genetic map of Escherichia coli. The rnc-105 mutation has been transferred from its original genetic background by transduction and conjugation, and these new strains have the same defects in ribonucleic acid processing reported previously for AB301-105. Strains that carry rnc-105 grow more slowly than parental rnc+ strains, but the difference in growth rate seems to depend on the genetic background of each strain. Bacteriophage T7 grows about equally well in RNase III+ and III- female strains of E. coli, even though the specific cuts that RNase III makes in T7 ribonucleic acid are not made in the RNase III- strains. A low-phosphate defined medium in which most E. coli strains seem to grow well was developed. This medium is equally useful for labeling ribonucleic acids with 32PO4 and as a selective medium for genetic manipulations. It was used to determine the growth requirements of strain AB301-105, which are biotin and succinate in addition to the methionine and histidine requirements of the parental strain. The biotin mutation lies near the position expected from known mutations of E. coli, but the succinate mutation apparently does not. The possibility that the succinate requirement could be due to the RNase III deficiency is discussed. A uraP mutation was isolated for use in transferring rnc-105 between strains by conjugation.

Closed-circular, superhelical DNA from simian virus 40 (SV40 DNA I) was treated with an excess of DNA-relaxing enzyme in the presence of increasing amounts of ethidium bromide (EtdBr). After removal of the ethidium, each sample consisted of a group of close-circular DNA molecules differing in their number of superhelical turns (tau) around a mean value of tau in a Gaussian-like distribution. The DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose gels under conditions where the electrophoretic mobility was a function of the number of superhelical turns. Since the distributions around tau of DNA molecules of different samples overlappped, the difference in the mean number of superhelical turns from sample to sample, delta tau, could be determined and used to measure the mean number (tau) for native SV40 DNA I. By this criterion, SV40 DNA I contains a Gaussian-like distribution of molecules differing by integral numbers around a mean value of tau = -24 +/- 2 at 37 degree C [in 0.2 M NaC1, 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.9), and 0.2 mM EDTA]. The heterogeneity in tau is probably a consequence of thermal fluctuations in the DNA helix at the time when the last phospholiester bond is closed in vivo. When correlated to the buoyant shift of completely relaxed SV40 DNA in a CsC1-propidium diiodide gradient, the number of delta tau = 24 +/- 2 of superhelical versus relaxed DNA implies an unwinding of the DNA helix by 26-28 degree upon intercalation of one molecule of EtdBr.Images	Determination of the number of superhelical turns in simian virus 40 DNA by gel electrophoresis.

Agarose gel electrophoresis may be employed effectively for the detection and preliminary characterization of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in clinical isolates and laboratory strains of gram-negative microorganisms. The method is sensitive and does not require radioisotopes or ultracentrifugation. The estimation of plasmid mass from the extent of DNA migration in gels compares favorably with results obtained by electron microscopy of plasmid DNA purified by equilibrium density centrifugation. The method has proved to be a useful tool for survey work and the epidemiological investigation of plasmid dissemination, as well as an important adjunct to the genetic analysis of plasmids.Images	Simple agarose gel electrophoretic method for the identification and characterization of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid.

Intact cells and extracts from Spirillum lipoferum rapidly oxidized malate, succinate, lactate, and pyruvate. Glucose, galactose, fructose, acetate, and citrate did not increase the rate of O2 uptake by cells above the endogenous rate. Cells grown on NH+/4 oxidized the various substrates at about the same rate as did cells grown on N2. Added oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide generally enhanced O2 uptake by extracts supplied organic acids, whereas oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate had little effect. Nitrogenase synthesis repressed by growth of cells in the presence of NH+/4 was derepressed by methionine sulfoximine or methionine sulfone. The total glutamine synthetase activity from N2-grown cells was about eight times that from NH+/4-grown S. lipoferum; the response of glutamate dehydrogenase was the opposite. The total glutamate synthetase activity from N2-grown S. lipoferum was 1.4 to 2.6 times that from NH+/4-grown cells. The levels of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were elevated in cells grown on N2 as compared with those grown on NH+/4. Cell-free extracts capable of reducing C2H2 have been prepared; both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are required for good activity.	Carbon and ammonia metabolism of Spirillum lipoferum.

"Twelve TnA insertions of ColE1 deoxyribonucleic acid have been isolated and mapped by electron microscopic studies of heteroduplex molecules. Insertions only blocking the production of active colicin clustered in one region of the map, whereas insertions only blocking the expression of deoxyribonucleic acid nicking activity associated with the plasmid ""relaxation complex"" clustered in another region of the map. The location of one insertion that blocks both the expression of colicin immunity and the production of active colicin suggests that the expression of both characteristics are coordinately controlled.Images"	Isolation, mapping, and examination of effects of TnA insertions in ColE1 plasmids.

A cleavage map of a recombinant plasmid carrying Tn10 was constructed for 13 different restriction enzymes. The Tn10 region of this plasmid contains cleavage sites for BamHI, AvaI, BglI, BglII, EcoRI, XbaI, HincII, HindIII, and HpaI. Restriction enzymes PstI, SmaI, KpnI, XhoI, SalI, and PvuI do not cleave within the Tn10 element. This map confirms the previously reported structure of this transposon; it is composed of a unique sequence (approximately6,400 base pairs long), which in part codes for the tetracycline resistance functions and is bounded by inverted repeats (approximately 1,450 base pairs long).

The bacteriophage P1 infects and functions as a generalized transducing phage for nitrogen-fixing strains of the coliform bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacterial mutants (nif-) unable to grow on molecular nitrogen as a nitrogen source were found to be deficient in nitrogenase activity as assayed by the conversion of acetylene to ethylene. These mutants regained normal nitrogenase activity and the ability to grow on N2 after transduction with lysates of P1 phage prepared from wild-type bacteria. Transductional analysis with P1 revealed that several nif genes are located on the genetic linkage map of Klebsiella near the histidine operon.Images	Transduction of the Nitrogen-Fixation Genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae	Stanley Streicher, Elizabeth Gurney, Raymond C.

A method for the isolation of an iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoCo) from component I of nitrogenase is described. This method is used to isolate FeMoCo from aerobic, anaerobic, facultative, and photosynthetic nitrogen-fixing organisms. The Fe/Mo ratio in the FeMoCo from Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum is 8:1. The FeMoCo contains six atoms of acid-labile sulfide per eight Fe atoms. Crystalline component I from A. vinelandii contains 2 Mo, 33 Fe, and 27 acid-labile sulfide atoms per molecular weight of 250,000. The specific activity of FeMoCo is 425 nmol of C2H4 formed/min per nmol of Mo. There is better than 98% reconstitution between FeMoCo and inactive component I in A. vinelandii mutant strain UW45. The FeMoCo yield from component I is about 90%. FeMoCo from nitrogenase component I of C. pasteurianum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus polymyxa, and Rhodospirillum rubrum activates inactive component I in an extract from mutant strain UW45 and follows saturation kinetics. The FeMoCo in various nitrogen-fixing organisms seems to be very similar. Wild-type A. vinelandii derepressed for nitrogenase synthesis in tungsten-containing medium and K. pneumoniae mutant strain UN109 are also activated in vitro by FeMoCo.The FeMoCo is very sensitive to oxygen, but is stable even at room temperature as long as it is kept anaerobic and in N-methylformamide, the solvent used for its isolation. FeMoCo is unstable in an aqueous environment, even though it is kept strictly anaerobic. Knowledge of the structure of this cofactor should be useful for understanding the role of molybdenum at the active site of nitrogenase, role of ligands close to molybdenum in electron and proton transfer, and the catalytic mechanism of nitrogen fixation. The FeMoCo might be used as a model for synthesizing catalysts for chemical nitrogen fixation.	Isolation of an iron-molybdenum cofactor from nitrogenase*	Vinod K. Shah, Winston J.

Five plasmids with insertions of a heat-inducible Mu prophage in a Mu-sensitive and P1-sensitive derivative of plasmid pRD1, a recombinant R factor containing the his-nif region of Klebsiella pneumoniae, were isolated and characterized. In one plasmid containing the Mu prophage integrated at the his-distal end of nif, selection for heat resistance resulted in the generation of deletions extending from the Mu prophage into the nif region. Thirty of these deltions were used to map 26 point mutations in nif.	Bacteriophage mu-induced deletions in a plasmid containing the nif (N2 fixation) genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Events underlying derepression of the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae M5A1 were analyzed in vivo by comparing the effects of selective inhibitors of transcription and translation on subsequent nitrogenase activity (rate of acetylene reduction). When batch cultures were induced for derepression, an 87-min lag separated ammonium ion/oxygen removal and the appearance of activity. To prevent eventual activity by adding inhibitors during this period, it was found necessary to add rifampin, ammonium ion, or chloramphenicol more than 50, 20, or 10 min, respectively, before activity appeared in a parallel control. When these inhibitors were added to cultures in which nitrogenase activity had already appeared, further increase in activity was not stopped by rifampin or ammonium ion until 45 or 20 min, respectively, after addition. Chloramphenicol stopped further increase in nitrogenase activity almost immediately. These data indicated a nif operon whose transcription/translation consumes 40 min. When the kinetics of β-galactosidase induction were analyzed under similar conditions, it was found that 7 min separated the initiation of transcription and the first completions of translation. Extrapolating from this, we find the nif operon to occupy 17 average gene lengths. It is argued that the nif structural genes in K. pneumoniae are contained on one operon, and further, that the disparity between the kinetics of inhibition by rifampin and those by ammonium ion suggests regulation at a locus other than the operator.

6-Cyanopurine (6-CP) can be used as a color indicator for certain classes of nif (N2 fixation) mutations in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Under N2-fixing conditions, Nif+ colonies and most Nif- colonies are purple on media containing 6-CP. Twenty-two Nif- mutants with altered color on medium containing 6-CP were isolated. All white mutants contained mutations in the regulatory genes, nifAA-nifL. Mutants which were more darkly colored than the wild type had mutations distributed among six nif genes. Medium with 6-CP was used to isolate Nif- mutants with deletions internal to the nif genes, and 6-CP was used to identify strains depressed for nitrogenase synthesis in the presence of NH4+.	6-cyanopurine, a color indicator useful for isolating mutations in the nif (nitrogen fixation) genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 is naturally resistant to infection by bacteriophage Mu. Mutants of K. pneumoniae sensitive to Mu infection were isolated and found to support both lytic and lysogenic development of Mu. K. pneumoniae lysogens containing a heat-inducible Mu prophage integrated in his were isolated. Strains carrying deletions extending from his into nif were obtained after heat treatment of these lysogens. Such deletions should be useful for determining the map order and cistronic organization of the nif genes.	Use of bacteriophage Mu to isolate deletions in the his-nif region of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The nitrogen-fixing bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae M5al is not sensitive to infection by bacteriophage Mu. A mutant of K. pneumoniae that is sensitive to Mu infection was isolated. Several Mu-induced auxotrophic mutations of K. pneumoniae including nif, trp, and rtl were isolated and genetically characterized. Evidence is presented that the Mu-induced mutations of nif arise as the result of insertion of Mu within (or near) the nif operon(s). The rtl locus, which determines the ability to utilize ribitol as a carbon source, was found to be linked to nif loci.

Several diaminopimelic acid (DAP)- and lysine-requiring mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated and studied by genetic, physiological, and biochemical means. The genes concerned with DAP-lysine synthesis map at several different sites on the E. coli chromosome and, therefore, do not constitute a single operon. Three separate loci affecting DAP synthesis are located in the 0 to 2.5 min region of the genetic map. The order of the loci in this region is thr-dapB-pyrA-ara-leu-pan-dapC-tonA-dapD. Two additional DAP genes map in the region between min 47 and 48, with the gene order being gua-dapA-dapE-ctr. The lys locus at min 55 determines the synthesis of the enzyme DAP decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of DAP into lysine. The order of the genes in this region is serA-lysA-thyA.

The lac genes were fused to the ara promoter by means of phage phi 80 translocations of the lac and ara genes to att80. Homology for a crossover between the nonhomologous ara and lac operons was provided by mu insertions. Selection for recombinants within the mu insertions generated strains that had the ara promoter on one side of a mu insertion and the lac genes on the other side. ara-lac fusions were obtained from these strains by deleting the mu insertion. These fusions extend the techniques available for studies on the lac operon to studies on the ara operon. It should be possible to fuse other operons by this method.

Rare conjugational progeny formed by crossing each of five Hfr strains with a recA-F- strain have been characterized. Selection was made for a proximal Hfr marker, taking strict precautions to prevent transfer of recA+ to the zygotes. Most of the progeny were found to be F' strains containing deletion mutant plasmids. With two exceptions, these mutant plasmids have lost all of the tra genes, which are required to confer conjugational donor ability upon a host. In addition, all but the exceptional mutant plasmids were found to be very poorly transmissible from transient heterozygotes which also contain a wild-type F' plasmid. The poor transmissibility is a cis-dominant transfer-defective phenotype which may result from deletion of all or part of the origin of transfer replication (ori), or of a gene determining a cis-acting protein. The two exceptional mutant plasmids may carry short deletions of some of the tra genes or polar tra mutations. The remaining progeny were nonmutant F' strains and F- strains. The frequency with which the F- strains were recovered permits us to estimate that the maximum amount of recombination possible in a recA56 zygote is 10(-6) that of a recA+ zygote.	cis-Dominant, transfer-deficient mutants of the Escherichia coli K-12 F sex factor.

It is shown here that distamycin A and actinomycin D can protect the recognition sites of endo R.EcoRI, EcoRII, HindII, HindIII, HpaI and HpaII from the attack of these restriction endonucleases. At proper distamycin concentrations only two endo R.EcoRI sites of phage lambda DNA are available for the restriction enzyme--sRI1 and sRI4. This phenomenon results in the appearance of larger DNA fragments comprising several consecutive fragments of endo R.EcoRI complete cleavage. The distamycin fragments isolated from the agarose gels can be subsequently cleaved by endo R.EcoRI with the yield of the fragments of complete digestion. We have compared the effect of distamycin A and actinomycin D on a number of restriction endonucleases having different nucleotide sequences in the recognition sites and established that antibiotic action depends on the nucleotide sequences of the recognition sites and their closest environmentImages	Protection of particular cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases by distamycin A and actinomycin D.

The colicinogenic factor E1 (Col E1) in Escherichia coli continues to replicate by a semiconservative mechanism in the presence of chloramphenicol (CAP) for 10 to 15 hr, long after chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis has terminated. Following CAP addition, the rate of synthesis of plasmid DNA gradually increases to an extent dependent on the medium employed. Within 2 to 4 hr after the addition of CAP, replication in a glucose-Casamino Acids medium approaches a maximum rate representing approximately eight times an average rate which would be required for a net doubling of DNA per cell in one generation. The number of copies of Col E1 DNA molecules that accumulate under these conditions approaches about 3,000 copies per cell, representing a 125-fold increase over the normal level of 24 copies per cell. The system is particularly convenient for studying the mechanism of DNA replication.Images	Nature of Col E1 Plasmid Replication in Escherichia coli in the Presence of Chloramphenicol	Don B.

The closed-circular DNA molecules of 85 × 106 daltons from Zea mays chloroplasts were isolated, digested with the restriction endonucleases Sal I, Bam I, and EcoRI, and the resulting fragments sized by agarose gel electrophoresis. A map of maize chloroplast DNA showing the relative location of all the Sal I recognition sequences and many of the Bam I and EcoRI recognition sites was determined. A DNA sequence representing approximately 15% of the Zea mays chloroplast genome is repeated. The two copies of this sequence are in an inverted orientation with respect to one another and are separated by a nonhomologous sequence representing approximately 10% of the genome length. The inverted repeats contain the genes for chloroplast ribosomal RNAs.Images	Endonuclease recognition sites mapped on Zea mays chloroplast DNA	John R.

A method has been developed to isolate mutants sensitive to coliphage P1 from bacterial genera normally not sensitive to this phage. P1clr100KM was used. This phage is heat inducible and confers kanamycin resistance when present as a prophage (in lysogens). P1-sensitive mutants of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Erwinia have been found. This technique provides a well-known genetic system for the study of many bacterial genera that previously had either no such system or only a marginally useful means of genetic manipulation. It also extends the range of possible intergeneric hybrids that may be constructed and studied.	Direct Selection for P1-Sensitive Mutants of Enteric Bacteria	Richard B. Goldberg, Robert A.

"The relationships between six of the seven allotypes or families of allotypes (a, b, c, d, f, g) described in the preceding paper, have been studied from the standpoints of (1) their antigenic specificities, (2) their mutual influence on the limitation of their respective frequencies, and (3) their genetic control. Although the six different allotypes (or families) react quite differently with the rabbit antisera, at least five of them react identically with a guinea pig antiserum. Therefore, a large portion of the antigenic specificity of these allotypes, distinct from their allotypic specificity, is uniform in all the individuals of the rabbit species and is termed for this reason ""isotypic specificity."" In the early period of the rabbit's life, allotypes may be found in the serum, which are not determined by the genotype of the individual, but are directly transmitted by the mother. The allotypes of the antigenic species of globulin studied in this paper, which were synthesized by the young animal, did not appear in its serum before a certain period of time. Allelic relationships between the genes which control allotypes were indicated by, (1) the absence of certain kinds of groupings of the allotypes, which limits the number of allotypic formulas in the population sample studied, (2) dosage effects, the concentration of certain allotypes (drawn from the penetration of the zones in gel tubes) being smaller in supposed heterozygotes than in supposed homozygotes, (3) the results of the analysis of the sera of a number of rabbits and of their parents. Eight of the different antigenic substances studied in this paper (allotype e excluded) appear to be allotypic forms of what would have been considered to be a uniform protein antigen. They may be classified as follows: a first group which contains two allotypes b and d and a family of two allotypes c and c' apparently controlled by three allelic genes b c d, c and c' being controlled by the same gene; a second group which contains two allotypes a and f and a family g, g' apparently controlled by three allelic genes a f g.

The antigenic properties of the polypeptide chains of human 7S γ-globulin have been related to two major non-cross-reacting antigenic determinants of the whole molecule. These determinants, called S and F, were obtained by hydrolysis of γ-globulin with papain. Antisera against whole γ-globulin and against S and F fragments were used in techniques of immune diffusion. Light (L) chains of γ-globulin showed reactions of partial identity with S fragments, and thus are antigenically deficient with respect to these fragments. Antisera directed against F determinants did not react with L chains but did react with heavy (H) polypeptide chain preparations. In addition, the major component of H chain fractions did not appear to contain determinants in common with the S fragments. L chains of a γ-myeloma protein were shown to be antigenically deficient with respect to the whole myeloma molecule, and antigenically identical with the Bence-Jones protein of the same patient. Correlation of these results with those of previous investigations have led to the conclusions that the S fragment which is known to contain the combining region of antibody molecules, consists in part of L chains or portions of L chains, and that the F fragment, which mediates several other functions of the whole molecule, is composed in part of portions of H chains.

L polypeptide chains of myeloma globulin and Bence-Jones protein isolated from the same patient were found to be identical after comparison of their tryptic hydrolysates by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis. The patterns of peptides from proteins belonging to antigenic group I differed markedly from those of proteins in antigenic group II. A partially purified H chain fraction was compared with L chains from the same myeloma protein. The tryptic hydrolysates yielded dissimilar patterns of peptides. These data indicate that γ-myeloma proteins contain two kinds of polypeptide chains, Hγ chains and either LI or LII chains. The L chains appear to be identical with those comprising the Bence-Jones protein from the same patient.

Additional evidence has been obtained to show that different guinea pig anti-hapten antibodies differ in the structure of their L polypeptide chains. Antibodies from animals immunized with the same hapten conjugated to different carrier proteins gave similar starch gel electrophoretic patterns after dissociation of their chains. In a study of fine differences of specificity, cross-reacting antibodies were found to have some L chains with the same electrophoretic mobility. The multiplicity of L chain bands found in the characteristic starch gel electrophoretic patterns of dissociated anti-DNP antibodies was shown to be a reflection of the heterogeneity of antibodies of slightly different specificities. Reduction and alkylation of the active fragment produced by digestion of antibodies with papain yielded starch gel electrophoretic bands corresponding in mobility to L chains. The results are consistent with the notion that L chains are involved in the acquisition of immunologic specificity.	STRUCTURE AND SPECIFICITY OF GUINEA PIG 7S ANTIBODIES	G. M. Edelman, B.

Two R factors, one (R15) conferring resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide (SMrSUr) and the other (222/R3) to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and chloramphenicol (SMrSUrCMr), were transferred to a Proteus mirabilis strain, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from these strains was subjected to density-gradient centrifugation. R15-DNA formed a single satellite band at a density of 1.709 g cm−3. Electron microscopy of samples from this band showed circular molecules of one type, with a contour length of 18 μm (35 × 106 daltons). 222/R3-DNA formed a satellite band with three peaks at densities 1.708, 1.711 and 1.717 g cm−3. Electron micrographs revealed circular structures from each band with contour lengths, respectively, of 29 (54 × 106 daltons), 36 (68 × 106 daltons), and 6 μm (12 × 106 daltons). “Supertwisted” forms of several molecular species were found. It is suggested that 222/R3 DNA comprises either a single 36-μm molecule or two individual molecules, 29 and 6 μm in length, and that this may reflect the evolutionary development of R factors.Images	Composite Circular Forms of R Factor Deoxyribonucleic Acid Molecules	Taizo Nisioka, Michiko Mitani, Royston Clowes	5764338	1969-01-01	9	
The molecular nature of R-factor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was examined in Escherichia coli by using a method for the specific labeling of the derepressed R factor, R1, in a female cell after conjugation. Sixty minutes after mating, the R factor was isolated as a single molecule with a molecular weight of 65 × 106 daltons. This single molecular species sedimented as either a covalently closed molecule or a “nicked” circle. When the single R-factor component was centrifuged in a CsCl density gradient, only a single homogeneous species with a buoyant density of 1.711 g/cm3 was observed. R-factor DNA was also isolated directly from exponentially growing cells of E. coli as a covalently closed single molecular species comprising about 1% of the total cellular DNA. Previous studies in Proteus show that R1 factor DNA components of buoyant density 1.709, 1.711, and 1.716 g/cm3 can be identified as distinct replicons. It is suggested that the single molecule of R1 observed in E. coli is most simply explained as a composite structure resulting from a recombinational assemblage of a 1.709 and 1.716 g/cm3 replicon.

Colicinogenic factors ColE1 and ColE2 are bacterial plasmids that exist in Escherichia coli as supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and as strand-specific, relaxation complexes of supercoiled DNA and protein. Newly replicated ColE1 DNA becomes complexed with protein after the replication event. This association of DNA and protein can take place under conditions in which DNA or protein synthesis is arrested. The addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) to normal cells growing in glucose medium results in a six- to tenfold stimulation in the rate of synthesis of the protein component(s) of the complex and a three- to fivefold stimulation in the rate of ColE1 DNA replication. Employing mutants deficient in catabolite gene activator protein or adenylate cyclase, it was shown that synthesis of both the plasmid-determined protein colicin E1 and the protein component(s) of the ColE1 relaxation complex is mediated through the c-AMP-catabolite gene activator protein system. Addition of c-AMP to ColE2-containing cells results in the stimulation of synthesis of ColE2 DNA and relaxation protein(s) as well as in the production of a protein component of the ColE2 relaxation complex that renders it sensitive to induced relaxation by heat treatment. In the case of ColE2, synthesis of the relaxation protein(s) is not dependent upon catabolite gene activator protein.

The polydisperse circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules which comprise up to 30% of the total extractable DNA of Bacillus megaterium strain 216 have been purified and partially characterized. Banding in cesium chlorideethidium bromide by “gradient relaxation” in a fixed-angle rotor provided good resolution of circular and chromosomal DNAs for preparative separations. Renaturation studies on purified circular DNA failed to reveal a rapidly renaturing fraction, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that the majority of the chromosomal nucleotide sequences are represented in the heterogeneous-size population of circular molecules. It is concluded that the circular DNA of B. megaterium does not represent typical bacterial plasmid DNA. The possibility that the circular DNA molecules are the result of the expression of a defective bacteriophage is discussed.

Various species of Streptomyces possess aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Streptomyces kanamyceticus contains an enzyme that acetylates the 6′-amino group of kanamycin A and B, gentamicin C1a, and neomycin. Streptomyces spectabilis produces an enzyme that acetylates the 2′-amino group of the hexose ring of gentamicin C1a. These enzymes catalyze reactions identical to those catalyzed by enzymes found in gram-negative bacteria containing R(antibiotic resistance)-factors. The discovery of these enzymes suggests the possibility of an evolutionary relationship between the aminoglycosideinactivating enzymes (produced by resistance determinants) in bacteria containing R-factors and similar enzymes found in the actinomycetes.

The capacity of Pseudomonas putida PpG7 (ATCC 17,485) to grow on naphthalene, phenotype Nah+, is lost spontaneously, and the frequency is increased by treatment with mitomycin C. The Nah+ growth character can be transferred to cured or heterologous fluorescent pseudomonads lacking this capacity by conjugation, or between phage pf16-sensitive strains by transduction. After mutagenesis, strains can be selected with increased donor capacity in conjugation. Clones which use naphthalene grow on salicylate and carry catechol 2,3-oxygenase, the initial enzyme of the aromatic α-keto acid pathway, whereas cured strains grow neither on salicylate nor naphthalene and lack catechol 2,3-oxygenase, but retain catechol 1,2-oxygenase and the aromatic β-keto adipate pathway enzymes.

Novick, Richard P. (The Rockefeller Institute, New York, N.Y.), and Mark H. Richmond. Nature and interactions of the genetic elements governing penicillinase synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. J. Bacteriol. 90:467–480. 1965.—It has been found previously that penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus each harbor an extrachromosomal element, or plasmid, which apparently carries all the genetic information necessary for penicillinase synthesis. These plasmids behave in a manner consistent with their being small chromosomelike structures in that they comprise linkage groups containing several markers and in that they undergo such genetic events as mutation, segregation, and recombination. There is currently no evidence for conjugal cell-cell transfer of the plasmids or for a state of stable integration into the staphylococcal chromosome. A certain amount of variability has been encountered among the penicillinase plasmids harbored by different staphylococcal strains. It has been found that: (i) there are at least three molecular variants of the enzyme itself; (ii) most, but not all, of the penicillinase plasmids carry a genetic determinant of resistance to mercuric ion; (iii) plasmids carried by a very small number of the strains bear a determinant of resistance to erythromycin; (iv) the plasmids determine the fraction of penicillinase excreted into the medium during growth, and this also varies from strain to strain. The penicillinase plasmids appear to behave as integral genetic structures. The entire known linkage group is transduced intact, and is occasionally lost completely as a spontaneous occurrence during the growth of the organisms. Rarely, the plasmid markers dissociate during transduction, resulting in transduced clones which have inherited only a part of the plasmid linkage group. Similarly, dissociation occurs as a spontaneous event during normal growth, also resulting in rare clones which appear to have lost one or more but not all of the plasmid markers. When crosses are performed between two plasmid-harboring strains, a plasmid heterozygote is formed. In most cases, this persists for only one or a few cell divisions before segregating, with or without the formation of recombinant plasmids. In two instances thus far observed, the heterozygote persists as a stable plasmid heterodiploid, in which the continued presence of both plasmids can be readily demonstrated. The fate of the heterozygote, i.e., early segregation or persistence as a heterodiploid, depends upon which particular pair of plasmids is involved in the cross. This observation has led to the hypothesis of a plasmid-linked determinant of plasmid compatibility. A pair of plasmids is considered compatible if it can form a stable heterodiploid, incompatible if it cannot.Images	Nature and Interactions of the Genetic Elements Governing Penicillinase Synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus	Richard P.

A study has been done of reversion to thermostability of thermosensitive, replication-defective (TSR) mutant penicillinase plasmids. All three of the expected classes of reversions were encountered: back mutation, suppression, and integration. The latter class was examined in some detail and it was found that the presence of the phi 11 phophage enhance the frequency of reversion by integration some 103-fold. Prophage-dependent integration resulted in inactivation of plasmid-linked arsenate and arsenite resistance; these revertant strains gave rise to high frequency tranducing lysates where the plasmid was restored upon transduction to its original TSR state including recovery of these resistances. The integrated plasmid-prophage complexes were stable at high temperatures (43 C) but slow growing and unstable at low (32 C); loss of either plasmid or prophage restored normal growth and stability. Sometimes restoration of the plasmid to its autonomous TSR state was observed and molecular studies showed that in most cases the plasmid was essentially the same size as before integration. In some cases an excision complex was recovered that was more than twice the size of the plasmid and could have been a plasmid-phage co-integrate. Integration also took place in the absence of the ł 11 prophage. These integrations retained all plasmid-linked resistances, were stable at all temperatures, and gave rise to low frequency transducing lysates in which the integrated state was retained upon transduction. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the prophage promotes integration at or near its attachment site.Images	Prophage-dependent plasmid integration in Staphylococcus aureus.

Two of eighteen strains of Bacillus subtilis examined contained covalently closed circular duplex deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of homogeneous size and buoyant density. Strain ATCC 15841 contained about 16 copies per chromosome of plasmid pPL1, a circular DNA element having a molecular weight of about 4.7 times 10(6) and a buoyant density of 1.700. Strain ATCC 7003 contained about one to two copies per chromosome of plasmid pPL2. pPL2 had a molecular weight of about 46 times 10(6) and a buoyant density of 1.696. Strain ATCC 7003 appeared to be closely related to B. subtilis 168 by genetic, physiological, and biochemical criteria. Strain ATCC 15841 appeared to be much less closely related. B. pumilus ATCC 12140 contained two size classes of covalently closed circular duplex DNA. The plasmids pMB1 and pMB2 had molecular weights of about 6.8 times 10(6) and 5.3 times 10(6), respectively, and were present in several copies per chromosome.Images	Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus.

Transpositions of segments of R factor (antibiotic resistance plasmids) to bacteriophage lambda have been selected and characterized. Cells of Escherichia coli harboring R factors that determine kanamycin resistance were infected with phage lambda, and lambdakan transducing lines were obtained. Each of the three examined is unusual when compared to lambda transducing phages containing E. coli chromosomal genes: the kan insertions (a) occur at several sites, each well removed from the integration region POP', (b) are not associated with deletion of lambda phage DNA, and (c) are separable from the lambda genome during transduction or during lytic growth. Two insertions from the same R factor contain 1.5 kilobase sequences repeated in inverted order. The properties of the lambdakan phage suggest that R factors contain systems capable of mediating genetic exchange in the absence of extensive DNA homology. It is suggested that such systems of exchange may have played important roles in R factor evolution.Images	Transposition of R factor genes to bacteriophage lambda.

A sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid of 2.7 times 10-6 to 3.3 times 10-6 daltons which includes the TEM beta-lactamase gene is present on the small plasmid RSF 1030 (R-Amp). This same sequence is present on plasmid derivatives that have received a translocation of deoxyribonucleic acid specifying the TEM beta-lactamase and is also present on naturally occurring plasmids of the F1, F11, N, X, O, I, C, and W incompatibility groups that do not specify ampicillin resistance or specify O-type beta-lactamases.Images	Origin of the TEM-beta-lactamase gene found on plasmids.

The low transformation efficiency of Bacillus subtilis 168 lysogenic for phages ø105 or SPO2 is shown to result from the induction of lytic phage replication in competent cells. Lysogenic competent cells have a higher rate of spontaneous prophage induction than noncompetent cells. Mutants of ø105 and SPO2 which form lysogens resistant to spontaneous induction were isolated, and these lysogens exhibited higher transformation levels than those formed by wild-type phage. These results suggest that the physiological state of competence in B. subtilis promotes prophage derepression leading to cell death and the loss of potential transformants.

Earlier papers demonstrated an extensive genetic exchange among fluorescent Pseudomonads; this one documents for genes specifying enzymes of peripheral dissimilation an extrachromosomal array, segregation, and frequent interstrain transfer. An hypothesis is presented of a general mechanism for the formation and maintenance of metabolic diversity. The example used, the path of oxidative cleavage of the carbocyclic rings of the bicyclic monoterpene D- and L-camphor, terminates in acetate release and isobutyrate chain debranching. By transduction, two gene linkage groups are shown for the reactions before and after isobutyrate. The group for reactions before isobutyrate is plasmid borne, contransferable by conjugation, mitomycin curable, and shows a higher segregation rate from cells that are multiplasmid rather than carrying a single plasmid. The genes that code for isobutyrate and essential anaplerotic and amphibolic metabolism are chromosomal. By conjugation plasmid-borne genes are transferred at a higher frequency than are chromosomal, and are transferred in homologous crosses more frequently than between heterologous species. Most isobutyrate-positive fluorescent pseudomonad strains will accept and express the camphor plasmid.	A Transmissible Plasmid Controlling Camphor Oxidation in Pseudomonas putida	J. G. Rheinwald, A.

A selection procedure was devised to select for mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 with enhanced rates of spontaneous frameshift mutation. Three types of mutants were isolated. Two of the mutations apparently represent alleles of previously isolated mutL13 and mutS3. The third type of mutation, represented by two alleles, lies between lysA and thyA, and has been designated mutR. mutR increases the rate of spontaneous frameshift mutation and also the rate of base substitution mutations. The mutator phenotype is recessive. Reversion of a lac amber mutation located on an episome is increased in the presence of the mutator, indicating that mutR can act in trans. No change in sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C could be found when mutR34 was compared to the isogenic mutR+ strain. The mutator's activity was little affected by the type of medium in which the strain was grown. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools were normal in mutR34. Intergenic recombination frequencies were the same in mutR and mutR and mutR+ strains, but a two- to threefold increase in intragenic recombination was observed in Hfr times Fminus crosses when the recipeint was mutR34 as compared with mutR+. This increase appeared independent of the distance between the two markers within the gene in which the crossover took place.

The structure of F13, a plasmid containing lac, purE, and proC, has been determined by heteroduplex analysis. As expected for an F-prime formed by a type II excision event, it contains all the sequences of F plus a large segment of Escherichia coli chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. There is a sequence of F with coordinates 16.3-17.6F which has been shown in other studies to be the insertion sequence IS2. This IS2 occurs twice on F13, once at each of the two junctions of F deoxyribonucleic acid with chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. The sequence alpha beta which occurs twice on F with coordinates 93.2-94.5/OF and 13.7-15.0F occurs an additional three times, twice in an inverted order relative to the alpha beta sequences of F, on the chromosomal sequences of F13. The structures of the plasmids F13-4 and F210 have been determined. The common sequences of F13 with F152-1 (a derivative of F152, the classical F2gal) and with F13-4 and F210 have been mapped. These results partially map lac, proC, tsx, and purE on F13. On the basis of all of these results, it is proposed that Hfr 13 (the parent of F13) was formed by recirpocal recombination between IS2 on F and an IS2 resident at a point between lac and proC on the chromosome of the F+ parent of Hfr 13. It is proposed that this IS2 and the several alpha beta sequences on the chromosomal part of F13 are hot spots for recombination with F, i.e., for Hfr formation. The point of origin and direction of transfer of many Hfr's can be explained by this hypothesis. In particular, the sequence relations of F42-1 (Flac) and of F152-1 (F 2gal) with F13 are completely consistent with this model.Images	Electron microscopic heteroduplex studies of sequence relations among plasmids of Escherichia coli: structure of F13 and related F-primes.

Heteroduplex experiments between the plasmid R6 and one strand of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence IS1 show that IS1 occurs on R6 at the two previously mapped junctions of resistance transfer factor (RTF) DNA with R-determinant DNA. From previous heteroduplex experiments, it then follows that IS1 occurs at the same junctions in R6-5, R100-1, and R1 plasmids. Heteroduplex experiments with the DNA from a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence IS2 show that one copy of IS2 occurs in R6, R6-5, and R100-1 (but not R1) at a point within the RTF with coordinates 67.5 TO 68.9 kilobase units (kb). In an accompanying paper, Ptashne and Cohen (1975) show that the insertion sequence IS3 occurs on R6 and R6-5. R100-25, a traC mutant, differs from its parent R100-1 only in that it contains an additional copy of IS1 inserted within the tra gene region of 82.1 kb. R100-31, atraX, TC-s mutant of R100-1, is deleted in R100-1 sequences starting at one of the IS3 termini (46.9 kb) and extending with RTF to 61.0 kb. Heteroduplex studies of F plasmids with the DNA of a lambda phage bearing insertion sequence IS2 show that the sequence of F with coordinates 16.3-17.6F is IS2. The occurrence of IS1 at the two junctions of R-determinant DNA and RTF DNA in R plasmids provides a structural basis to explain the mechanism of the previously observed formation of molecules containing one RTF unit and several tandem copies of the R-determinant unit, when R plasmids in Proteus mirabilis are grown in the presence of antibiotics, and the segregation of an R plasmid into an RTF unit and an R-determinant unit. In general, correlation of our results with previous studies shows that insertion sequences play a role in a variety of F- and R-related intra- and intermolecular recombination phenomena.Images	Electron microscope heteroduplex studies of sequence relations among bacterial plasmids: identification and mapping of the insertion sequences IS1 and IS2 in F and R plasmids.

Insertion sequence (IS) regions have been identified previously as a cause of strongly polar mutations in Escherichia coli and several bacteriophages. The present experiments indicate that genetically characterized IS regions occur on bacterial plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as both direct and inverted DNA sequence duplications. The DNA insertion which has been shown previously (Sharp et al., 1973) to control expression of tetracycline resistance in the R6-5 plasmid, and which occurs as directly and inversely repeated DNA sequences adjacent to the region believed to contain the tetracycline resistance gene, has been identified as IS3. A second genetically characterized insertion sequence (IS1) has been identified as a direct DNA duplication occurring at both junctions of the resistance transfer factor and R-determinant components of R6-5 and related plasmids. A model is presented for the reversible dissociation of resistance transfer factor and R-determinant components of co-integrate R plasmids at the sites of DNA sequence homology provided by the repeated IS regions.Images	Occurrence of insertion sequence (IS) regions on plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid as direct and inverted nucleotide sequence duplications.

Previous studies have shown that there is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) segment, of length 1.3 kb and denoted as the alphabeta sequence, which occurs twice on the F plasmid at corrdinates 93.2 to 94.5/OF kb and 13.7 to 15.0F kb. In the present investigation, heteroduplexes were prepared between a phage DNA carrying the insertion sequence IS3 and suitable F-prime DNAs. The hybrids formed show that IS3 is the same as alphabeta. This result plus previous studies support the view that: (i) the insertion sequence IS2 and IS3 occur on F and, in multiple copies, on the main bacterial chromosome of Escherichia coli K-12; and (ii)these IS sequences on the main bacterial chromosomes are hot spots for Hfr formation by reciprocal recombination with the corresponding sequences of F.Images	alphabeta sequence of F is IS31.

A series of recombinant plasmids was generated in Escherichia coli in which the TEM beta-lactamase translocon (TnA) was inserted into the small plasmid RSF1010. RSF1010 is a 5.5 X 10(6) dalton nonconjugative plasmid which confers resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide. The recombinant plasmids can be classified into three clearly defined phenotypic groups. Group I is ampicillin-, streptomycin- and sulfonamide-resistant. Group II is ampicillin- and sulfonamide-resistant but has lost streptomycin resistance. Group III is ampicillin-resistant but is sensitive to sulfonamide and shows a simultaneous 30-fold reduction in the minimal inhibitory concentration of streptomycin. It was possible to map the site of insertion of TnA within RSF1010 by electron microscope studies of DNA heteroduplexes formed between RSF1010 and recombinant plasmids. Insertions of TnA occur at, at least, 12 distinct sites in a region corresponding to one-third of the RSF1010 DNA molecule. Those insertions giving rise to particular phenotypes are clustered. Insertions of TnA-like insertion sequences (IS) appear to give rise to strongly polar mutations.Images	Translocation of a plasmid DNA sequence which mediates ampicillin resistance: molecular nature and specificity of insertion.

Eighty-seven different enterobacteria and pseudomonas strains were examined for the presence of extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Thirty-four strains contained closed circular DNA by the ethidium bromide CsCl density technique. Extrachromosomal DNA was most frequent in Escherichia and Klebsiella strains. The extrachromosomal DNA was isolated and characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. All the extrachromosomal DNA-containing bacteria contained circular DNA molecules of small size (0.5–4 μm). Most of these bacteria also contained larger circles (20–40 μm). The number of different size classes of circular DNA in each strain varied from one to five. The buoyant density of the extrachromosomal DNA ranged from 1.692 to 1.721 g/cm3. Many bacteria contained extrachromosomal DNA of more than one density.Images	Extrachromosomal Deoxyribonucleic Acid in Different Enterobacteria	C. Christiansen, Gunna Christiansen, A. Leth Bak, A.

Controlled shearing of R-factor DNA leads to formation of fragments carrying an antibiotic resistance gene present on, but not expressed by, the intact R-factor. Transformation of CaCl2-treated E. coli by such fragments yields an autonomously replicating tetracycline-resistance plasmid (Tc6-5) that contains only a small fraction of the genome of the parent R-factor, and lacks both its fertility functions and its other drug-resistance determinants. Although the Tc6-5 plasmid is not self-transmissible, it can interact and/or recombine with conjugally-proficient plasmids that promote its transfer to other bacteria.Images	Recircularization and Autonomous Replication of a Sheared R-Factor DNA Segment in Escherichia coli Transformants*	Stanley N.

Beta (β)-lactamases determined by 29 ampicillin resistance plasmids could be divided into two types. One, TEM-type, was very uniform with respect to substrate specificity but heterogeneous in absolute levels of β-lactamase activity. The TEM-type β-lactamase was determined by R factors of compatibility groups FII, Iα, Iε, N, C, A, T, W, P, L, and X, and by prophage φ Amp. The other type, characterized by the ability to hydrolyze oxacillin, was less common, showed lower absolute levels of activity, and was heterogeneous as regards substrate specificities. Oxacillin-hydrolyzing β-lactamases were determined by R factors of compatibility groups FI, Iα, N, C, and O.

Bacillus pumilus NRS 576 harbored an estimated two copies per chromosome of a covalently closed, circular (CCC) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule, the 576 plasmid. The 576 plasmid has a buoyant density of 1.698 g/cm3 and a molecular weight of about 28 × 106. Plasmid copy number remained about the same in both exponentially growing and stationary-phase cells. Spontaneous variants of NRS 576 that formed spores at an elevated frequency were designated as W mutants. W mutants appeared to have lost the 576 plasmid on the basis of the following: W mutants (38 tested) lacked detectable CCC DNA, and the majority of the plasmid homologous sequences in bulk NRS 576 DNA were absent from bulk W mutant DNA. B. pumilus ATCC 7065 harbored at least 10 copies per chromosome of a CCC DNA element, the 7065 plasmid. The 7065 plasmid has a buoyant density of 1.696 g/cm3 and a molecular weight of about 6 × 106. Although the copy number of the plasmid appeared to remain the same in exponentially growing and stationary-phase cells, an additional CCC form of higher molecular weight was detected in stationary-phase cells.Images	Biochemical Studies of Two Bacillus pumilus Plasmids	Paul S.

The enzymes responsible for the oxidation of n-octane to octanoic acid or beyond in Pseudomonas oleovorans are octane inducible and are coded by genes borne on a transmissible extrachromosomal element. The octane to octanoate enzymes induced by octane are repressed by octanol. The chromosome also carries genes coding octanol oxidation enzymes that, in contrast, are induced by octanol, not by octane. The octane plasmid has been transferred from P. oleovorans to several other fluorescent Pseudomonas species. In exconjugants, the presence of both octane and camphor plasmids enhances their segregation rate.	Genetic Regulation of Octane Dissimilation Plasmid in Pseudomonas	A. M. Chakrabarty, G. Chou, I. C.

The octane (OCT) plasmid in Pseudomonas putida derived from the ω-hydroxylase-carrying strain of Coon and coworkers is transferable to the camphor (CAM) plasmid-bearing strain by conjugation or by transduction. While the majority of the Cam +Oct+ exconjugants segregate Cam+ or Oct+ cells, exconjugants with stable Cam +Oct+ phenotype (CAM-OCT) can be detected at a low frequency. The transductants are all of the CAM-OCT phenotype. In the stable Cam +Oct+ strains, the OCT plasmid resembles the CAM plasmid with respect to curing by mitomycin C, transfer in conjugation, and reaction to ts (temperature-sensitive) mutation specifically affecting CAM plasmid replication. Therefore, it is suggested that certain regions of homology exist between the CAM and OCT plasmids that enable them to recombine to form a single plasmid, and to overcome the incompatibility barrier that prevents their coexisting.

The structural determinants for antigen 34 in the E group salmonella are glucosyl substituents on the galactosyl units of the O antigen which has a mannosylrhamnosylgalactose repeating sequence. The temperate bacteriophage ε34 brings about the production of antigen 34. It has been shown here that glucose is transferred from uridine diphosphate glucose to the O antigen via a glucosyl-lipid intermediate in a two-step reaction. Glucose is linked through carbon 1 to the lipid by a phosphodiester bridge, the glucosyl bond having the β-anomeric configuration. The lipid is a C55-polyisoprenoid alcohol, each isoprene unit having one double bond. It is the same lipid which is involved in the synthesis of the O antigen repeating sequence.

1. Multiply resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus often harbor one or more extrachromosomal drug resistant factors as well as temperate prophages capable of mediating generalized transduction. 2. Spontaneous transduction occurs in mixed cultures of such staphylococcal strains, and the extrachromosomal resistance factors are involved more frequently than are chromosomal genes. 3. Spontaneous transduction of extrachromosomal determinants of erythromycin resistance and of linked penicillin-erythromycin resistance occurs in the kidneys of mice in which mixed infection has been induced.

We examined tryptophan regulation in merodiploid hybrids in which a plasmid carrying the trp operon of Escherichia was introduced into Trp mutants of other enteric genera, or in which a plasmid carrying the trpR+ (repressor) gene of E. coli was transfered into fully constitutive trpR mutants of other genera. In these hybrids the trp operon of one species is controlled by the repressor of a different species. Similar investigations were possible in transduction hybrids in which either the trp operon or the trpR+ locus of Shigella dysenteriae was introduced into E. coli. Our measurements of trp enzymes levels in repressed and nonrepressed cells indicate that Trp regulation is normal, with only minor quantitative variations, in hybrids between E coli and Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis. Our results support the idea that a repressor-operator mechanism for regulating trp messenger ribonucleic acid production evolved in a common ancestor of the enteric bacteria, and that this repressor-operator recognition has been conversed during the evolutionary divergence of the Enterobacteriaceae.

An in vitro constructed plasmid, pVH15, consisting of the entire genome of the plasmid ColE1, the tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli, and regions of the bacteriophage PHI80pt190, spontaneously gave rise in E. coli to a mini-ColE1 plasmid consisting of approximately one-half of the ColE1 genome and a small segment of phi80pt190 DNA. This mini-ColE1 plasmid, designated pVH51, has a molecular weight of approximately 2.1 X 10(6) and possesses a single EcoRI restriction site. Heteroduplex analyses showed that about 90% of the pVH51 plasmid hybridizes to about 50% of the ColE1 plasmid. Phenotypically, pVH51 did not produce colicin E1 but conferred immunity to this colicin. The number of mini-ColE1 plasmid molecules per cell was maintained at a four- to fivefold higher level than normal ColE1. A mini-ColE1 hybrid plasmid, designated pML21 and consisting of pVH51 and the kan fragment of plasmid pSC105 inserted at the EcoRI restriction site of mini-ColE1, was maintained at a lower copy number level than pVH51. As in the case of normal ColE1, both pVH51 and pML21 continued to replicate in the presence of chloramphenicol. The promotion of conjugal transfer of pVH51 and pML21 by a self-transmissible plasmid was greatly reduced compared with normal ColE1.Images	Characterization of a mini-ColC1 plasmid.

EcoRI endonuclease digestion of the deoxyribonucleic acid of a phi80 transducing phage carrying the entire tryptophan (trp) operon of Salmonella typhimurium (phi80 S.t.trpE-A) yielded a 4.3 X 10(6)-dalton fragment containing intact trpE, trpD, and trpC and a 3.35 X 10(6)-dalton fragment containing intact trpA. The trpA fragment inserted into EcoRI-cleaved plasmids ColE1 and CR1 was expressed regardless of its orientation of insertion. Mitomycin C, a compound that induces colicin E1 production in ColE1-containing bacteria, stimulated tryptophan synthetase alpha production in cells containing ColE1-TRPA plasmids with the trpA fragment inserted in one orientation but not the other.

Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6), bound in a tight complex at an early T7 promoter, protects 41 to 43 base pairs of DNA from digestion by DNase. I. The protected DNA fragment contains both the binding site for RNA polymerase and the mRNA initiation point for the promoter. The sequence of the DNA fragment and the sequence of the mRNA that it codes for are presented here. A seven-base-pair sequence, apparently common to all promoters, is implicated in the formation of a tight binary complex with RNA polymerase.Images	Nucleotide sequence of an RNA polymerase binding site at an early T7 promoter.

The nucleotide sequence of the region preceding the transcription initiation site of the tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli was determined. Essentially all of the trp operator precedes the transcribed portion of the operon. The deduced sequence contains the recognition site of endonuclease Hpa I. This site is protected from Hpa I cleavage by RNA polymerase and by trp repressor. Regions of 2-fold symmetry are present in the DNA sequence.Images	Nucleotide sequence of region preceding trp mRNA initiation site and its role in promoter and operator function.

We investigated the structural, functional, and regulatory properties of the Shigella dysenteriae tryptophan (trp.) operon in transduction hybrids in which the cysB-trp-region of Escherichia coli is replaced by the corresponding region from S. dysenteriae. Tryptophan biosynthesis was largely blocked in the hybrids, although the order of the structural genes was identical with that of E. coli. Nutritional tests and enzyme assays revealed that the hybrids produced a defective anthranilate synthetase (ASase). Deletion mapping identified two distinct sites in trpE, each of which was partially responsible for the instability and low activity of ASase. We also discovered a pleiotropic site trpP (S) that maps outside the structural gene region and is closely linked to the S. dysenteriae trp operator. trpP (S) reduced the rate of trp messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis, and consequently trp enzyme levels, 10-fold relative to wild-type E. coli. In recombinants in which the structural genes of E coli were under the control of the S. dysenteriae promoter, enzyme levels were also reduced 10-fold. In some fast-growing revertants of the original hybrids, the rates of trp messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis and levels of tryptophan synthetase were restored to values characteristic of wild-type E.coli. Thus, the Trp auxotrophy associated with the S dysenteriae trp operon derives from the combination of a defective ASase and decreased expression of the entire operon imposed by trpP (S).	Naturally occurring sites within the Shigella dysenteriae tryptophan operon severely limit tryptophan biosynthesis.	M D Manson, C Yanofsky	770449	1976-05-01	9	
The approximate genetic map locations of auxotrophic and conditional lethal mutations of Escherichia coli can be rapidly determined with replica plating techniques. A set of patches of 15 streptomycin-sensitive (StrS) Hfr strains with points of origin distributed around the map is replica plated onto a recombinant-selective plate with a lawn of StrR cells which carry an unmapped mutation. The map interval defined by the Hfr points of origin which are closest to the mutant locus is seen by the presence or absence of heavy patches of recombinants produced by transfer of early wild-type genes from the Hfrs. An alternative method is to replicate patches of different mutant strains (100 per plate) onto Hfr lawns; in this case more than 1,000 different mutants can be mapped in a single experiment in a few days. In this way, many types of mutations with similar phenotypes can be grouped as to approximate location on the genetic map. For ordering mutations within groups, the same replica plating methods can be used to cross F-prime derivatives of mutants with other mutants of the same group. Relative merits of these and other mapping methods of E. coli are discussed.Images	Rapid Mapping of Conditional and Auxotrophic Mutations in Escherichia coli K-12	Brooks Low	4570607	1973-02-01	9	
It has been possible to mate two strains harboring F-prime (F′) factors and to isolate from such matings rare recombinants that behave as though the two episomes had fused. Thus, two genes not previously linked may be brought into close proximity.An F′ factor carrying the attachment site for ϕ80 was fused with one carrying the met-ppc-arg region of the chromosome. Lysogenization of such a strain, followed by induction, led to the isolation of ϕ80arg+ and ϕ80met+ transducing phages. This technique may be utilized as a general method for joining diverse bacterial genes to the genome of phage ϕ80.

Three polynucleotide phosphorylase mutations, isolated in heavily mutagenized Escherichia coli strains Q7, Q13, and Q27, were characterized after their transfer by P1 transduction to nearly isogenic strains which lack ribonuclease I. Each strain has a different altered form of polynucleotide phosphorylase. One enzyme exhibited sharply reduced activity under all conditions tested. A second had reduced activity which was stimulated by Mn++. The third enzyme was thermolabile and could be >95% inactivated in vivo at 44 C and pH 6 if the cells were prevented from growing; during growth under these and other conditions, the full enzyme level was maintained. The strains showed no differences from the wild type in their growth rates, their adjustments to changes in media and temperature, or their recoveries from starvation.

Localization of a mutation affecting ribonuclease III activity (an enzyme specific for double-stranded ribonucleic acid) in Escherichia coli was attempted. By a series of matings and transduction experiments, the mutation rnc-105 was mapped near the nadB gene. In strains carrying this mutation, another mutation (ranA2074) was also found. Based on available data, their order on the E. coli chromosome appears to be tyrA, ranA, nadB, rnc, purI. Strains carrying either the ranA2074 or the rnc-105 mutation fail to grow at 45 C in enriched medium, whereas strains carrying only the rnc-105 mutation are defective in ribonuclease III activity. Strains carrying either of these mutations grow more slowly than corresponding wild-type strains in all media tested at all temperatures; the rnc-105 mutation reduces the growth rate more than the ranA2074 mutation. T4 and T7 bacteriophages form plaques with a lower efficiency on strains carrying the rnc-105 mutation than on other strains. Thus we suggest that ribonuclease III is beneficial for normal growth of E. Coli and that at higher temperatures it becomes indispensable.

Treatment of a homogeneous sample of circular DNA molecules that contain at least one single-strand scission per molecule with ligase yields a population of covalently closed circles heterogeneous in the topological winding number alpha. Under proper conditions, the product molecules with different values of alpha can all be resolved by gel electrophoresis. The distributions in alpha for several DNAs, covalently closed at different temperatures, have been determined and the results have been interpreted in terms of thermal fluctuations of the DNA helix.Images	Conformational fluctuations of DNA helix.

"Highly purified nicking-closing enzyme from mouse cells in 20-fold enzyme/substrate excess converts closed circular native PM2, ColE1, and Minicol DNA into limit product sets of DNAs. Each set has a mean degree of supercoiling of approximately zero. The individual species in the sets differ by deltatau = +/-1, +/-2, etc., and the relative masses fit a Boltzmann distribution. It was also demonstrated that ""nonsupercoiled"" closed circular duplex molecules serve as substrates for the nicking-closing enzyme, and that a distribution of topological isomers is generated. Polynucleotide ligase, acting on nicked circular DNA, forms under the same conditions, the same set of closed DNAs. The latter enzyme freezes the population into sets of molecules otherwise in configurational equilibrium in solution.Images"	Action of nicking-closing enzyme on supercoiled and nonsupercoiled closed circular DNA: formation of a Boltzmann distribution of topological isomers.

Five of six independent gonococcal isolates have been found to harbor a plasmid pool of covalently closed-circular deoxyribonucleic acid about 2.4 × 106 daltons in size. The plasmid species were 0.5-mol fraction of guanine plus cytosine and comprised 6 to 8% of the total gonococcal deoxyribonucleic acid equivalent, to approximately 24 to 32 copies per cell. There was no apparent correlation between the presence of these plasmid species and the in vitro clonal variation of gonococci associated with the loss of pili.Images	Characterization of Plasmid Deoxyribonucleic Acid from Neisseria gonorrhoeae	Leonard W.

Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ranging from 5 × 106 to 65 × 106 daltons may be isolated from chromosomal DNA by the preferential precipitation of the higher-molecular-weight chromosomal DNA in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate and a high concentration of NaCl.

Covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid molecules of RSF1030, a nonconjugative R-factor, initiate and complete rounds of semiconservative replication in the absence of protein synthesis long after the bacterial chromosome has ceased its replication. RSF1030 replication under these conditions is sensitive to the inhibitor of ribonucleic acid synthesis, rifampicin. The product of this replication, a covalently closed DNA molecule, shows, in contrast to those molecules produced during the replication in a logarithmically growing culture of Escherichia coli, a transition to the open circular form upon treatment with ribonucleases of alkali. Analysis of the product resulting from alkali treatment indicates that there is a single break in one strand of the original circular duplex. This alkali-sensitive site occurs with equal probability in either of the complementary strands. These results are interpreted as a requirement for an RNA primer for the initiation of RSF1030 DNA synthesis and as showing that its removal from the covalently closed molecule is inhibited in the absence of protein synthesis.

Four ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haempohilus influenzae type b were examined for the presence of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Three resistant strains contained a 30 x 10-6-dalton (30Mdal) plasmid and one resitant strain contained a 3-Mdal plasmid. The ampicillin-sensitive Haemophilus strains examined did not contain plasmid DNA. Transformation of a sensitive H. influenzae strain to ampicillin resistance with isolated plasmid DNA preparations revealed that the structural gene for beta-lactamase resided on both plasmid species. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that the 30-Mdal Haemophilus plasmid contained the ampicillin translocation DNA segment (TnA) found on some R-factors of enteric origin of the H. influenzae plasmids.Images	Plasmid-linked ampicillin resistance in haempohilus influenza type b.

The activity and extent of adenylylation of glutamine synthetase was examined in both free-living and bacteroid forms of Rhizobium japonicum in the presence of excess ammonia. Ammonia caused an apparent repression of glutamine synthetase in free-living R. japonicum and adenylylation of the enzyme was also increased. In contrast, neither the activity nor the extent of adenylylation of the bacteroid enzyme was consistently affected by ammonium treatment of bacteroid suspensions. Similar results were obtained after ammonium treatment of soybean plants even though nitrogenase activity was reduced markedly. We have been unable to demonstrate ammonium repression of nitrogenase activity in R. japonicum-Glycine max symbiotic association that is mediated through bacteroid glutamine synthetase. This result is in contrast to the situation in nitrogen-fixing strains of Klebsiella where a role of glutamine synthetase in the regulation of nitrogenase has been reported.

Cells colicinogenic for the colicin plasmids E1 or E2 (Col E1 and Col E2, respectively) were selected for a loss of colicin production after infection with bacteriophage Mu. Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid that was larger than the original colicin plasmids was found in such cells. A small insertion mutant in Col E1 deoxyribonucleic acid affecting active colicin production without affecting either expression of colicin immunity or Col E1 deoxyribonucleic acid replication was found. Cells carrying this Col E1 plasmid mutant do not exhibit the lethal event associated with colicin E1 induction, suggesting that synthesis of active colicin is required for killing during induction. The altered Col E2 plasmid, containing an insertion at least as large as phage Mu, was maintained unstably in the mutants examined.Images	Isolation and Characterization of Mutants of Colicin Plasmids E1 and E2 After Mu Bacteriophage Infection	Joseph Inselburg	4604640	1974-08-01	9	
Escherichia coli strains were made multiply colicinogenic for the colicin plasmids E1, E2, or E3 (Col E1, Col E2, or Col E3, respectively) by both a deoxyribonucleic acid transformation system and bacterial conjugation. The multiply colicinogenic bacteria constructed exhibited an immunity to the colicins produced by all the plasmids they carried and also produced colicins corresponding to all the plasmids they carried. An incompatibility was observed among the plasmids. In doubly colicinogenic cells where the presence of two plasmids was established, Col E2 was lost more frequently than Col E3. In triply colicinogenic cells, Col E1, Col E2, and Col E3 were lost, with Col E3 being lost least frequently. A significant reduction in the acquisition of a conjugationally transferred Col E1 plasmid by cells colicinogenic for Col E1 was demonstrated.

Replicating DNA molecules of the colicin E1 plasmid isolated from minicells are cleaved at a single site by R1 restriction endonuclease (EcoR1). Electron microscopic measurements of the replicating molecules treated with the endonuclease indicate that (a) replication is initiated at a site between 14% and 20% of the distance from the EcoR1 endonuclease cleavage site; and (b) extensive replication of most molecules occurs in one direction from the initiation site, although a limited amount of replication in the opposite direction may occur. Single-stranded regions at one or both replication forks, involving one or both DNA strands, can be frequently found in replicating molecules.Images	Replication of Colicin E1 Plasmid DNA in Minicells from a Unique Replication Initiation Site	Joseph Inselburg	4601583	1974-06-01	9	
Colicinogenic factor E1 (ColE1) is present in Escherichia coli strain JC411 (ColE1) cells to the extent of about 24 copies per cell. This number does not appear to vary in situations which give rise to twofold differences in the amount of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present per cell. If cells are grown in the absence of glucose, approximately 80% of the ColE1 molecules can be isolated as strand-specific DNA-protein relaxation complexes. When glucose is present in the medium, only about 30% of the plasmid molecules can be isolated as relaxation complexes. Medium shift experiments in which glucose was removed from the medium indicate that within 15 min after the shift the majority (>60%) of the plasmid can be isolated as relaxation complex. This rapid shift to the complexed state is accompanied by a two- to threefold increase in the rate of plasmid replication. The burst of replication and the shift to the complexed state are both inhibited by the presence of chloramphenicol. Inhibition of protein synthesis in log cultures by the addition of chloramphenicol or amino acid starvation allows ColE1 DNA to continue replicating long after chromosomal replication has ceased. Under these conditions, noncomplexed plasmid DNA accumulates while the amount of DNA that can be isolated in the complexed state remains constant at the level that existed prior to treatment. In the presence of chloramphenicol, there appears to be a random dissociation and association of ColE1 DNA and “relaxation protein” during or between rounds of replication.

Colicin plasmids E2 and E3 (Col E2 and Col E3) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been shown to contain, respectively, two and three EcoR1 restriction endonuclease-sensitive sites. This was determined by measuring the DNA fragments generated after EcoR1 endonuclease treatment by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The structure of heteroduplex Col E2-col E3 DNA molecules formed from EcoR1-generated fragments permitted a localization of the EcoR1-sensitive sites on the plasmid chromosomes.Images	Mapping of colicin E2 and colicin E3 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid EcoR-1-sensitive sites.

The plasmid pML 21, which was found to contain approximately 49% of the Col E1 genome was used to determine the template origin of single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments (4 to 32% of the Col E1 units length) associated with Col E1 dna replicative intermediates. The results of DNA hybridization competition experiments indicate that the single-stranded fragments derive from the full length of the Col E1 DNA template as expected for Okazaki fragments and the plasmid pML 21 contains the replication origin of Col E1 DNA.Images	Discontinuous replication of colicin E1 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid.

The structures of molecules of colicin E1 plasmid DNA that were in the process of being replicated in vitro were examined electron microscopically. Circular molecules containing a loop of approximately 7% of the length of the molecules were the major class of replicating molecules. The location of the loop was determined by treating the molecules with restriction endonuclease EcoR1, which introduced one unique double-strand break in the colicin E1 plasmid DNA molecules. The loops had a specific location with two branch points at approximately 17 and 24% of the molecular length from the endonuclease-sensitive site. Molecules with a larger loop were observed with a preparation labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine and enriched for these molecules. One of the branch points in these molecules was located at approximately 17% of the molecular length from the endonuclease-sensitive site independent of the size of the loops. These results indicate that the origin of replication of the plasmid DNA is located within the small loop and the replication proceeds unidirectionally. The molecules that had completed a round of replication had the monomeric twisted circular structure.Images	Replication of Colicin E1 Plasmid DNA in Cell Extracts.

Hfr strains of Escherichia coli K-12 were found capable of accepting a F′lac episome during mating, with a frequency approximating that of F− strains. However, the F′lac episome was unable to replicate in the Hfr cells, and was diluted out during the growth of the culture. The lac+ gene of the episome can be “rescued” by recombination into the host chromosome, as shown by the appearance of variegated recombinant colonies on a lactose-fermentation indicator medium. In recA Hfr strains, however, no lac+ offspring were obtained in crosses with F′lac donors. The induced synthesis of β-galactosidase in F′lac+ × Hfr zygotes was studied. Rates of enzyme synthesis were approximately constant with respect to time as expected from unilinear inheritance of the F′lac episome. However, the rate of synthesis eventually increased, presumably due to integration of the lac+ gene in some of the zygotes. In F′lac+ × recA Hfr zygotes the rate of β-galactosidase synthesis remained constant with respect to time, as expected.

A Klebsiella strain of human origin that was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline was found to have all of these resistances associated with a R factor and a satellite molecular species of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with an average buoyant density of 1.710 in cesium chloride gradients. There was no evidence of the existence of DNA with other buoyant densities. The strain bears two separable mutations for chloramphenicol resistance, both of which are associated with the R factor (KR9). Exposure of the Klebsiella strain to acridine derivatives or to ethidium bromide (which was more efficient) resulted in partial losses of resistance accompanied by the disappearance of the satellite DNA peak or shifts in its density. The R factor and its component genes were conjugally transmitted across generic boundaries and maintained in new hosts with different efficiencies. The basis of this difference lies not only in the efficiency of conjugal transfer but also in the stability of the components after transfer. All of the resistance genes and the resistance transfer factor were cotransducible by phage Plkc from Escherichia coli. Partially resistant strains could be reconstituted to full resistance or to a recombined pattern of partial resistance by conjugation with donors having complementary resistance patterns. This recombination serves as an efficient mechanism for rescuing superinfecting genes that are otherwise intracellularly excluded. KR9 is an fi+ type of R factor which in the natural state does not appear to be as repressed in conjugal transfer as other R factors.

Several hundred independent bacteriocin-tolerant mutants have been isolated without mutagenesis from three strains of Escherichia coli. On the basis of patterns of sensitivity to eight different colicins, over 85% of these mutants could be grouped into four classes. Two classes of mutants, class A and class B, are equivalent to tolA and tolB type mutants. We found tolA and tolB mutants were sensitive to the antibiotic bacitracin. The other two classes of bacteriocin-tolerant mutants, class F and class G, are distinguished from other types of colicin-tolerant mutants on the basis of sensitivity to colicins, dyes, detergents, antibiotics, and chelating agents. The mutation in class F and class G mutants is located between 21 to 23 min on the E. coli chromosome. We propose to designate the loci of these mutations as tolF and tolG, respectively.

Two nonconjugative R-plasmids, N-SuSm and N-Tc, have been characterized. Both were of relatively small size (5 × 106 to 6 × 106 daltons) and present in multiple copies within their respective bacterial hosts. N-SuSm possessed a guanine plus cytosine content of 55%, whereas N-Tc was 49% guanine plus cytosine. Although these plasmids were inherently nontransmissible they could be mobilized by a large variety of transfer agents including Ent, Hly, and K88. The fi− transfer factors tested were far more likely (about 200×) to mobilize these nonconjugative plasmids than were the fi+ transfer factors tested. Although the mobilization phenomenon was not found to be associated with a detectable level of direct stable recombinational union between N-SuSm or N-Tc with a transfer factor, we were able to demonstrate a low level of recombination between these replicons and a transfer factor by P1-mediated transduction. The isolation of recombinants between transfer factors and nonconjugative plasmids presumably represents one means by which unitary molecular types of R-plasmids arise and by which existing R-plasmids may acquire new resistance determinants.

Transformation was used to perform ratio test crosses with mutant strains of Azotobacter vinelandii unable to fix N2. Mutations that simultaneously eliminated both components of nitrogenase (nif-1 and nif-2) were tightly linked. The nif-45 mutation that resulted in the absence of an active molybdenum cofactor was closer to nif-1 and nif-2 than to any of the other nif mutations. Strains that lacked component I carried mutations that were closely linked to each other. Mutations that probably were located in the structural genes for components I and II appeared to be relatively close to each other on the A. vinelandii genome.

We have developed a convenient and specific positive selection for long deletions through the gal region of the chromosomes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Through simultaneous selection for mutations in the two closely linked genes, gal and chlA, a variety of deletions of varying length, some extending through as much as 1 min of the chromosome, could be readily obtained. Many of these deletions resulted in the loss of a gene, which we named dhb, concerned with the ability of the bacterium to synthesize the iron chelating agent enterobactin. The selection was adapted for the screening of mutagens for their ability to generate long deletions in the bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid. Forty agents were screened for this capability. Nitrous acid, previously reported to be an efficient mutagen for this purpose, increased the frequency of deletion mutations 50-fold in our system. Three others, nitrogen mustard, mitomycin C, and fast neutrons, were shown to increase the frequency of long deletions between five- and eightfold. The remainder were found to be incapable of generating these deletions.

Escherichia coli C strains can grow at the expense of the two natural pentitols ribitol and D-arabitol, sugar alcohols previously thought not to be utilized by E. coli. E. coli strains K-12 and B cannot utilize either compound. The genetic loci responsible for pentitol catabolism in E. coli C, designated rtl and atl, are separate and closely linked. Each lies between metG and his and is highly co-transducible with metG and with a P2 prophage attachment site. rtl and atl readily can be transduced into E. coli K-12 or B strains, in which they integrate at, or very near, their E. coli C location. Transduction also can be used to insert rtl and atl into certain E. coli K-12 F' plasmids. No recombination between E. coli C strains and either K-12 or B strains occurs within the rtl-atl genetic region after interstrain conjugations or transductions. No cryptic rtl or atl genes in K-12 or B strains can be detected by complementation, recombination, or mutagenesis. These results are consistent with the view that the rtl-atl portion of the E. coli C chromosome has no counterpart in E. coli K-12 or B and may have been obtained from an extrageneric source. Detailed biochemical and genetic comparisons of penitol utilization in E. coli and Klebsiella aerogenes are in progress. The ability to catabolize xylitol is conferred upon E. coli C strains by a mutation at or adjacent to the rtl locus, whereas in E. coli K-12 or B strains harboring rtl an additional mutation at a separate locus is required for xylitol utilization.

Episome F' ts114 lac+, his+ (F42-400) was transferred from Salmonella typhimurium to Klebsiella pneumoniae. From the progeny, a strain of K. pneumoniae able to retransfer the episome was obtained. The His+ phenotype in this strain is temperature sensitive. Escherichia coli female-specific phages phiII, W31, and T3 were shown to plate on K. pneumoniae. From phiII we obtained two derivatives; phiIIK, which plates only on K. pneumoniae, and phiIIE, which plates only on E. coli. Growth of phages T3 and phiIIK was inhibited by F42-400 in K. pneumoniae. Growth in presence of acridine orange in a defined medium at 40 C resulted in a high level of curing. The frequency of His+ cells after growth in acridine orange at 40 C was 0.001%. An extensive search to detect chromosome mobilization by F42-400 in K. pneumoniae, under different experimental conditions, was negative. We cannot exclude the possibility that the low transfer efficiencies prevented our detection of chromosome mobilization. A search among temperature-resistant, acridine orange-curing-resistant, or galactose-resistant derivatives of the K. pneumoniae donor strain failed to reveal any chromosome transfer. Our failure to detect Hfr's may be a result of: (i) the peculiarity of episome F42-400, (ii) the peculiarity of K. pneumoniae chromosome, or (iii) low transfer efficiency. K. pneumoniae-modified F42-400 and phage 424 were restricted by E. Coli K-12. E. coli K-12-modified episome F42-400 and phage 424 were restricted by K. pneumoniae. E. coli C failed to restrict F42-400 modified with K. pneumoniae specificity. The ability of K. pneumoniae to accept F42-400 is less, by about a factor of 50, than that of E. coli C. As an explanation for the differences in the behavior of E. coli C and K. pneumoniae in ability to receive F42-400 it was suggested that recipient bacteria have specific sites for interaction with the F-pilus tip; these are present in E. Coli C, leading to high transfer efficiency, whereas they may not be present (or if present, are not accessible) in K. pneumoniae, leading to low transfer efficiency.

An auxotrophic strain of E. coli K12 treated with CaCl2 was transformed for several markers at a frequency of up to 10-6 per recipient cell by a DNA preparation isolated from a prototrophic strain. The transforming activity of the DNA preparation was eliminated by treatment with DNase, heat, or sonication, whereas RNase or Pronase treatment had little effect. Two closely linked genetic markers (leu and ara) showed a high degree of cotransformation linkage when high molecular weight DNA was used, but the linkage was almost completely eliminated when sheared, smaller molecular weight DNA was used. There is genetic evidence that the transformation is a result of the replacement of the preexisting genetic marker on the chromosome by that of the donor DNA.

Episome F' ts114 lac+ (F42-114) was transferred into Salmonella typhimurium carrying an F'his+ (FS400) episome, and fused episome F' ts114 lac+, his+ (F42-400) was obtained. Episome F42-400 could be transferred to S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Identification of the episome was based on: (i) temperature sensitivity of the Lac+ and His+ phenotypes; (ii) the fact that F- segregants, obtained after temperature curing or acridine orange curing, were simultaneously Lac- and His-; and (iii) linkage of lac+ with his+ in episomal transfers to E. coli and S. typhimurium. The frequency of episome transfer was influenced by the genotype of the donor. Plasmid LT2, prevalent in S. typhimurium LT2 strains, was suggested to be responsible for the low fertility of S. typhimurium donors. Episome F42-400 was capable of chromosome mobilization, and the extent of chromosome mobilization was not influenced by the presence or absence of the histidine region on the donor chromosome. Growth in a defined medium with acridine orange was able to cure F42-400. The frequency of curing was increased (the frequency of His+ cells was 0.0001%) if the cells were grown at 40 C in the presence of acridine orange. Selection for temperature-resistant Lac+, His+ derivatives in a strain without histidine deletion yielded Hfr strains. However, similar and stronger selections in strains without the chromosomal histidine region failed to yield Hfr strains. Our inability to obtain Hfr's in strains without the chromosomal histidine region was explained by assuming that the episome F42-400 has lost the F sites involved in integration into the S. typhimurium chromosome.

A recA-independent recombinational event is described which results in insertion of an entire plasmid genome at a unique site of another plasmid, and coincident excision of a precisely defined DNA segment originally present at the point of the insertion. The resulting recombinant molecules subsequently can undergo site-specific translocation of their component segments or inversion of their original DNA sequence orientation. The events observed entail nonreciprocal exchange of genetic material, and involve a discrete nucleotide sequences that is duplicated in rotationally symmetrical reverse orientation on plasmid DNA (i.e., inverted repeat; palindrome).Images	Site specific recA--independent recombination between bacterial plasmids: involvement of palindromes at the recombinational loci.

A hybrid plasmid, pSC134, that codes for two distinct sets of replication functions has been constructed in vitro by ligation of EcoRI endonuclease-cleaved pSC101 and Col E1 plasmid replicons, and has been introduced into Escherichia coli by transformation. The replication properties of the pSC134 plasmid in DNA polymerase I-defective mutants or in the presence of chloramphenicol indicate that this hybrid plasmid can utilize the functionally distinct modes of replication specified by both of its parent replicons.Images	Utilization of Two Distinct Modes of Replication by a Hybrid Plasmid Constructed In Vitro from Separate Replicons	Kenneth Timmis, Felipe Cabello, Stanley N.

Incompatibility between R factors has been reported by several authors, and four incompatibility groups have already been described by Datta and Hedges among Rfi− factors. The stability of 12 plasmids in pairs was studied after 116 crosses, and five new groups were found, designated 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each plasmid studied belongs to one single group. Incompatibility between plasmids in pairs is a clear-cut phenomenon, is easy to observe, and can provide a reliable method for recognizing and classifying resistance factors, and for tracing their spread among bacterial species.

DNA preparations from two strains of Bacillus megaterium, one which produces megacin and another that is megacin sensitive, were analyzed by dye-buoyant density centrifugation, cesium chloride gradient equilibrium centrifugation in the absence of dye, zone sedimentation in sucrose, and electron microscopy. Both strains were found to contain a substantial proportion of their total DNA as circular, covalently closed, double helical molecules. These DNA elements were heterogeneous in size and appeared slightly less dense than chromosomal DNA. The physiological role and origin of these elements is unknown at present.Images	HETEROGENEOUS CIRCULAR DNA ELEMENTS IN VEGETATIVE CULTURES OF Bacillus megaterium*	Bruce C. Carlton, Donald R.

Six different Staphylococcus aureus plasmids have been examined for compatibility relationships and their intracellular DNA pools have been measured singly and in various combinations. All six were mutually compatible, but contrary to expectation, their intracellular DNA pools were not additive; instead, there appeared to be a maximum level of extrachromosomal DNA that could be supported by the cell, and the plasmids studied approached this level individually as well as in varous combinations. One exception was encountered: a plasmid encoding kanamycin/neomycin resistance was present in a small but constant number of copies regardless of the presence of other plasmids.

All 17 Salmonella typhi strains tested from the epidemic in Mexico carried R factors of compatibility group H, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides. Some S. typhi strains carried, in addition, non-conjugative, ampicillin resistance plasmids and R factors of the I or A–C complex. All 20 Shigella dysenteriae 1 strains tested of epidemic origin carried O-group R factors. Ampicillin resistance in S. dysenteriae 1 was not proved to be plasmid borne. R factors of group H were not identified in any of the tested Mexican isolates other than S. typhi, but R factors of group O were identified in Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and one strain of S. typhi, as well as in the epidemic S. dysenteriae. An R factor was identified which seemed to have two compatibility specificities, groups Iω and O.

Eighty-four transfer-deficient mutants of Flac have been isolated; 27 of these bear amber mutations and 1 mutant is temperature-sensitive. All the mutants transfer between 10−2 and <10−5% as well as wild-type Flac, all are curable by acridine orange treatment, and all are resistant to the female-specific phage φII. Some of the mutants are partially sensitive to female-specific phage tau. Sixty-three of the mutants are resistant to the male-specific phages f1, f2, and Qβ; 15 are resistant only to f2; and 6 are sensitive to all three male-specific phages. Most of the mutants are still poor recipients in conjugation, but four of the mutants resistant to f1, f2, and Qβ have become good recipients. Those mutants resistant to all three male-specific phages do not seem to make F-pili.

Bacteriol. 91:1763–1766. 1966.—A glycerol kinase mutant site has been mapped by transduction and sexual conjugation. Three-factor crosses with the two procedures yielded the following gene order: arginine-1–methionine-1–glycerol kinase–isoleucine, valine-16. An additional 13 independent glycerol kinase mutant sites mapped in the same region. Since some of the mutants were able to produce a protein serologically indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme, it is concluded that the region mapped represents the structural gene for the kinase.

Among mutants which require isoleucine, but not valine, for growth, we have found two distinguishable classes. One is defective in the biosynthetic enzyme threonine deaminase (l-threonine hydro-lyase, deaminating, EC 4.2.1.16) and the other has an altered isoleucyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase [l-isoleucine: soluble RNA ligase (adenosine monophosphate), EC 6.1.1.5]. The mutation which affects ileS, the structural gene for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, is located between thr and pyrA at 0 min on the map of the Escherichia coli chromosome. This mutationally altered isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase has an apparent Km for isoleucine (∼1 mm) 300-fold higher than that of the enzyme from wild type; on the other hand, the apparent Vmax is altered only slightly. When the mutationally altered ileS allele was introduced into a strain which overproduces isoleucine, the resulting strain could grow without addition of isoleucine. We conclude that the normal intracellular isoleucine level is not high enough to allow efficient charging to tRNAIle by the mutant enzyme because of the Km defect. A consequence of the alteration in isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase was a fourfold derepression of the enzymes responsible for isoleucine biosynthesis. Thus, a functional isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is needed for isoleucine to act as a regulator of its own biosynthesis.

Bacteriol. 85:1394–1401. 1963.—Two different F′ strains were found to transfer both F-merogenote and chromosomal markers to recipient strains. When zygotes having received different chromosomal markers from the male were selected, a high percentage of them were found to have also received F-merogenote markers under conditions in which the mating of more than one male cell with a single female cell was excluded. An analysis of the kinetics of zygote formation revealed that chromosomal markers began to be transferred from F′ strains 8 to 10 min later than from their analogous Hfr strains. The rate of chromosome transfer is the same from both F′ and Hfr strains, and the difference observed in kinetic experiments was shown not to be due to any difference between the sequence of chromosomal genes in the F′ and Hfr strains. F′ strains and Hfr strains showed no difference in ability to form specific pairs with female recipients shortly after mixing. The observed delay in the transfer of chromosomal markers from F′ cells thus means that, after specific pair formation, F′ cells take 8 to 10 min longer than Hfr cells to initiate chromosome transfer.

Ramakrishnan, T. (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.), and Edward A. Adelberg. Regulatory mechanisms in the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine. II. Identification of two operator genes. J. Bacteriol. 89:654–660. 1965.—A tightly clustered set of five structural genes governs the synthesis of the five enzymes of isoleucine and valine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Three of the genes governing transaminase B, dehydrase, and threonine deaminase, are controlled by a single operator locus, designated oprA. The structural gene governing the condensing enzyme is controlled by a second operator locus, designated oprB. Both oprA and oprB have been shown to regulate structural genes which are cis, but not trans, to their own operator. No mutations have yet been found which affect the level of reductoisomerase, but the existence of a third operator controlling the synthesis of this enzyme can be inferred. Enzyme derepression resulting from mutations in oprA confers resistance to high levels of valine. Derepression of the condensing enzyme resulting from mutations in oprB confers resistance to low levels of valine, and to α-aminobutyric acid. The significance of these findings with respect to the valine sensitivity of E. coli strain K-12 is discussed.	Regulatory Mechanisms in the Biosynthesis of Isoleucine and Valine II.

Map order of the structural genes and operator genes. J. Bacteriol. 89:661–664. 1965.—A new method has been employed to determine the map order of the structural genes and operator genes governing the enzymes of the isoleucine-valine biosynthetic pathway. This method relies on the observation that phage transduction of markers carried on an F-genote leads to the establishment in the recipient of F-genotes of various lengths. Using this method, we have established that the order of loci is the following: F/ilvE ilvD ilvA oprA/ilvC/ilvB oprB. The operator locus, oprA, regulates the activity of structural genes ilvE (transaminase B), ilvD (dehydrase), and ilvA (threonine deaminase). The operator locus, oprB, regulates the activity of ilvB (condensing enzyme). An operator for ilvC (reductoisomerase) can be inferred to exist, but has not yet been detected genetically. The loci ilvB and oprB have been shown to be at the extreme right end of the sequence, but their positions relative to each other remain to be established.

Pittard, James (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.). Effect of integrated sex factor on the transduction of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 89:680–686. 1965.—Generalized transducing phage P1kc can contransduce the markers tna and ilv in Escherichia coli K-12 at a frequency of approximately 25%. When sex factor is integrated into the donor chromosome between tna and ilv, as in Hfr AB313, the entire sequence tna F ilv is not cotransduced at a detectable frequency, nor is F cotransduced with either tna or ilv. The frequency with which ilv is transduced from Hfr AB313 to female recipients is approximately one-eighth the frequency obtained when either F+ or female strains are used as donors. This reduction of transduction frequency does not occur if the recipient is an Hfr male similar to AB313. The reduction is attributed to pairing difficulties which occur when the transduced fragment carrying the ilv genes also carries sex-factor material. When ilv+ is transduced from a female to an ilv− derivative of AB313, 70% of the transductants are converted to F+ males. A model is proposed to account for all of these observations.

"Mutants lacking Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase (pfkA, 78 min) are suppressed by the unlinked pfkB1 mutation, which restores some enzyme activity (Morrissey and Fraenkel, 1972). We here describe a secondary mutation at pfkB, ""PFKB-,"" which abolishes the suppression as well as the low residual activity of unsuppressed pfkA mutants. pfkB is at about 33 min. with the gene order groD-pps-pheS-pfkB. A positive selection was found that yielded both the pfkB-mutations and a new similar mutation, pfkC-. pfkC is an early marker in Hfr HL16(ca. 50 to 55 min). Some pfkC-, but no pfkB-, mutations were amber. A temperature-sensitive pfkB- was also obtained. Strains carrying pfkB- or pfkC-, but wild type at pfkA, were not markedly affected in growth on sugars. A new search for suppressors such as pfkB1 gave five independent candidates, all of which suppressed both pfkA1 and pfkA2 and occurred in the pfkB region; none occurred at pfkC. Neither the pfkB nor the pfkC loci have assigned functions. It is likely that they are somehow involved in expression of phosphofructokinase activity 2 (Fraenkel, Kotlarz, and Buc, 1973)."

pfkA was know, on the basis of three mutants, as the likely locus of phosphofructokinase in Escherichia coli, and the unlinked pfkB1 mutation suppressed these mutations by restoring some enzyme activity (Morrissey and Fraenkel, 1972). We now report a new search for the complete inactivation of pfkA (e.g., by deletion or amber mutation), done to assess whether the pfkB1 suppression is by an independent enzyme, phosphofructokinase activity 2 (Fraenkel, Kotlarz, and Buc, 1973). Ten new phosphofructokinase mutants all were at pfkA, rather than at pfkB or pfkC. One of them (pfkA9) gave temperature-sensitive reverants with heat-labile enzyme. Another (pfkA11) proved genetically to be a nonsense mutation, but showed no restored activity when suppressed by supF. However, even unsuppressed it was found to contain an enzyme related to phosphofructokinase activity 1 kinetically (more allosteric), physically (almot identical subunit), and antigenically. All the pfkA mutants apparently contained cross-reacting material to activity 1. All (including pfkA11) were suppressed by the pfkB1 mutation. Several results support the idea that pfkA is the structural gene for the main phosphofructokinase of E. coli (activity 1), but that there is some restriction to its complete inactivation.Images	PfkA locus of Escherichia coli.

A spontaneous leu-linked mutation (ilvH2015) in Escherichia coli K-12 made the strain resistant to 1 mM valine and l mM glycylvaline (Val-r) and caused the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzyme, acetohydroxy acid synthase, to be less sensitive to feedback inhibition by valine than the wild-type enzyme. Transfer of the ilvDAC deletion into a strain carrying ilvH2015 abolished the effect of the marker on the acetohydroxy acid synthase and rendered it as sensitive to valine as the enzyme in the isogenic control strain without the Val-r marker under both repressing and limiting conditions. In contrast, auxotrophy caused by transfer of an ilvC lesion into the Val-r strain did not interfere with the effect of ilvH2015 on valine sensitivity of acetohydroxy acid synthase. In addition, the presence of the Val-r marker produced minor but significant pleiotropic effects on several other isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes but did not cause derepression of the ilv gene cluster. These studies suggest some type of interaction between a product produced by a gene close to leu and the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes.

The mutation mut-25 that results in a mutator phenotype is closely linked to purA on the chromosome of Escherichia coli. The gene order in this region is ampA mut-25 purA. purA mut-25 double mutants retained mutator activity indicating that mut-25 is not a mutation in the purA gene. The repair mutations uvrA6, recA56, and exrA1 had no effect on mutation frequencies in mut-25 strains, and mut-25 strains were normally resistant to ultraviolet irradiation. Frequencies of host range mutations were not increased in phages T1, T2, and T7 grown on mut-25 strains. mut-25 could act trans, reverting the trpA46 mutation either on the chromosome or on an F episome.

The dna-1, dna-2, dna-7, and dna-28 mutations, all of which are located near min 89.5 on the E. coli linkage map, have been characterized further. As previously demonstrated for dna-2 and dna-28, neither the dna-1 nor dna-7 mutation affects the ability of a strain to produce bacteriophage lambda at temperatures non-permissive for the continued replication of the bacterial chromosome. The reported temperature-sensitive inhibition of lambda production in a strain carrying dna-7 is shown to be a consequence of a thermosensitive host specificity mutation in the hsm gene and not of the dna-7 mutation. The four dna mutations are recessive to the wild type and define a single dnaC cistron according to standard complementation criteria. Unlike other characterized dnaC mutants, however, strains carrying the dnaC1 or dnaC7 alleles exhibit an abrupt cessation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis at 42 C that appears to be more compatible with a defect in deoxyribonucleic acid chain elongation rather than in initiation. The possibility that the apparent elongation defect is actually a composite effect of residual synthesis and deoxyribonucleic acid degradation is raised by the net deoxyribonucleic acid degradation observed in the dnaC1 strain at 42 C. Several alternative possibilities for the function of the dnaC gene product are suggested.	Genetic and phenotypic characterization of dnaC mutations.	J A Wechsler	1089638	1975-02-01	9	
fabD mutants of Escherichia coli contain a thermolabile malonyl-coenzyme A-acyl carrier protein transacylase which causes defective fatty acid synthesis and temperature-sensitive growth. By conjugation and P1 transduction the fabD locus has now been mapped at min 24, between pyrC and purB and close to cat. The order of sites is tentatively given as pyrC, cat, fabD, and purB, though the orientation of cat and fabD could be reversed. The possible relationship of fabD with another mutation lying in this region and also affecting acid synthesis is discussed. In the course of these studies we also confirmed the location of the fabA gene, determined that poaA lies between fabA and pyrC, and inadvertently found that the pyr mutation in strain AT3143 is probably pyrF and not pyrC.

We have isolated four classes of mutants resistant to alpha-dehydrobiotin, a biotin analogue. One mutant group, referred to as bioR shows high excretion levels of biotin vitamers, derepressed levels of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes, and resistance to repression by biotin. The mutation has been mapped between argC and bfe at min 79. A second class of mutants, with lesions in the bioA operon at min 17.5, shows derepressed levels of the dethiobiotin synthetase enzyme and has been tentatively designated as bioO mutants. The other two mutant groups show alterations in permeability: biotin uptake is markedly reduced in one, whereas in the other proline uptake is also affected. The former mutation lies near metE at min 75 and has been designated as bioP. The permeability mutants in the second group also show poor growth on minimal media, suggesting a generalized permeability effect. This mutation, designated as P, has not been mapped.

The glutamyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase (GluRS) of a partial revertants (ts plus or minus) of the thermosensitive (ts) mutant strain JP1449 (LOcus gltx) and of a ts mutant strain EM111-ts1 with a lesion in or near the locus gltx have been studied to find the relation between these two genetic loci known to influence the GluRS activity in vitro and the presence of a catalytic subunit and of a regulatory subunit in the GluRS purified from Escherichia coli K-12. The ts character of strain JP1449-18ts plus or minus is co-transduced with the marker dsdA at the same frequency as is the ts character of strain JP1449. Its purified GluRS is very thermolabile and its Km for glutamate is higher than that of a wild-type GluRS. These results indicate that the locus gltX is in the structural gene for the catalytic subunit of this enzyme. The location of the mutation causing the partial ts reversion in strain JP1449-18ts plus or minus is discussed. The GluRS purified from the ts mutant strain EM111-ts1 has the same stability as the wild-type enzyme, but its Km forglutamate increases with the temperature, suggesting that the locus gltE codes for a regulatory factor, possibly for the polypeptide chain that is co-purified with the catalytic subunit.

The study of suppressors of tryptophan synthase A protein missense mutations in Escherichia coli has led to the establishment of two nonadjacent genetic loci (gly V and gly W) specifying identical nucleotide sequences for a single isoaccepting species of glycine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA GLY 3 GGU/C). In one case, suppression of the missense mutation trpA78 was due to a mutation in a structural gene (gly W) for tRNA Gly 3 GGU/C. This mutation resulted in a base change in the anticodon and modification of an A residue adjacent to the 3' side of the anticodon, leading to the production of a tRNA Gly 3 UGU/C species. The resulting glyW51 (SU UGU/C) allele was mapped by interrupted mating and was located at approximately 37 min on the Escherichia coli genetic map. Other suppressor mutations affecting the primary sequence of tRNA Gly GGU/C and giving rise to the Ins and SU+A58 phenotypes were positioned at 86 min (glyV). Several independently arising missense suppressor mutations resulting in the SU+A78 phenotypes were isolated and mapped at these two genetic loci (glyV and glyW). The ratio of appearance of suppressor mutations at glyV and glyW suggests that there are three of four tRNAGly3 GGU/C structural gene copies at the glyV locus to one copy at the glyW locus. Structural genes for tRNA ly isoacceptors are now known at four distinct locations on the Escherichia coli chromosome: glyT (77 MIN), TRNA Gly 2 GGA/G; gly U (55 min), tRNAGly-1 minus; and gly V (86 MIN) AND GLYW (37 min), tRNAGly 3 GGU/C.

The suppressor sul, which is allele specific for the ultraviolet sensitivity gene lon, has been mapped by conjugation and transductional crosses in Escherichia coli K-12 and B/r. Previously, sul was reported to lie in the azi region of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Evidence is presented which positions sul close to and clockwise of fabA on the Escherichia coli map. Cotransductional frequencies of 31.3% were obtained between sul and pyrD, and frequencies of 82% were obtained between sul and fabA. Also, the mucoid phenotype of K-12 lon strains grown on minimal glucose agar plates at 37 C was not significantly effected in sul derivatives. No differences between the sul of Escherichia coli B/r and that of K-12 derivatives with regard to map location or effect on mucoid production were observed.

The mapping data is consistent with a gene location for envB around 62.5 min. In partial diploids envB1 was recessive to its wild-type allele. The original envB mutant contained a second mutation in a locus denoted sloB close to strA. The following gene order is suggested: sloB-strA-aroE-envB-aspB-argG. The sloB1 mutation caused a marked reduction in the growth rate of both envB and envB+ strains. Moreover, this mutation in the presence of envB1 appears to increase the ratio between deoxyribonucleic acid and protein in cells growing in rich medium. The phenotypic properties of envB1, sloB+ and envB+ transductants were characterized. Cells with envB1, sloB+ genotype were hypersensitive to several penicillins including the beta-lactam compound, amidino penicillin. Penicillin hypersensitivity could not be explained by increased outer membrane penetrability. The original envB mutant (envB1,SLOB1), as well as envB1, sloB1 or envB+, SLOB1 transductants were resistant to amidino penicillin. Resistance was explained by the slow growth rate mediated by the sloB1 mutation. The similarity between envB cells and wild-type cells treated with sublethal concentrations of amidino penicillin was emphasized.

Three independently isolated metK mutants have been shown to have leisions lying between speB and glc near 57 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. Two deletions result in a lack of the metC gene product but neither extends into the metK glc region. The three metK mutations are recessive to the wild-type allele carried on the KLF16 episome.

chlD mutants of Escherichia coli lack active nitrate reductase but form normal levels of this enzyme when the medium is supplemented with 10-3 M molybdate. When chlD mutants were grown in unsupplemented medium and then incubated with molybdate in the presence of chloramphenicol, they formed about 5% the normal level of nitrate reductase. Some chlD mutants or the wild type grown in medium supplemented with tungstate accumulated an inactive protein which was electrophoretically identical to active nitrate reductase. Addition of molybdate to those cells in the presence of chloramphenicol resulted in the formation of fully induced levels of nitrate reductase. Two chlD mutants, including a deletion mutant, failed to accumulate the inactive protein and to form active enzyme under the same conditions. Insertion of 99-Mo into the enzyme protein paralleled activation; 185-W could not be demonstrated to be associated with the accumulated inactive protein. The rates of activation of nitrate reductase at varying molybdate concentrations indicated that the chlD gene product facilitates the activation of nitrate reductase at concentrations of molybdate found in normal growth media. At high concentrations, molybdate circumvented this function in chlD mutants and appeared to activate nitrate reductase by a mass action process. We conclude that the chlD gene plays two distinguishable roles in the formation of nitrate reductase in E. coli. It is involved in the accumulation of fully induced levels of the nitrate reductase protein in the cell membrane and it facilitates the insertion of molybdenum to form the active enzyme.Images	chlD gene function in molybdate activation of nitrate reductase.

The transducing phage lambdarifd18 isolated by Kirschbaum and Konrad [(1973 J. Bacteriol. 116, 517-526] was found to carry structural genes for several 50S ribosomal proteins and 16S and 23S rRNA. It has previously been demonstrated [Kirschbaum & Scaife (1974) Mol. Gen. Genet. 132, 193-201] that this phage carries genes for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nucleosidetriphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.6) subunits beta and beta'. Thus, the region of the E. coli chromosome carried by lambdarifd18 contains a cluster of genes essential for transcription and translation.Images	Cluster of genes in Escherichia coli for ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA, and RNA polymerase subunits.

An Escherichia coli mutant, ts9, previously reported by Flaks et al. (Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 31, 623-631, 1966) to have an electrophoretically altered ribosomal protein, has been further characterized and the altered component has been identified as L7/L12. Although mutant ts9 is temperature sensitive for growth (rts-), the rts and L7/L12 mutations are genetically separable and are both located between argH and rif. The L7/L12 mutation (rpyL) maps very close to relC, mutants of which have a defect in the 50S ribosomal subunit. The gene order is argH-rts-(rpyL,relC)-rif. Protein synthesis directed by bacteriophage lambdacI857S7drifd18 in ultraviolet-irradiated cells indicates that L7/L12, As well as L1, L10, L11, and possibly L8 or L9 are coded by the phage DNA. Our results indicate that rpyL is the structural gene for L7/L12 and that this region of the E. coli chromosome contains a cluster of structural genes for ribosomal proteins.Images	New chromosomal location for structural genes of ribosomal proteins.

A structural gene for the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase (nucleosidetriphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.6) has been identified and mapped between spcA and trkA, near 64 min on the E. coli chromosome.

Two mutants of Escherichia coli K-12, defective in the oligopeptide and dipeptide transport system, are described. A mutant defective in the oligopeptide transport system (opp-1) was isolated as resistant to the inhibitory action of triornithine; this mutant is also resistant to glycylglycylvaline and does not concentrate 14C-glycylglycylglycine, although it is still as sensitive as the parental strain to glycylvaline and valine. Starting from the opp-1 strain, a mutant defective also in the dipeptide transport system (dpp-1) was isolated; this mutant is resistant to the inhibitory action of glycylvaline, valylleucine, and leucylvaline and does not concentrate 14C-glycylglycine, although it is still as sensitive as the parental strain to valine. The apparent kinetic constants for oligopeptide and dipeptide transport were measured. The opp marker is co-transducible with trp at 27 min on the E. coli genetic map. The dpp locus is separated from opp and is located between proC (10 min) and opp.Images	Escherichia coli K-12 Mutants Altered in the Transport Systems for Oligo- and Dipeptides	Maurilio De Felice, John Guardiola, Alessandro Lamberti, Maurizio Iaccarino	4126826	1973-11-01	9	
A temperature-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli has been found in which the conditional growth is a result of a thermosensitive glutaminyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase. The corresponding genetic locus glnS is cotransduced with lip. In a strain containing the mutationally altered glutaminyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, no derepression of the enzyme itself nor of glutamine synthetase was observed.

A series of colicin-tolerant (tol) mutants of Escherichia coli K-12, which adsorbed colicins but were not killed by them, were isolated and studied genetically and physiologically. Three major classes of mutants were found: tol II, tolerant to colicins A, E1, E2, E3, and K; tol III, tolerant to A, E2, E3, and K; and tol VIII, tolerant to E1 only. The sites of tol II and tol III mutations mapped near the gal region (gene order: tol-gal-bio) and were cotransduced with gal by P1. In heterozygous diploids, tol+ was dominant over tol; tol II and tol III gave full complementation. All the tol mutations that mapped near gal rendered the bacteria more fragile during growth and hypersensitive to deoxycholate and to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The tol VIII mutation mapped between str and his. These mutants were extremely sensitive to deoxycholate and were also hypersensitive to methylene blue, acridines, and various other compounds. The sensitivity is attributed to increased uptake due to selective alteration of the permeability barrier. The colicin-tolerant mutations are interpreted as affecting some components of the cytoplasmic membrane which mediate between the adsorbed colicin molecules and the target sites of their biochemical effects in the bacterial cell.

1. Two mutants of Escherichia coli K 12 were isolated which, although able to grow on glucose, are unable to grow with succinate or d-lactate as the sole source of carbon. 2. Genetic mapping of these mutants showed that they both contain a mutation in a gene (designated uncA) mapping at about minute 73.5 on the E. coli chromosome. 3. The uncA− alleles were transferred by bacteriophage-mediated transduction into another strain of E. coli and the transductants compared with the parent strain to determine the nature of the biochemical lesion in the mutants. 4. The mutants gave low aerobic growth yields when grown on limiting concentrations of glucose, but oxidase activities in membranes from both the mutants and the normal strain were similar. 5. Measurement of P/O ratios with d-lactate as substrate indicated that a mutation in the uncA gene causes uncoupling of phosphorylation associated with electron transport. 6. Determination of the Mg2+,Ca2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activities in the mutant and normal strains indicated that the uncA gene is probably the structural gene for Mg2+,Ca2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. 7. Mg2+,Ca2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase therefore appears to be essential for oxidative phosphorylation in E. coli.	Oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli K 12.

It was previously shown that the ochre suppressor mutation sup15B in Escherichia coli determines the accumulation of altered 30S ribosomal subunits and the presence of altered transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) capable of suppressing in vitro the UAG codon. This mutation has been mapped in the present study by means of conjugation and transduction experiments. After establishing the location of sup15B near argH, the following order was determined for the markers tested: metB-argH-(sup15B, supA36)-rif-thi. A comparison of location, growth rate, and suppressor pattern determined by sup15B and supM indicates the high probability that both suppressor mutations are identical. This study has also yielded a more precise location for the rifampin resistance gene. The most interesting finding is the very close (if not adjacent) location of the suppressor mutations sup15B and supA36, both of which determine tRNA alterations.

The ubiquinone precursors, 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, were isolated from ubiquinone-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Mutants accumulating 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone were shown to carry mutations in genes designated ubiE and ubiF, respectively. The ubiE gene was shown to be cotransducible with metE (minute 75) and close to two other genes concerned with ubiquinone biosynthesis. The ubiF gene was located close to minute 16 by cotransduction with the lip, gltA, and entA genes.

The pool of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan is formed in Escherichia coli K-12 by a general aromatic transport system [Michaelis constant (Km) for each amino acid approximately 5 × 10−7m] and three further transport systems each specific for a single aromatic amino acid (Km for each amino acid approximately 2 × 10−6m, reference 3). When the external concentration of a particular aromatic amino acid is saturating for both classes of transport system, the free amino acid pool is supplied with external amino acid by both systems. Blocking the general transport system reduces the pool size by 80 to 90% but does not interfere with the supply of the amino acid to protein synthesis. If, however, the external concentration is too low to saturate specific transport, blocking general transport inhibits the incorporation of external amino acid into protein by about 75%. It is concluded that the amino acids transported by either class of transport system can be used for protein synthesis. Dilution of the external amino acid or deprivation of energy causes efflux of the aromatic pool. These results and rapid exchange observed between pool amino acid and external amino acids indicate that the aromatic pool circulates rapidly between the inside and the outside of the cell. Evidence is presented that this exchange is mediated by the aromatic transport systems. Mutation of aroP (a gene specifying general aromatic transport) inhibits exit and exchange of the small pool generated by specific transport. These findings are discussed and a simple physiological model of aromatic pool formation, and exchange, is proposed.	Maintenance and Exchange of the Aromatic Amino Acid Pool in Escherichia coli	K. D.

The pleiotropic ctr mutation has been shown to affect tryptophan uptake and tryptophanase formation. Genetic reversions are of two types: (i) complete, restoring to wild type, located at 46 to 47 min; (ii) partial, restoring only tryptophanase synthesis, located at 73 min. In some strains the effect of ctr mutations could be reversed by cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) plus tryptophan. A mutant producing tryptophanase constitutively was suppressed by a ctr mutation. Production of tryptophanase in this suppressed strain was not restored by the addition of cAMP, but required cAMP plus tryptophan.

An ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive mutator gene, mutU, was identified in Escherichia coli K-12. The mutation mutU4 is very close to uvrD, between metE and ilv, on the E. coli chromosome. It was recessive as a mutator and as a UV-sensitive mutation. The frequency of reversion of trpA46 on an F episome was increased by mutU4 on the chromosome. The mutator gene did not increase mutation frequencies in virulent phages or in lytically grown phage λ. The mutU4 mutation predominantly induced transitional base changes. Mutator strains were normal for recombination and host-cell reactivation of UV-irradiated phage T1. They were normally resistant to methyl methanesulfonate and were slightly more sensitive to gamma irradiation than Mut+ strains. UV irradiation induced mutations in a mutU4 strain, and phage λ was UV-inducible. Double mutants containing mutU4 and recA, B, or C were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation; a mutU4 uvrA6 double mutant was only slightly more sensitive than a uvrA6 strain. The mutU4 uvrA6 and mutU4 recA, B, or C double mutants had mutation rates similar to that of a mutU4 strain. Two UV-sensitive mutators, mut-9 and mut-10, isolated by Liberfarb and Bryson in E. coli B/UV, were found to be co-transducible with ilv in the same general region as mutU4.

Attempts to transduce the ultraviolet-sensitive mutator lesion mutU4 into strains deficient in deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase I (polA) were unsuccessful. Mutator recombinants were found when the polA recipient had first been reverted to Pol+ by selection for resistance to methyl methanesulfonate. The inviability of the mutU4 polA double mutant was demonstrated by a reduction in the absolute number of transductants when the recipient was polA as compared with Pol+, and selection was made for markers very close to mutU4. Double mutants containing mutU4 and polA4, which determines a cold-sensitive polymerase, were unable to grow at 24 C, the nonpermissive temperature.

The Escherichia coli mutant hfl-1 is lysogenized at very high frequency by bacteriophage lambda. The normal requirement for the λcIII gene product in the establishment of repression is not observed in hfl-1 strains. These phenotypic characteristics are specified by a single locus at 82.5 min on the E. coli map in extremely close proximity to the purA gene, cotransduction frequencies ranging from 97 to 100% depending on the particular purA marker used. The lactose operon is shown to function normally in this strain, and there are also no demonstrable differences in ribonucleic acid polymerase activity or cyclic-adenosine monophosphate levels. Alterations in the cell envelope are indicated by a slight rifamycin resistance, which is reversible by pretreating the cells with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and by a resistance to penicillin and a sensitivity to high concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It is not known whether this change in cell surface is the primary lesion, or a pleiotropic effect of some more basic metabolic shift.

By using a new screening method, we have obtained 43 new Escherichia coli mutants defective in ring formation on galactose swarm plates, which score for defects in chemotaxis or transport. They were complemented and compared with mutations previously known to lie in the galactose-binding protein or the β-methylgalactoside (mgl) permease, or both. The mutations were all found to lie in three genes, called mglA, mglB, and mglC. mglB codes for the gene specifying the binding protein. Based on co-transduction experiments, mglA, mglB, and mglC lie close to each other on the bacterial chromosome.Images	Isolation and Complementation of Mutants in Galactose Taxis and Transport	George W.

β-Methylgalactoside (mgl) permease mutants of Escherichia coli, which are defective in three genes, mglA, mglB, and mglC, were assayed for galactose taxis and galactose transport. The mglB product is the galactose-binding protein. Previous evidence, supported by our new findings, shows that the galactose-binding protein is the recognition component for galactose taxis as well as for galactose transport. Most mutants defective in mglB showed strong effects on both chemotaxis and transport; however, a couple showed effects chiefly on one process or the other, thus allowing a separation of chemotaxis and transport. The mglA and mglC products have not yet been identified, but they must be components of the galactose transport machinery since mutants defective in mglA or mglC, or both, showed strongly reduced transport. Although some of these mutants showed little chemotaxis, most gave close to wild-type chemotactic responses. Thus, transport is not required for galactose taxis. The bacteria detect changes in the fraction of binding protein associated with galactose, not changes in the rate of transport.	Properties of Mutants in Galactose Taxis and Transport	George W.

2-Keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG), an intermediate of the hexuronate pathway in Escherichia coli K-12, is utilized as the sole carbon source only in strains derepressed for the specific KDG-uptake system. KDG is metabolized to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate via the inducible enzymes KDG-kinase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphate-gluconate (KDPG) aldolase. However, another inducible pathway, where the KDG is the branch point, has been demonstrated. Genetic studies of the KDG degradative pathway reported in this paper led to the location of KDG kinase-negative and pleiotropic constitutive mutations. The kdgK locus, presumably the structural gene of the kinase, occurs at min 69 and is co-transducible with xyl. The mutants, simultaneously constitutive for the uptake, kinase, and aldolase, define a kdgR locus at min 36 between the co-transducible markers kdgA and oldD. As to the nature of the control exerted by the kdgR product, we have shown the following. (i) Thermosensitive mutants of the kdgR locus are inducible at low temperature but derepressed at 42 C for the three operons—kdgT (transport system), kdgK, and kdgA (KDPG aldolase). (ii) The kdgR+ allele is dominant to the kdgR constitutive allele. (iii) A deletion in kdgA extending into the regulatory gene, kdgR, leads to a constitutive expression of the nondeleted operons—kdgT and kdgK. These properties demonstrate that the kdg regulon is negatively controlled by the kdgR product. It is presumed that differences in operator and in promotor structures could explain the strong decoordination, respectively, in the induction and catabolic repression, of these three enzymes activities.

Three genes, thrA, thrB, and thrC, were previously defined and localized in the threonine locus of Escherichia coli K-12. thrA, thrB, and thrC specify the enzymes aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I, homoserine kinase, and threonine synthetase, respectively. A complementation analysis of the threonine cluster using derivatives of a lambda phage carrying the threonine genes (λdthrc) demonstrates that: (i) thrB and thrC each consist of a single cistron; and (ii) thrA is composed of two cistrons, thrA1 and thrA2, although it specifies a single polypeptide chain. thrA1 and thrA2 correspond to aspartokinase I and homoserine dehydrogenase I, respectively. Their relative order is established. The demonstration of polar effects of mutations (nonsense or induced by phage Mu) in thrA and thrB is taken as evidence for the existence of a thrA thrB thrC operon, transcribed in this order.

A deletion has been isolated which fuses galK and presumably galT to the promoter and operator of the bioA operon. The deletion has endpoints in bioA and galE, and leaves the operator-proximal end of bioA intact and the regulatory sites themselves functional. In bacterial strains which carry the deletion, the expression of galK is regulated by biotin, although due to the inefficiency of the bioA promoter even the fully derepressed level of galactokinase is low. Electron micrographic examination of the mutation shows that it is a simple deletion, uncomplicated by other chromosomal abnormalities.Images	A Deletion Mutation Placing the Galactokinase Gene of Escherichia coli under Control of the Biotin Promoter	Gary Ketner, Allan Campbell	4368323	1974-07-01	9	
Mutant strains of Escherichia coli have been isolated in which the synthesis of two of the enzymes involved in tyrosine biosynthesis, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid-7 phosphate synthetase (tyr) and chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase, is partially constitutive. The mutations involved are closely linked to aroF and tyrA, the structural genes of these enzymes. The gene in which the mutations occur has been designated aroK, and the gene sequence is aroK, aroF, tyrA. In aroK+/aroK diploids, the aroK allele only affects the structural genes in the cis position. The mutant allele aroK is not recessive to aroK+ and aroK/aroK+ strains exhibit the aroK phenotype of resistance to 4-aminophenylalanine. It is proposed that aroK is an operator locus for an aroF tyrA operon.	Regulation of Tyrosine Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12: Isolation and Characterization of Operator Mutants	Ina E.

Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 were isolated in which the synthesis of the following, normally repressible enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis was constitutive: 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetases (phe and tyr), chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase, and transaminase A. In the wild type, DAHP synthetase (phe) was multivalently repressed by phenylalanine plus tryptophan, whereas DAHP synthetase (tyr), chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase, and transaminase A were repressed by tyrosine. DAHP synthetase (tyr) and chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase were also repressed by phenylalanine in high concentration (10−3m). Besides the constitutive synthesis of DAHP synthetase (phe), the mutants had the same phenotype as strains mutated in the tyrosine regulatory gene tyrR. The mutations causing this phenotype were cotransducible with trpA, trpE, cysB, and pyrF and mapped in the same region as tyrR at approximately 26 min on the chromosome. It is concluded that these mutations may be alleles of the tyrR gene and that synthesis of the enzymes listed above is controlled by this gene. Chorismate mutase P and prephenate dehydratase activities which are carried on a single protein were repressed by phenylalanine alone and were not controlled by tyrR. Formation of this protein is presumed to be controlled by a separate, unknown regulator gene. The heat-stable phenylalanine transaminase and two enzymes of the common aromatic pathway, 5-dehydroquinate synthetase and 5-dehydroquinase, were not repressible under the conditions studied and were not affected by tyrR. DAHP synthetase (trp) and tryptophan synthetase were repressed by tryptophan and have previously been shown to be under the control of the trpR regulatory gene. These enzymes also were unaffected by tyrR.	Repression of Aromatic Amino Acid Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12	K. D. Brown, R. L. Somerville	4399341	1971-10-01	9	
F-merogenotes derived from F14 by transductional shortening have previously been found to consist of the sex factor plus one or more of the ilv genes. It is shown here that they carry one or more ilv genes and a variable portion of the adjacent proximal ilv gene. This observation was used to develop a method, analogous to deletion mapping, for ordering mutant sites within the ilv genes. This method requires the use of a series of merogenotes each carrying an increasingly longer segment of the gene being mapped. A simplified method of fine-structure mapping is also described which requires only one or two F′ donor strains to map any one gene. This method is based on the large differences observed in recombination frequencies for mutant sites at various distances from the origin of the incomplete merogenote gene. The sequence of 25 mutant sites within three of the ilv genes was determined by use of the simplified procedure.

A recessive mutation (bir) of E. coli, at 77 min on the standard map, destroys ability of the bacteria to take up biotin or to grow except at high concentrations of biotin. In a biotin prototroph, the bir mutation causes overproduction and excretion of biotin, and derepression of at least one biosynthetic gene (bioD). Growth of the bir mutant is inhibited by avidin or high concentrations of dethiobiotin. Both effects are reversed by biotin.

Spontaneous mutants of Escherichia coli B/r resistant to 5′,5′,5′,-trifluoro-dl-leucine contain defects in a gene which maps to the left of the threonine region. Low-level constitutive expression of the isoleucine-valine and leucine operons is caused by this mutation in haploid strains. This is in contrast to extremely high levels of gene expression in the heterozygous merodiploids (F' wild type/mutant allele). The properties of these mutants define a new locus and suggest that it encodes a subunit protein which is involved in the repression of the structural genes for the branched-chain amino acid pathways.Images	New Amino Acid Regulatory Locus Having Unusual Properties in Heterozygous Merodiploids	Ellis L.

A mutant of Escherichia coli deficient in DNA polymerase II has been isolated from E. coli polA1 by mutagenesis with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and assay of polymerase activity in extracts of survivors. The polA1 mutation was suppressed during mutagenesis by introduction of the suppressor, su7+, into the parental strain. The mutant, HMS83 polA1 polB1, contains less than 0.5% of the normal levels of DNA polymerase II. The only polymerase activity detected in the mutant is DNA polymerase III. E. coli HMS83 grows normally at both 25 and 42°, and supports the growth of bacteriophages T4, T7, lambda, ϕX174, 186, P2, and fd. The polB mutation does not affect sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation or recombination frequencies.

Biotin independence in E. coli requires five closely linked genes, bioA, bioB, bioF, bioC, and bioD. The residual gene activity of deletion mutants has been studied by complementation and enzyme assays. Deletion of the left end of the bioA gene does not impair expression of the remaining genes, but deletions from the left extending into bioB abolish all gene expression. Nonsense mutations in bioB reduce expression of bioC, bioF, and bioD. Therefore, the four genes, bioB, bioF, bioC, and bioD, are transcribed as a unit from left to right, from a promotor located between bioA and bioB.Expression of the bio genes is repressible by added biotin. Deletions removing the left end of bioA do not affect repressibility of bioD. Therefore the operator, as well as the promoter, lie to the right of bioA. One deletion that removes bioA, bioB, and bioF renders the bioD gene constitutive, presumably by fusion to an unknown operon. Therefore, the operator lies to the left of bioC.

Genes for three enzymes of intermediary sugar metabolism in E. coli, zwf (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, constitutive), edd (gluconate 6-phosphate dehydrase, inducible), and eda (2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phosphate aldolase, differently inducible) are closely linked on the E. coli genetic map, the overall gene order being man... old... eda. edd. zwf... cheB... uvrC... his. One class of apparent revertants of an eda mutant strain contains a secondary mutation in edd, and some of these mutations are deletions extending into zwf. We have used a series of spontaneous edd-zwf deletions to map a series of point mutants in zwf and thus report the first fine structure map of a gene for a constitutive enzyme (zwf).

A collection of temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 was examined for ability to grow at the restrictive temperature when the osmotic pressure of the medium was increased. Five of the fourteen mutants were found to be osmotic remedial. Four strains containing temperature-sensitive, osmotic-remedial mutations affecting aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases were found to have altered permeability characteristics which may be attributable to changes in the lipopolysaccharide layer of the cell envelope at restrictive temperatures.

Temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 which cannot form cell wall peptidoglycan at 42 C were isolated. The thermosensitive steps were characterized biochemically, and the genes coding the enzymes of peptidoglycan synthesis were mapped. These genes were in two clusters: one group, located at about 1.5 min between leu and azi, was designated as mra (murein a); the second group, located at about 77.5 min close to argH and metB, was designated as mrb (murein b, with the order metB-argH-mrb). No simple relations were found between the gene location and the order or localization of enzymes involved in the sequence of reactions of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

A mutant of E. coli defective in DNA polymerase II activity was isolated. Extracts had about 0.1% of the normal activity of the DNA polymerase. The effect of the mutation on the ability of cells to replicate DNA of various sources was analyzed. Mutant bacteria grow normally, at 41° as well as at 30°. All bacteriophages, F factors, and R factors examined so far grow normally in the mutant. Sensitivity of the mutant to ultraviolet radiation and alkylating reagents in growth media was the same as that of the wild type.The mutation, polB1, is recessive with respect to wild type. The polB1 mutation can coexist with recombination-defective mutations. Genetic mapping studies show the mutation to be located at about 2 min on the E. coli map.

Three mutant strains of Escherichia coli have been isolated which are lacking ferric-enterochelin esterase activity. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the enterochelin moiety of ferric-enterochelin to yield ultimately three molecules of N-2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine. The mutants (designated fes−) were shown to be unaffected in enterochelin biosynthesis, capable of enterochelin-mediated iron uptake, and able to utilize ferric-dihydroxybenzoylserine complexes normally. When grown under iron-deficient conditions, however, they showed an absolute requirement for added iron or citrate, a phenotype characteristic of mutants defective in some part of the enterochelin system of iron uptake. These results support the theory that iron, taken up by the cell as ferric-enterochelin is only available for general cell metabolism after hydrolysis of the ligand by enterochelin esterase. The three fes− strains were shown to be affected in the B component of enterochelin esterase. The fesB gene which is probably the structural gene coding for component B of the esterase, was shown to be located at about minute 14 on the E. coli chromosome together with seven other genes involved in the enterochelin system of iron transport.

A cross-feeding technique was used to isolate a mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 that excretes 1,000 times more biotin into the growth medium than the parent strain. The mutant has high levels of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes even when grown in the presence of biotin. Desthiobiotin synthetase, the level of which was used as a measure of the biosynthetic activity of the biotin pathway, is not repressed by biotin at the concentration 250,000 times that sufficient to repress the enzyme in the wild type. The mutant gene is cotransducible with argC located at 77 min on the E. coli chromosome.Images	Mutant of Escherichia coli with Derepressed Levels of the Biotin Biosynthetic Enzymes	C. H.

A neomycin-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 unable to grow on Krebs cycle intermediates has been isolated.

Fructose-6-phosphate kinase (pfkA) mutants have impaired growth on carbon sources which enter glycolysis at or above the level of fructose-6-phosphate, but the degree of impairment depends on the carbon source (e.g., growth on glucose is very much slower than growth on glucose-6-phosphate). The present report contains considerable data on this complicated growth phenotype and derives mainly from the finding of a class of partial revertants which grow as fast on glucose as on glucose-6-phosphate; the reversion mutation is shown to be constitutivity of the glyoxylate shunt (iclRc). iclRc does not increase the fructose-6-phosphate kinase level in the mutants, and the exact mechanism of the partial phenotypic suppression is not understood. However, iclRc was already known to suppress some mutations which affected phosphoenolpyruvate levels, and H. L. Kornberg and J. Smith have suggested (1970) that the growth phenotype of pfkA mutants might be related to pathways of phosphoenolpyruvate formation. Surprisingly, the hexose-monophosphate shunt is not necessary for the suppression, which therefore must act to restore metabolism via the residual phosphofructokinase activity present in all pfkA mutants. A mutant totally lacking phosphofructokinase activity was not suppressed.

Escherichia coli strain K28, isolated after nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, was found to be auxotrophic for serine. It was also temperature sensitive for growth as a result of producing an altered seryl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (EC 6.1.1.11, l-serine: tRNA ligase [AMP]). The auxotrophy was caused by a mutation in the structural gene for phosphohydroxy-pyruvate transaminase (serC), which was distinct from, but closely linked to, the structural gene for seryl-tRNA synthetase (serS). We conclude that the relevant genes are in the order gal-serS-serC-aroA.

From Escherichia coli strain K28, which is temperature sensitive for growth because of a mutation in its seryl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase gene (serS), temperature-resistant mutants were selected which were found to have a fivefold higher level of seryl-tRNA synthetase than the parent strain. The “high-level” character was found to be genetically stable and is due to a mutation in a locus denoted serO. This locus was found to be very closely linked to serS on the genetic map, and the relative gene order was concluded to be serS-serO-serC. In a serO− strain, the normal dependence of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) activity on changes of exogenous serine concentration was not observed. In a stable heterozygous merodiploid, the serO− mutation is still expressed, i.e., it is cis dominant. These results strongly suggest that serO is an operator site involved in the control of the serS gene.

The activity of acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, an essential enzyme for isoleucine and valine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, was examined in a series of mutants containing derepressed levels of acetohydroxy acid synthetase activity but which differed from each other in the sensitivity of the synthetases to valine inhibition. The finding that isomeroreductase was highest in the strain with the synthetase that was least sensitive to valine inhibition supported the model of internal induction of the isomeroreductase by its acetohydroxy acid substrates. The mutation leading to the acetohydroxy acid synthetase least sensitive to valine was found to be unlinked to the ilv gene cluster and appeared to result in a synthetase that differed from the normal enzyme in several properties. The locus of this mutation is designated ilvF. The loci leading to derepression were designated azl. A pleiotropic, apparently single-step, mutation was found that led to restoration of end-product sensitivity to the synthetase, loss of end-product sensitivity of threonine deaminase [EC 4.2.1.16, l-threonine hydro-lyase (deaminating) and loss of isomeroreductase activity.

The ilvC gene product, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, an enzyme essential for isoleucine and valine formation, is subject to substrate induction in Escherichia coli. We have isolated a mutant of E. coli K-12 with a mutation that renders the ilvC gene product noninducible by its substrates, the acetohydroxy acids. This mutation, ilvY466, has been shown to be in a previously undiscovered locus that lies between ilvC and ilvO. The ilvY product, upsilon, is thought to be a regulatory element involved in the induction of ilvC. We postulate the recognition site, ilvQ, or upsilon and suggest that it lies between ilvC and ilvB. A possible model, involving upsilon, in the positive control of isomeroreductase is presented. Pleiotropic effects of the ilvY466 mutation have been recognized from changes in the end-product inhibition of threonine deaminase and of acetohydroxy acid synthetase. In addition, pleiotropic effects of this lesion on the regulation of threonine deaminase and the physical properties of threonine deaminase and acetohydroxy acid synthetase have been observed.

Seven ubiquinone-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli, each of which accumulates two phenolic precursors of ubiquinone, have been characterized, and the accumulated compounds have been identified. The mutants accumulate small quantities of 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol, which was isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, and relatively large amounts of 2-octaprenylphenol, a compound previously identified from E. coli. They also accumulate small quantities of a compound identified as 2-(hydroxyoctaprenyl)phenol although the relevance of this compound to the biosynthesis of ubiquinone is not clear. The results of genetic analysis suggest that each of the mutants carries a mutation in a gene (designated ubiH) which is located at about min 56 on the E. coli chromosome and is co-transducible with the serA and lysB genes. Based on information obtained from this and previous studies with ubiquinone-deficient mutants, a pathway is proposed for ubiquinone biosynthesis in E. coli, and a summary of the known gene-enzyme relationships is given.

A mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 that does not ferment gluconate on fermentation plates was isolated and characterized. This mutant, designated M2, shows a long lag for growth on gluconate mineral medium and somewhat reduced levels of high-affinity transport, gluconokinase, and gluconate-6-P dehydrase activities in the log phase of growth. The mutation involved is near malA. Deletion mutants in which malA region was affected were also studied. They were found to affect the function of different genes involved in gluconate metabolism.

Escherichia coli produces two enzymes which interconvert succinate and fumarate: succinate dehydrogenase, which is adapted to an oxidative role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fumarate reductase, which catalyzes the reductive reaction more effectively and allows fumarate to function as an electron acceptor in anaerobic growth. A glycerol plus fumarate medium was devised for the selection of mutants (frd) lacking a functional fumarate reductase by virtue of their inability to use fumarate as an anaerobic electron acceptor. Most of the mutants isolated contained less than 1% of the parental fumarate reduction activity. Measurements of the fumarate reduction and succinate oxidation activities of parental strains and frd mutants after aerobic and anaerobic growth indicated that succinate dehydrogenase was completely repressed under anaerobic conditions, the assayable succinate oxidation activity being due to fumarate reductase acting reversibly. Fumarate reductase was almost completely repressed under aerobic conditions, although glucose relieved this repression to some extent. The mutations, presumably in the structural gene (frd) for fumarate reductase, were located at approximately 82 min on the E. coli chromosome by conjugation and transduction with phage P1. frd is very close to the ampA locus, and the order of markers in this region was established as ampA-frd-purA.

The d-serine transport system in Escherichia coli K-12 was studied by use of a mutant unable to form d-serine deaminase, yet resistant to d-serine. The mutant is greatly impaired in its ability to accumulate d-serine, d-alanine, and glycine. Transport of l-alanine is partially affected but transport of l-serine is unaffected. The mutant is also resistant to d-cycloserine, indicating that d-serine is transported by the system responsible for uptake of d-cycloserine. The d-serine transport system is not inducible, but appears to be formed constitutively, as are the transport systems of most amino acids. The transport mutation appears to be multistep and maps to the right of malB on the E. coli linkage map.	d-Serine Transport System in Escherichia coli K-121	Sharon D. Cosloy	4574696	1973-05-01	9	
Escherichia coli mutants that are insensitive to colicins B and I hyperproduce and excrete the iron chelator enterochelin, which is an inhibitor of these colicins. These mutants are classified as exbA and exbB. The exbA mutants are chromium sensitive and require iron for growth, and the mutations are located in the tonB region at min 25 of the E. coli chromosome. tonB mutants in which the genome of phage lambda is inserted into the bacterial chromosome within the tonB gene also exhibit enterochelin excretion. The exbB mutants require methionine and probably result from deletions which are located between min 56 and 58. Colicin insensitivity, enterochelin excretion and methionine auxotrophy are recessive in exbB merodiploids. The methionine requirement of exbB strains is satisfied by cystathionine or homocysteine, and exbB mutants are sensitive to ethionine.

A morphological mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 that grows as round cells at 30, 37, or 42 C in a variety of complex and synthetic media has been isolated and characterized. The gene concerned, designated rodA, has been shown to be on the chromosome between the purE and pyrC loci and to be located at about minute 15. The rodA gene has been found to be co-transducible with the lip gene at a frequency of 95%. The rodA mutant showed an increased resistance to ultraviolet irradiation and a changed sensitivity to drugs. The resistance to ultraviolet irradiation and mitomycin C appears to be co-transducible with the rodA gene.Images	Characterization and Genetic Analysis of a Mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 with Rounded Morphology	Hiroshi Matsuzawa, Kou Hayakawa, Tetsuji Sato, Kazutomo Imahori	4577747	1973-07-01	9	
The chromosomal location of two genetic loci involved in the transport of cyanocobalamin (B12) in Escherichia coli K-12 was determined. One gene, btuA, is believed to code for the transport protein in the cytoplasmic membrane, because a mutant with an alteration in this gene has lost the ability to accumulate B12 within the cell although normal levels of the surface receptors for B12 are present. The other locus, btuB, apparently codes for the surface receptor on the outer membrane. These mutants have lost the ability to bind B12 and have greatly reduced transport activity, although growth experiments have shown that they can utilize B12 for growth, but with decreased efficiency. This surface receptor for B12 also appears to function as the receptor for the E colicins, because btuB mutants are resistant to the E colicins, and mutants selected for resistance to colicin E1 are defective in B12 binding and transport. The gene order was determined by transduction analysis to be cyc-argH-btuA-btuB-rif-purD. In addition, mutations in metH, the gene for the B12-dependent homocysteine methylating enzyme, were obtained in this study. This gene was localized between metA and malB.

A spontaneous amber tyrR mutant has been isolated in which constitutive synthesis of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase (tyr) and DAHP synthetase (phe) is suppressible by supC−, supD−, supF− and supU−. This finding suggests the tyrR gene product is a protein. Derepression of DAHP synthetase (phe) in this and in seven other spontaneous tyrR mutants and in four Mu-1-induced tyrR mutants provides further evidence for the involvement of the tyrR gene product in phenylalanine biosynthesis. Evidence that the tyrR product is a component of repressor, rather than an enzyme involved in its synthesis or modification, comes from a study of a temperature-sensitive tyrR mutant. This mutant is of the thermolabile type, since derepression occurs rapidly and in the presence and absence of growth.

The tolE mutation causes tolerance to colicins E2 and E3 as well as other effects on the phenotype of Escherichia coli K-12. The lipopolysaccharide of the mutant shows a reduction in the content of galactose, glucose, and rhamnose. The phenotype of the mutant, including the composition of the lipopolysaccharide, is suppressed by galactose. The map position is shown by the gene order trp-purB-tolE-tolD-galKETO.

Three kinds of control mechanisms govern the expression of the members of the glp regulon for glycerol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) catabolism in Escherichia coli K-12: specific repression by the product of the glpR gene; catabolite repression; and respiratory repression (the effect exerted by exogenous hydrogen acceptors). The operons of the glp system show different patterns of response to each control. By growing in parallel a mutant strain with temperature-sensitive repressor (glpRts) and an isogenic control with a deletion in the regulator gene at progressively higher temperatures, it was possible to show that the synthesis of aerobic G3P dehydrogenase (glpD product) is far more sensitive to specific repression than that of either glycerol kinase (glpK product) or G3P transport (glpT product). Conversely, in the strain with a deletion in the regulator gene, the syntheses of glycerol kinase and G3P transport are more sensitive to catabolite repression than that of the aerobic G3P dehydrogenase. The levels of the two flavoprotein G3P dehydrogenases vary in opposite directions in response to changes of exogenous hydrogen acceptors. For example, the ratio of the aerobic enzyme to the anaerobic enzyme (specified by glpA) is high when molecular oxygen or nitrate serves as the hydrogen acceptor and low when fumarate plays this role. This trend is not influenced by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate to the growth medium. Thus, respiratory repression most likely involves a third mechanism of control, independent of specific or catabolite repression.

At least two transport systems serve for the entry of alanine, glycine, and serine into Escherichia coli. One of these systems serves mainly for glycine, d-alanine, and d-serine and to some extent for l-alanine, whereas the second serves for l-alanine and perhaps l-serine. These two transport systems have been characterized by kinetic studies and by inhibition analysis. Reciprocal plots for l-alanine entry are distinctly biphasic, giving rise to Km values of about 2 and 27 μM. The major route of glycine entry can be described by a single Km value of about 4 μM. A higher Km value for glycine of around 70 to 100 μM shows that other routes of entry may serve at high concentrations of amino acid. The glycine, d-serine and d-alanine transport system is defective in a d-serine-resistant mutant, strain EM1302. The mutation, dagA, is recessive in dagA/dagA+ merodiploids and is 7 to 12% linked by phage P1 transduction to the pyrB locus of E. coli. E. coli with the dagA mutation are unable to utilize d-alanine as a carbon source, providing an additional basis for selecting such mutants. The remaining l-alanine uptake in dagA mutants is subject to inhibition by l-serine, l-threonine, and l-leucine. It is also sensitive to osmotic shock treatment and repressed by growth of the cells on l-leucine. It appears from a comparison of the properties of the second l-alanine system with those of the leucine, isoleucine, and valine system (LIV system) that the LIV system also serves for the transport of l-alanine and l-threonine and perhaps l-serine.

A heat-inducible lysis-defective λ prophage has been integrated directly into the E. coli chromosome at a site (bfe) very closely linked to the ribonucleic acid polymerase mutation rifd, a dominant rifampin resistance allele.

The transport of l-methionine into cells of Escherichia coli is described. The transported methionine undergoes a fairly rapid conversion to other cellular metabolites, primarily polyamines, but within 2 min, at least 65% of the intracellular label remains as methionine. The uptake process, which is temperature dependent, allows the accumulation of methionine against a concentration gradient. The dependence of the initial rate of uptake on the extracellular substrate concentration indicates the presence of multiple transport systems, whose kinetic behavior can be approximated by two systems, one with KT = 7.5 × 10−8 M and VT = 200 pmol per μliter of cell water per min, and the other with KT = 40 × 10−6 M and VT = 1,550 pmol per μliter per min. Both systems are highly specific for l-methionine. Methionine derivatives substituted on the amino or carboxyl group were somewhat effective as inhibitors of l-methionine uptake, whereas d-methionine, ethionine, or other amino acids were poorly inhibitory, if at all. The uptake process is dependent on metabolic energy, but apparently this energy can be derived either from glycolysis or from oxidative phosphorylation. Efflux of methionine was demonstrable, and both the influx and efflux process were susceptible to inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. The intracellular pool of l-methionine was estimated to be 0.1 to 0.3 mM. The transport in two mutant strains defective in methionine uptake (metD and metP) showed that the high-affinity transport system was lost, whereas the low-affinity system remained more or less intact.

Three ubiquinone-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli unable to convert 4-hydroxybenzoate into 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate were isolated and examined. The results of genetic analysis suggest that each of the mutants carries a mutation in a gene designated ubiA which can be represented at minute 79 on the E. coli chromosome map. The conversion of 4-hydroxybenzoate into 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, catalyzed by 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase, was studied with a strain of E. coli that is blocked in the common pathway of aromatic biosynthesis and consequently accumulates the precursor of the side chain of ubiquinone. Both the side-chain precursor and 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase were shown to be membrane-bound. The enzyme required Mg2+ for optimal activity. The ubiA− mutants were found to lack 4-hydroxybenozate octaprenyltransferase activity, which suggested that the ubiA gene is the structural gene coding for this enzyme.

Uptake of isoleucine, leucine, and valine in Escherichia coli K-12 is due to several transport processes for which kinetic evidence has been reported elsewhere. A very-high-affinity transport process, a high-affinity transport process, and three different low-affinity transport processes were described. In this paper the existence of these transport processes is confirmed by the isolation and preliminary characterization of mutants altered in one or more of them. The very-high-affinity transport process is missing either in strains carrying the brnR6am mutation or in strains carrying the brn-8 mutation. This appears to be a pleiotropic effect since other transport systems are also missing. Mutant analysis shows that more than one transport system with high affinity is present. One of them, high-affinity 1, which needs the activity of a protein produced by the brnQ gene, transports isoleucine, leucine, and valine and is unaffected by threonine. The other, high-affinity 2, which needs the activity of a protein produced by the brnS gene, transports isoleucine, leucine, and valine; this uptake is inhibited by threonine which probably is a substrate. Another protein, produced by the brnR gene, is required for uptake through both high-affinity 1 and high-affinity 2 transport systems. The two systems therefore appear to work in parallel, brnR being a branching point. The brnQ gene is located close to phoA at 9.5 min on the chromosome of E. coli, the brnR gene is located close to lac at 9.0 min, and the brnS gene is close to pdxA at 1 min. A mutant lacking the low-affinity transport system for isoleucine was isolated from a strain in which the high-affinity system was missing because of a brnR mutation. This strain also required isoleucine for growth because of an ilvA mutation. The mutant lacking the low-affinity transport system was unable to grow on isoleucine but could grow on glycylisoleucine. This mutant had lost the low-affinity transport for isoleucine, whereas those for leucine and valine were unaffected. A pleiotropic consequence of this mutation (brn-8) was a complete absence of the very-high-affinity transport system due either to the alteration of a common gene product or to any kind of secondary interference which inhibits it. Mutants altered in isoleucine-leucine-valine transport were isolated by taking advantage of the inhibition that valine exerts on the K-12 strain of E. coli. Mutants resistant both to valine inhibition (Valr) and to glycylvaline inhibition are regulatory mutants. Valr mutants that are sensitive to glycylvaline inhibition are transport mutants. When the very-high-affinity transport process is repressed (for example by methionine) the frequency of transport mutants among Valr mutants is higher, and it is even higher if the high-affinity transport process is partially inhibited by leucine.

The control mutation that results in a concomitant severalfold increase in the activities of γ-aminobutyrate-α-ketoglutarate transaminase (GSST, EC 2.6.1.19) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSDH, EC 1.2.1.16), leading to the acquisition of the ability to utilize γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) as the sole source of nitrogen by Escherichia coli K-12 mutants, was mapped by mating and transduction with P1kc. The locus affected, gabC, is approximately 48% co-transduced with the thyA gene, located at min 55 of the E. coli K-12 chromosome. The structural gene of the first enzyme in the GABA pathway, GSST, was mapped by interrupted mating, using one of the GSST-less mutants, DB742, isolated in this work. The mutated locus, gabT, is situated at about min 73 of the E. coli chromosome, close to the gltC gene. Genetic evidence concerning the sensitivity of the enzymes of the GABA pathway to catabolite repression under different physiological conditions suggests that the two structural genes of the GABA regulon do not constitute one operon.

Interrupted mating experiments were performed with Hfr strains H and C and three leu lac purE recipient strains derived from a common parent and carrying, respectively, the proA−, proB−, and proC− mutations. It was concluded that if leu is placed at 1.5 min and purE at 12 min from thr, the origin on the Taylor-Trotter map, lac is at about 7.5 min and the pro genes are at about 6.0, 6.6, and 8.4 min, respectively. Both conjugational and transductional data suggest that the strain carrying the proB− mutation also carries a second mutation close to the proA site which independently confers a Pro− phenotype. The times before the onset of transfer of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid by both Hfr strains B4 and B8 were approximately 3 min.

Hfr strains B4 and B8 transfer the Escherichia coli chromosome in opposite directions, each transferring lac+ as the last known marker. They were mated in concurrent crosses with the proA leu metE lys trp purE lac strain χ462. Analysis of the time of entry values for these markers showed that Hfr strain B8 transfers the whole chromosome more rapidly than does Hfr strain B4. In both crosses, the rate of transfer observed decelerates. If deceleration occurs as a function of the amount of chromosome transferred, the data are consistent with the markers examined being very accurately placed on the Taylor-Trotter map of the E. coli K-12 genome.

Four cold-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli, which have defects in the maturation of the 50S ribosomal subunit, were isolated. Each of the mutations was shown to map at a different locus. The loci were assigned the name rim (ribosome maturation) and were shown to map as follows: rimA is co-transduced with ilvD and with pyrE; rimB is co-transduced with aroD; conjugation experiments limited rimD to a region between ilv and malB, and conjugation experiments limited rimC to the 22 to 30 min region of the chromosome. In merodiploids heterozygous for rimA, rimB, or rimD, the wild-type allele was shown to be dominant to the mutant allele. The observation that the rim loci lie outside the strA region and separate from each other, as well as the recessive character of the rim loci, suggests that the mutants may be defective in ribosome maturation factors rather than being defective in ribosomal structural proteins.

The inner membrane fractions of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically and aerobically were isolated, and their proteins were compared by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. To maximimize the differences between the preparations, the anaerobic cultures were grown on complex medium with added glucose, but glucose was omitted from the aerobic cultures to prevent catabolite repression. The pattern of bands in the two types of preparation differed considerably, and changes in approximately 20 components were observed. In particular, the band identified as succinate dehydrogenase in aerobic preparations was greatly reduced in anaerobic preparations. Mutants lacking fumarate reductase were isolated, and inner membrane preparations of an frd amber mutant were deficient in a major component of 75,000 daltons and possibly a minor one of 87,500 daltons. The former was also present in greater amounts in anaerobic preparations and could represent a fumarate reductase subunit.Images	Proteins of the Inner Membrane of Escherichia coli: Changes in Composition Associated with Anaerobic Growth and Fumarate Reductase Amber Mutation	Margaret E.

A mutant strain of Escherichia coli unable to carry out the first specific reaction of ubiquinone biosynthesis, that is the conversion of chorismate into 4-hydroxybenzoate, has been isolated. The gene concerned maps at about minute 79 on the E. coli chromosome and has been designated ubiC. This gene is probably the structural gene for chorismate lyase since cell extracts from a transductant strain carrying the ubiC437 mutant allele are unable to convert chorismate into 4-hydroxybenzoate and growing cells of the mutant do not form appreciable quantities of ubiquinone unless 4-hydroxybenzoate is added to the growth medium.

The structural gene for the biosynthetic l-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been mapped at min 71.5 on the Escherichia coli chromosome. This gene (gpsA) is co-transduced with the xyl, mtl, and pyrE loci. Three-factor conjugational crosses and the transduction data indicate that the order of loci in this region of the chromosone is mtl, gltE, gpsA, gadR, gadS, pyrE. Study of a temperature-sensitive gpsA mutant possessing a dehydrogenase of increased thermolability indicated that gpsA is the structural gene for the dehydrogenase. All dehydrogenase-deficient strains tested were mapped very close to the gpsA locus. Attempts at genetic complementation analysis were unsuccessful.

cca Mutants of Escherichia coli K12 have altered levels of tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase activity. The cca locus has been located at minute 59.4 of the E. coli linkage map. It is cotransduced with tolC but not with argG, and is the earliest known marker transferred by Hfr strain KL14. The proximity of the tolC locus to the integrated sex factor in Hfr strain KL14 may be useful for mapping sex factor mutations by transduction.

The conversion of ϕX174 single-stranded DNA to duplex DNA by extracts of E. coli requires products of the E. coli DNA replication genes. By use of this complementation system, the dna C gene product has been purified from wild-type E. coli as well as from a dna C temperature-sensitive mutant. The latter preparations are temperature sensitive when compared to the wild-type gene product. The dna C and dna D gene products copurify, have similar characteristics, are both temperature sensitive in preparations from dna C temperature-sensitive cells, and are both undetectable in preparations from dna D temperature-sensitive cells.

"A temperature-sensitive DNA replication mutant of E. coli K-12 was isolated among the mutants selected for phenethyl alcohol resistance at low temperatures. This mutation, designated as dnaP18, affects sensitivity of the cell to phenethyl alcohol, sodium deoxycholate and rifampicin, presumably due to an alteration in the membrane structure. At high temperatures (e.g., 42°), synthesis of DNA, but not RNA or protein, is arrested, leading to the formation of ""filaments"" in which no septum formation is apparent. Nucleoids observed under electron microscope seem to become dispersed and DNA fibrils less condensed, which may explain the loss of viability under these conditions. Genetic analyses, including reversion studies, indicate that a recessive dnaP mutation located between cya and metE on the chromosome is responsible for both alterations of the membrane properties and temperature sensitivity. The dnaP18 mutation does not affect growth of phage T4 or lambda under conditions where host DNA replication is completely inhibited. Kinetic studies of DNA replication and cell division in this mutant after the temperature shift from 30 to 42°, and during the subsequent recovery at 30°, accumulated evidence suggesting that DNA replication comes to a halt at 42° upon completion of a cycle already initiated before the temperature shift. Since the recovery of DNA synthesis after exposure to 42° does not depend on protein or RNA synthesis or other energy-requiring processes, the product of the mutant dnaP gene appears to be reversibly inactivated at 42°. Taken together with the recessive nature of the present mutation, it was suggested that one of the membrane proteins involved in initiation of DNA replication is affected in this mutant."

The dnaH locus is the fourth gene to be identified as required for deoxyribonucleic acid polymerization in Escherichia coli. A temperature-sensitive mutant defective in this gene exhibited an abrupt decrease in rate of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis when shifted to 42 C. The locus mapped in the proC-purE region of the chromosome by conjugation and was co-transducible with purE. dnaH+ is carried on the F′13 episome and is dominant over the dnaH− mutation.Images	Bacterial Cell Division Regulation: Characterization of the dnaH Locus of Escherichia coli	Camille C.

An Escherichia coli K-12 mutant deficient for detergent-resistant (DR) phospholipase A, a principal enzyme catalyzing the first step in phospholipid degradation, was characterized genetically. The mutation was found to affect the locus pldA (phospholipid degradation), which is cotransducible both with ilv and metE at a frequencies of 13 and 78%, respectively, and shown to lie between the ilv and metE loci on the E. coli chromosome. DR phospholipase A1 and A2 activities were simultaneously transduced with pldA+ by phage P1; therefore it is proposed that DR phospholipase A has both activities.

Two classes of spontaneous colicin I insensitive mutants of Escherichia coli have been isolated. The first class (called cir) has lost its ability to adsorb either colicin Ia or Ib, maps at 41 min on the E. coli genetic map, and retains sensitivity to all other colicins tested. The cir phenotype is probably due to an alteration in the colicin I receptor. The second class of mutant (called tolI) retains full capacity to adsorb [125I]colicin I and, therefore, represents the isolation of a mutant tolerant to colicin I. The tolI mutant is sensitive to all other colicins tested and has a map location of 89-1 min. The tolI mutant grows with a reduced mass yield when glucose is used as a carbon source and cannot utilize succinate or acetate for growth. The tolI mutant shows a reduced sensitivity to sodium azide and phenethylalcohol. It is suggested that tolI is deficient in some aspect of aerobic metabolism which must be operative for colicin I sensitivity.

At least two transport systems serve for the entry of l-methionine into Escherichia coli. One of these systems has a high affinity for methionine (KT of about 10−7 M) and is inhibited by methionyl peptides. The other system has a lower affinity (KT of 40 μM). Mutants defective in metD lack the high-affinity system and are unable to utilize d-methionine or N-acetylmethionine as methionine sources. A mutant was isolated which not only lacks the high-affinity system, but which also exhibits decreased activity of the low-affinity system. The transport parameters of the activity remaining in this strain were measured. The energy source for transport appears to be the same as that in the parental strain. The loss of the transport activities was not accompanied by major changes in the methionine pool size or in the rate of methionine excretion or synthesis. The analysis of revertants and transduction crosses supports the conclusion that the strain described is a double mutant in both metD (which codes for the high-affinity system) and metP (the low-affinity system). The metD locus was found to lie between tonA (38% co-transduction) and proA (9% co-transduction).

A mutant of Escherichia coli temperature-sensitive for deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, dnaD, was found to have temperature-sensitive modification and restriction phenotypes. In contrast to the original observation by Carl (1970), the mutant could support the growth of λ phage at 41 C. However, the λ phages thus produced were able to form plaques with normal plating efficiency only on E. coli C, a restriction-less strain, but not on E. coli K. Since the λ phages produced in the mutant at 30 C could form plaques equally well on both E. coli strains, it was concluded that the dnaD mutant has a temperature-sensitive modification phenotype. Furthermore, since the dnaD mutant allowed some growth of unmodified λ·C phages at 41 C but less at 30 C, the mutant is also temperature sensitive in restriction. The relationship, if any, between temperature-sensitive deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and temperature-sensitive modification-restriction in the dnaD mutant is not known. Similar experiments were done with three dnaC mutants and one dnaA mutant. Two dnaC mutants were found to have altered restriction phenotypes at 41 C, but none of the mutants were defective in modification.

Six of seven hfl mutations of Escherichia coli K12, characterized by high frequencies of lysogenization by phage lambda and λcIII mutants, are shown to be tightly linked to, but not within, the purA locus. All six hfl mutations are recessive to wild type in hfl+/hfl merodiploids and all lie in a single complementation group, located just counterclockwise from the purA locus. All six mutations confer a slightly increased resistance to penicillin and rifamycin and a slightly increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Some cases of intragenic complementation and intragenic recombination were observed. It is argued that the hfl+ gene determines the synthesis of a protein which antagonizes lysogenization by phage lambda. It is further argued that the function of the λcIII gene product is to negate the antagonistic effect of this hfl+ protein.

Three mutations (ilvH611, ilvH612, and ilvH613) are described which make Escherichia coli K-12 resistant to valine inhibition and are located near leu. The expression of the ilv genes appears to be normal in these mutants since the isoleucine-valine biosynthetic enzymes are not derepressed relative to the wild type. The intracellular concentration of valine is, however, higher in the mutants than in the isogenic ilvH+ strain. These mutants also excrete valine, probably because of the high intracellular concentration of this amino acid. The pool size of valine is regulated independently from that of isoleucine and leucine. The increased intracellular concentration of valine is due to a decreased feedback inhibition that valine exerts on its own biosynthetic pathway. In fact, acetolactate synthase activity assayed in extracts of ilvH612 and ilvH613 mutants is more resistant to valine inhibition than the activity assayed in the ilvH+ isogenic strain. Two forms of acetolactate synthase activity can be separated from these extracts by adsorption and elution on hydroxylapatite. One of them is as sensitive to valine inhibition as that of the wild type, the other is more resistant to valine inhibition.

Evidence is reported that shows the presence in Escherichia coli K-12 of a newly found acetolactate synthase. This enzyme is the product of two genes, ilvH and ilvI, both located very close to leu. Amber mutations have been found in both genes and therefore their products are polypeptides. Mutations in the ilvH gene cause the appearance of an acetolactate synthase activity which is relatively resistant to valine inhibition and can be separated by adsorption on hydroxylapatite from another activity present in the extract and more sensitive to valine inhibition than the former. A mutant altered in the ilvI gene was isolated among the revertants sensitive to valine inhibition of an ilvH mutant. Such a mutant lacks the resistant acetolactate synthase. A temperature-sensitive revertant of the ilvI mutant contained a temperature-sensitive acetolactate synthase. Thus ilvI is the structural gene for a specific acetolactate synthase. The activity of the ilvH gene product has been measured by adding an extract containing it to a purified ilvI acetolactate synthase, which, upon incubation, became more sensitive to valine inhibition. Conversely, a valine-sensitive acetolactate synthase (the product of the ilvH and the ilvI genes) became more resistant to valine inhibition upon incubation with an extract of a strain containing a missense ilvH gene product.

In Escherichia coli wild-type cells, a mutation at the β-glucoside regulatory gene (bglR+ to bglR−) leads to simultaneous expression of inducible phospho-β-glucosidase B (bglB+) and a β-glucoside-specific species of enzyme II (β-glucoside transport I [bglC+]); an additional mutation (bglS+ to bglS4) allows these enzymes to be formed constitutively. The bgl alleles have been mapped in the following order: pyrE, bglA, bglB, bglS, bglR, bglC, ilvD. The back mutation in the regulatory allele (bglR− to bglR+) caused the cessation of the expression of the bglB+, bglS+ or bglS4, bglC+ alleles. However, a mutation in a strain with bglB+, bglS4, bglR8, bglC+ alleles, at the ini site that lies between the bglS4 and the bglR8 allele, allowed the expression of the bglS4 and bglB+ alleles, but showed no affect on the expression of the bglC+ allele. It is suggested that the ini mutation possesses a promotor-type function that in the absence of regulatory allele function (bglR8) renews the functioning of only the bglS4 and bglB+ alleles. The complementation studies have shown that the bglB+, bglS+ or bglS4, bglC+ alleles are expressed only in cis to the bglR− allele. In the constitutive strain (bglB+, bglS4, bglR−, bglC+), the expressed bglS4 allele formed a soluble product that acts in trans over the bglB+ and bglC+ alleles and that appears effective only when the bglB+ and the bglC+ alleles are expressed in cis to the bglR− allele. It thus showed that the constitutive biosynthesis of phospho-β-glucosidase B and β-glucoside transport I is under positive control. Since the regulatory allele bglR− lies between the bglS4 and the blgC+ alleles, and acts in cis, it appears that the mutation (bglR+ to bglR−) allows the initiation of transcription in one direction to express the bglS4, bglB+ alleles and in the other to express the bglC+ allele. The structural genes bglB and bglC lie adjacent to the regulatory genes bglR and bglS, and the structural genes are coordinately controlled by the regulatory genes. It is, therefore, proposed that the bglB, bglS, bglR, bglC genes form a bgl operon.	Regulation of the β-Glucoside System in Escherchia coli K-12	Ishwari Prasad, Sam Schaefler	4616943	1974-11-01	9

Colicin-tolerant mutants of Escherichia coli K-12, which map near gal at 17 min (tolA, B mutants), have been isolated and characterized. These mutants exhibited a very broad spectrum of phenotypic changes consistent with the interpretation that they are cell surface mutants. In addition to being colicintolerant and sensitive to deoxycholate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tolA, B mutants are sensitive to vancomycin, bacitracin, and dodecyl sulfate. The tolA, B mutants from most strains also formed mucoid colonies at 30 C on nutrient agar plates and had a greatly increased plating efficiency for lysisdefective S mutants of bacteriophage λ. Complementation analysis showed that the four phenotypic groups of tol mutants that map near gal fall into three complementation groups: tolP, tolA, and tolB. Recombination analysis by three-factor crosses established the order of the three groups as tolP-tolA-tolB—gal. Because of the wide variety of phenotypic changes that accompanies mutation to colicin tolerance, revertants were isolated to test whether single or multiple mutations were involved. The reversion analysis, as well as other genetic criteria, confirmed that only single mutations were involved, suggesting that these pleiotropic changes are a consequence of a single change in the E. coli cell surface.Images	Pleiotropic Properties and Genetic Organization of the tolA, B Locus of Escherichia coli K-12	Alan Bernstein, Barry Rolfe, Kazukiyo Onodera	4627928	1972-10-01	9	
Mutants that adsorb certain colicins without being killed, i.e., tolerant mutants (tol), were isolated from Escherichia coli K-12 strains. Selection was done either with colicin K or E2. Several groups of mutants showing different phenotypes were found, and some of them showed tolerance to both K and E colicins, which have different receptors. Many of these mutants mapped near gal. Typical mutants from group II, III, and IV were studied in more detail. The mutant loci were contransducible with gal by phage P1. The linkage order was deduced to be tol-gal-λ. In partially diploid strains, these mutant loci are recessive to wild-type alleles. Temperature-dependent conditionally tolerant mutants were also isolated. Two groups were found: the first was tolerant to E2 and E3 at 40 C, but sensitive at 30 C; the second was tolerant to E2 at 30 C, but sensitive at 40 C. Experiments done with these mutants suggest that these mutations affect the heat lability of some protein that is necessary for the response of cells to colicins. Conditionally lethal tolerant mutants were isolated which at 40 C were tolerant to E2 and E3 and could not grow, but which at 30 C were fully sensitive and grew normally. The mutation mapped near malA. The tolerance at 40 C is not due to a consequence of an inactivation of general cellular metabolism, but presumably is a cause of the subsequent inhibition of cellular growth. The results suggest that some protein components involved in the response to colicin are also vital to normal cellular growth.	Interaction of Colicins with Bacterial Cells III.

The loci on the Escherichia coli genome of mutations affecting the constitutive enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) and gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (gnd), and the inducible enzyme gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrase (edd), were determined by conjugation and transduction experiments, chiefly by three-factor crosses. They are in the same region of the chromosome, and their order is gnd—his—(edd, zwf)—aroD; gnd and his are cotransduceable, as are zwf and edd. The position of gnd in Salmonella typhimurium was shown to be similar to that in E. coli.

Fourteen mutant strains of Escherichia coli were examined, each of which requires tryptophan for growth but is unaltered in any of the genes of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. The genetic lesions responsible for tryptophan auxotrophy in these strains map between str and malA. Extracts of these strains have little or no ability to charge transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) with tryptophan. We found that several of the mutants produce tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases which are more heat-labile than the enzyme of the parental wild-type strain. Of these heat-labile synthetases, at least one is protected against thermal inactivation by tryptophan, magnesium, and adenosine triphosphate. Two other labile synthetases which are not noticeably protected against heat inactivation by substrate have decreased affinity for tryptophan. On low levels of supplied tryptophan, these mutants exhibit markedly decreased growth rates but do not contain derepressed levels of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. This suggests that the charging of tryptophan-specific tRNA is not involved in repression, a conclusion which is further substantiated by our finding that 5-methyltryptophan, a compound which represses the tryptophan operon, is not attached to tRNA by the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli.

Mutants (phenotypic symbol Ref-II) refractory to colicin E2 have been isolated in several strains of Escherichia coli K-12, and a refII locus has been mapped 1 to 2 min counter clockwise to thr. A small number of Ref-II mutants are also ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive and the uvs locus in one such strain has been mapped close to the refII locus near thr. The Ref-II mutation alone does not affect recombinant formation in F− strains, but the Ref-II, UVs strains behave in many respects like Rec− mutants, giving reduced recombination frequencies in crosses with male strains. It is suggested that the refII and uvs loci correspond to closely linked if not identical genes, concerned in some way in the activity of one or more deoxyribonucleases, and that the Ref-II, UVs mutants arise as the pleiotropic expression of a single gene or of a deletion or polar mutation affecting linked genes.

Three strains of Escherichia coli with altered polynucleotide phosphorylase, Q7, Q13, and Q27, were isolated by screening clones from heavily mutagenized cultures for low levels of the enzyme. The three mutations were found to cotransduce with argG and asp, and the pnp locus which they define was mapped with respect to these loci. An explanation for the nonreciprocal cotransduction frequencies observed with asp is provided by the demonstration of an unlinked asp-suppressing locus.

Two new nonsense suppressors in Escherichia coli were found in partial diploids carrying F′14 and were shown to be on the episome. These suppressors can exist only in cells which also contain the su- allele, i.e., su+/su- heterozygotes. Presumably the mutations cause an alteration of an essential cellular component, the complete loss of which is lethal. Su7, an amber suppressor, has an efficiency of 76 per cent and su8, an ochre suppressor, an efficiency of 4 per cent.

Unlike the parental strain, these mutants grew in the absence of tryptophan at high but not at low temperature. When grown at 43.5 C with excess tryptophan (repression conditions), they produced 10 times more anthranilate synthetase than when grown at 36 C or lower temperatures. Similar, though less striking, temperature-sensitivity was observed with respect to the formation of tryptophan synthetase. Transduction mapping by phage P1 revealed that these mutants carry a mutation cotransducible with thr at 60 to 80%, in addition to trpS5, and that the former mutation is primarily responsible for the temperature-sensitive repression. These results suggest that the present mutants represent a novel type of mutation of the classical regulatory gene trpR, which probably determines the structure of a protein involved in repression of the tryptophan operon. In agreement with this conclusion, tRNA of several trpR mutants was found to be normal with respect to its tryptophan acceptability. It was also shown that the trpS5 allele, whether present in trpR or trpR+ strains, produced appreciably higher amounts of anthranilate synthetase than the corresponding trpS+ strains under repression conditions. This was particularly true at higher temperatures. These results provide further evidence for our previous conclusion that tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is somehow involved in repression of this operon.

Two genes (ubiB and ubiD) concerned with two successive reactions in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Escherichia coli were mapped and found to be closely linked. Mutant strains of E. coli carrying the ubiB− and ubiD− alleles were shown to accumulate 2-octaprenylphenol and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, respectively. These compounds were isolated and identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass and infrared spectroscopy. Cell extracts from the mutant strain carrying the ubiD− allele lack 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase activity.Images	Biosynthesis of Ubiquinone in Escherichia coli K-12: Location of Genes Affecting the Metabolism of 3-Octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic Acid and 2-Octaprenylphenol	G.

We have isolated several mutants defective in the gene for tyrosyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (tyrS). One of these mutants is described in detail. It was isolated as a tyrosine auxotroph with defects both in the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and in the tyrosine biosynthetic enzyme, prephenate dehydrogenase. It also had derepressed levels of the tyrosine-specific 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase. The latter finding suggested that a wild-type tyrS gene was required for repression of the tyrosine biosynthetic enzymes. The following results demonstrated that this hypothesis was not correct. (i) When the defective tyrS gene was transferred to another strain, the tyrosine-specific DAHP synthetase in that strain was not derepressed, and (ii) two other mutants with defective tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases had repressed levels of the tyrosine biosynthetic enzymes. The tyrS gene was located near minute 32 on the Escherichia coli chromosome by interrupted mating experiments.

A mutant requiring isoleucine and valine for growth, because of the absence of acetolactate synthase activity, has been isolated. At least one of three different genes (ilvG, ilvB, ilvI) is required for the expression of acetolactate synthase activity, thus suggesting the presence of three different acetolactate synthase isoenzymes.

plsB mutants of Escherichia coli are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate auxotrophs which owe their requirement to a Km defect in sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase, the first enzyme in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. We have located the plsB gene at minute 69 of the E. coli genetic map, far removed from the gene defined by mutants with a temperature-sensitive sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase. The plsB gene was cotransduced with the dctA locus, and the transduction data indicated that the clockwise gene order is asd, plsB, dctA, xyl. plsB− is recessive to plsB+ and all acyltransferase Km mutants tested lie very close to the plsB locus. Effective supplementation of plsB mutants was shown not to require a defective glpD gene.

Isolates with mutations in glyS, the structural gene for glycyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (GRS) in Escherichia coli, are frequently found among glycine auxotrophs. Extracts of glyS mutants have altered GRS activities. The mutants grow with normal growth rates in minimal media when high levels of glycine are provided. No other metabolite of a variety tested is capable of restoring normal growth. The glyS mutants fail to make ribonucleic acid (RNA) when depleted of exogenous glycine in strains which are RCstr but do so when the cells are RCrel. In contrast, biosynthetic mutants which are unable to synthesize glycine (glyA mutants) do not make RNA when deprived of glycine even if they are RCrel; in this case, RNA is synthesized upon glycine deprivation only when the nucleic acid precursors made from glycine are provided in the medium. The level of serine transhydroxymethylase is unaltered in extracts of any of the glyS mutants, even though the level of charged tRNAGly is at least 20-fold lower than that found in a prototrophic parent; this indicates that, if there is control over the synthesis of serine transhydroxymethylase, it is not modified by reduced levels of charging of the major species of tRNAGly.

Three streptomycin-suppressible lethal mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 have been shown to possess structurally altered glutamyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetases. Each mutant synthetase displays a Km value for glutamate which is 10-fold higher than the parental value, and the mutations reside in two widely separate loci on the genetic map. Mixing of the mutant extracts in pairs gave no indication of in vitro complementation. All three enzymes charge the minor tRNAglu fraction identically, but one (EM 120) charges the major fraction at a twofold lower rate than do the other two (EM 102 and EM 111). Possible explanations for the existence of the two synthetase loci are presented.	Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 with an Altered Glutamyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Synthetase	E. J. Murgola, E. A.

By means of RNA-DNA hybridization with DNA from different merodiploids of Escherichia coli, the genes for 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA were found near minute 74 of the genetic map.

Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were taken up into cells of Escherichia coli K-12 by a general aromatic transport system. Apparent Michaelis constants for the three amino acids were 4.7 × 10−7, 5.7 × 10−7, and 4.0 × 10−7m, respectively. High concentrations (> 0.1 mm) of histidine, leucine, methionine, alanine, cysteine, and aspartic acid also had an affinity for this system. Mutants lacking the general aromatic transport system were resistant to p-fluorophenylalanine, β-2-thienylalanine, and 5-methyltryptophan. They mapped at a locus, aroP, between leu and pan on the chromosome, being 30% cotransducible with leu and 43% cotransducible with pan. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were also transported by three specific transport systems. The apparent Michaelis constants of these systems were 2.0 × 10−6, 2.2 × 10−6, and 3.0 × 10−6m, respectively. An external energy source, such as glucose, was not required for activity of either general or specific aromatic transport systems. Azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol, however, inhibited all aromatic transport, indicating that energy production is necessary. Between 80 and 90% of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble pool formed from a particular exogenous aromatic amino acid was generated by the general aromatic transport system. This contribution was abolished when uptake was inhibited by competition by the other aromatic amino acids or by mutation in aroP. Incorporation of the former amino acid into protein was not affected by the reduction in its pool size, indicating that the general aromatic transport system is not essential for the supply of external aromatic amino acids to protein synthesis.

A mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 unable to form an essential component of the enterochelin-dependent iron transport system has been isolated. This strain carries a mutation in a gene designated fep, mapping close to two genes, entA and entD, concerned with enterochelin synthesis. Strain AN102, which carries the fep− allele, accumulates large quantities of enterochelin and gives a growth response to sodium citrate. The cytochrome b1 and total iron content, and the measurement of the uptake of 55Fe3+, indicate an impairment of the enterochelin-dependent iron transport system. The growth response to sodium citrate is related to the presence, in strain AN102, of an inducible citrate-dependent iron transport system.Images	Mutations Affecting Iron Transport in Escherichia coli	G.

Alleles responsible for X-ray-sensitive characteristics of three mutants of Escherichia coli B, which were also sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, were mapped near metE locus, and named res-1, res-2, and res-3. All the res− mutants showed no host cell reactivability (Hcr−) for transducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of P1 phage irradiated by UV but they were Hcr+ for infective DNA of P1 phage. Furthermore, they showed no detectable activity of DNA polymerase. Characteristics of allele res-1 were studied in detail. The mutant res-1 uvr+ showed an extensive degradation of DNA after UV irradiation. Double mutants carrying res-1 uvrA−, res-1 uvrB−, and res-1 uvrC− showed no marked increase in UV sensitivity beyond that of the uvr− single mutants and only negligible UV-induced DNA degradation. The uvr− mutations showed no such suppressive effect on DNA degradation induced by X rays in these double mutants. It is concluded that res− mutants are defective in the second step (repair synthesis) of the excision repair process and that DNA polymerase is partly responsible for the assumed resynthesis step.

Two distinct phenotypic classes of lysine requiring auxotrophs of Escherichia coli are described. Mutants of the LysA class produce little or no active diaminopimelic acid (DAP) decarboxylase and specifically require lysine for growth. Mutants of the LysB class produce a cryptic DAP decarboxylase which can be activated both in vivo and in vitro by higher than normal levels of its cofactor, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The LysB mutants have an alternate requirement for lysine or pyridoxine. Both LysA and LysB mutations map at 55 min, close to the thyA locus of E. coli. The association between pyridoxal phosphate and DAP decarboxylase appears to be much weaker in LysB mutants than in wild-type bacteria, and the mutant enzyme also sediments more slowly than wild-type enzyme in sucrose density gradients. The results suggest that the LysB mutations alter a specific region (or subunit) of the enzyme molecule which is needed to stabilize the binding of pyridoxal phosphate. These studies help to resolve certain contradictory observations on DAP decarboxylase reported earlier and may have relevance to pyridoxal phosphate enzymes in general. Prototrophic revertants of LysB mutants arise by second site mutations that result in increased availability of intracellular pyridoxal phosphate. These revertants appear to be derepressed for pyridoxine biosynthesis.	Mutants of Escherichia coli with a Growth Requirement for Either Lysine or Pyridoxine1	Ahmad I. Bukhari, Austin L.

About one-half of the genes coding for ribosomal RNA in Escherichia coli have been localized by the use of F-merogenotes. These cistrons have been positioned between 74 and 77 min on the E. coli map described by Taylor and Trotter. The episomal DNA carrying these genes was enriched by chromatography. The map position is discussed with reference to previous localization attempts.	Localization of a Portion of the Ribosomal RNA Genes in Escherichia coli	Linda S.

A glycerol-specific phenotypic revertant isolated from a mutant of Escherichia coli missing enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was studied. This revertant is capable of producing higher levels of glycerol kinase and the protein mediating the facilitated diffusion of glycerol (facilitator) than wild-type cells. The kinase of the revertant is indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme with respect to its sensitivity to feedback inhibition by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, its pH optimum, and its turnover number. The synthesis of glycerol kinase in strains bearing the suppressor locus is resistant to catabolite repression. The suppressor mutation mapped at the known glpK locus. Thus, it is suggested that the mutation occurred in the promoter of the operon specifying the kinase and the facilitator.

Spontaneous auxotrophs are found with high frequency in several strains of Escherichia coli K-12 deficient in Kornberg deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase. These include amino acid-, vitamin-, purine-, and pyrimidine-requiring strains. Although this was suggestive evidence that these strains might be mutators, reconstruction experiments demonstrate that auxotrophs possess a selective advantage over prototrophs in the same culture. Thus, despite the high frequency of auxotrophs in polymerase-deficient strains, it is not yet clear whether they have elevated mutation rates.

During the genetic mapping of a mutation in the pheS gene which confers temperature sensitivity on a strain of Escherichia coli K-12, an extragenic suppressor was discovered which restores ability to grow at the restrictive temperature. The suppressor, which has been named supQ, is cotransduced by bacteriophage P1 with the purE marker. SupQ does not suppress a number of amber or ochre mutations. SupQ− is carried by the prototrophic Hfr Hayes strain AB259, and the presence of the supQ− allele impairs the growth of this strain at 42 C.	New Suppressor in Escherichia coli1	R. R. B. Russell, A.

Mutant strains of Escherichia coli K-12 have been isolated in which the synthesis of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase (trp) is partially constitutive. The mutation causing derepression is closely linked to aroH [the structural gene for DAHP synthetase (trp)] and occurs in a locus designated aroJ. The aroJ mutation is not recessive in an aroJ+/aroJ− diploid strain, as the synthesis of DAHP synthetase (trp) is still derepressed in this strain. On the basis of its close linkage to aroH and its continued expression in an aroJ+/aroJ− diploid, it is postulated that aroJ is an operator locus controlling the expression of the structural gene aroH. In support of this conclusion, the synthesis of anthranilate synthetase is still normally repressible in aroJ− strains, whereas, in trpR− strains, both DAHP synthetase (trp) and anthranilate synthetase are synthesized constitutively. The synthesis of DAHP synthetase (trp) remains repressible in an operator-constitutive mutant of the tryptophan operon. In two trpS mutants which possess defective tryptophanyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase enzymes, neither DAHP synthetase (trp) nor anthranilate synthetase derepress under conditions in which the defective synthetase causes a decrease in growth rate. On the other hand, an effect of the trpS mutant alleles on the level of anthranilate synthetase has been observed in strains which are derepressed for the synthesis of this enzyme, because of a mutation in the gene trpR. Possible explanations for this effect are presented.	Repression of 3-Deoxy-d-Arabinoheptulosonic Acid-7-Phosphate Synthetase (trp) and Enzymes of the Tryptophan Pathway in Escherichia coli K-12	J.

Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 unable to synthesize the iron-sequestering compound, enterochelin, from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate have been isolated and divided into three classes on the basis of tests for enzymatic complementation. The genes affected (designated entD, entE, and entF) have been mapped by cotransduction and are located at about minute 14 on the E. coli genome. They were found to be closely linked to other genes (entA, entB, and entC) concerned with enterochelin biosynthesis and a gene (fep) concerned with the uptake of the iron-enterochelin complex. No detectable diffusible intermediate in the formation of enterochelin from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate was formed by cell extracts of mutants carrying mutations in the entD, entE, or entF genes.Images	Location of Three Genes Concerned with the Conversion of 2, 3-Dihydroxybenzoate into Enterochelin in Escherichia coli K-12	R.

Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 requiring considerably elevated concentrations of potassium for growth are readily obtained as double mutants combining a kdp mutation with a mutation in one or more of five other loci. These loci are referred to as trk, for transport of K, because these mutations result in alterations in K transport. The kdp mutation is essential in the isolation and identification of this type of mutant; in a Kdp+ strain, the presence of a trk mutation does not prevent growth of the strain in media containing very low concentrations of K. The trk loci are widely scattered over the E. coli chromosome; none of them is very near any other trk locus or near the kdp genes.

A series of independent Escherichia coli K eductants has been isolated and tested to determine the extent of their deletions. The deletions cover the P2 prophage in location H, the his operon, a suppressor of the recBC phenotype (sbcB), the gene for gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (gnd), a locus involved in cell wall synthesis (rfb), and in some cases all or part of genes involved in methylgalactoside uptake (mglP). One end of the deletion, the P2 prophage end, appears to be the same for all eductants. The other end, however, can be located before, within, and after the mglP locus.

Two temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli have been found in which the conditional growth is a result of a thermosensitive leucyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase and seryl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. The corresponding genetic loci, leuS and serS, cotransduce with lip and serC, respectively. As a result of the mutationally altered leucyl-tRNA synthetase, some leucine-, valine-, and isoleucine-forming enzymes were derepressed. Thus, leucyl-tRNA synthetase is involved in the repression of the enzymes needed for the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids.

Members of a collection of mutants of Escherichia coli unable to form colonies on nutrient agar at 42 C have been characterized on the basis of their growth response to a shift from 32 to 42 C in liquid medium. Forty-four mutants, which show an abrupt, nonlethal cessation of growth when moved to the restrictive temperature, have been characterized with respect to the effect of the mutation responsible for temperature sensitivity on deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis. In 12 mutants, the mutation causing temperature sensitivity of growth primarily affects protein synthesis, in each case through an altered aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase. Mutants with temperature-sensitive glutamyl-, phenylalanyl-, and valyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases have been obtained, and the genes specifying these enzymes have been mapped by conjugation and transduction. Another mutant has been shown to possess a temperature-sensitive tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, but this is not responsible for inability to grow at 42 C on media containing tryptophan.

Two mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 are described which are resistant to the inhibition that valine exerts on the growth of E. coli. These mutants have lesions at two different loci on the chromosome. One of them, brnP, is linked to leu (87% cotransduction) and is located between leu and azi represented on the map at 1 min; the other, brnQ, is linked to phoA (96% cotransduction), probably between proC and phoA and represented at 10 min. These mutants are resistant to valine inhibition but are sensitive to dipeptides containing valine. Since it is known that dipeptides are taken up by E. coli through a transport system(s) different from those used by amino acids, this sensitivity to the peptides suggests an alteration in the active transport of valine. The mutants are resistant to valine only if leucine is present in the growth medium; the uptake of valine is less in both mutants than it is in wild-type E. coli, and it is reduced even further if leucine is present. Under these conditions the total uptake of valine is almost completely abolished in the brnQ mutant. The brnP mutant takes up about 60% as much valine as does the wild type, but no exogenous valine is incorporated into proteins. The apparent Km and Vmax of isoleucine, leucine, and valine for the transport system are reported; the brnP mutant, when compared to the wild type, has a sevenfold higher Km for isoleucine and a 17-fold lower Km for leucine; the Vmax for the three amino acids is reduced in the brnQ mutant, up to 20-fold for valine. The transport of arginine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, and threonine is not altered in the brnQ mutant under conditions in which that of the branched amino acids is. Evidence is reported that O-methyl-threonine enters E. coli through the transport system for branched amino acids, and that thiaisoleucine does not.

Ampicillin-resistant mutants of class II are determined by a doubling of chromosomally and episomally mediated ampicillin resistance on agar plates. Several mutants were isolated from a female as well as from an Hfr strain. The mutants differed from each other in various properties such as response to colicin E2 and sodium cholate, response to the phages T4 and C21, and fermentation of galactose. By conjugation and transduction experiments, it was shown that mutations in at least four loci gave the class II phenotype. The mutations were found to be in the galU gene, the ctr gene, and two new genes close to mtl denoted lpsA and lpsB. The carbohydrate compositions of the lipopolysaccharides of the mutants were investigated and found to be changed compared to the parent strains. GalU mutants lacked rhamnose and galactose and had 11% glucose compared to the parent strain. The lpsA mutant also lacked rhamnose and had only traces of galactose and 58% glucose, whereas the lpsB mutant contained 14% rhamnose, traces of galactose, and 81% glucose compared to the parent strain.

In mutant cells of Escherichia coli missing the particulate l-α-glycerophosphate (l-α-GP) dehydrogenase necessary for aerobic growth on glycerol or l-αGP, a soluble, flavine-dependent l-α-GP dehydrogenase supports normal anaerobic growth rates on either of the two substrates with fumarate or nitrate as exogenous hydrogen acceptor. In an experiment in which glycerol served as the carbon source and nitrate as the acceptor, the growth of such a mutant was arrested upon the admission of air, whereas the growth of wild-type cells continued smoothly. Mutant cells lacking the soluble l-α-GP dehydrogenase, but possessing the particulate enzyme, can grow at normal rates aerobically on glycerol and l-α-GP or anaerobically on these compounds with nitrate, but not fumarate, as the hydrogen acceptor. Double mutants lacking both of the dehydrogenases fail to show significant growth on either glycerol or l-α-GP under any condition. Mutations affecting the anaerobic dehydrogenase (glpA locus) are situated at about minute 43 of the Taylor map, just clockwise beyond glpT, and show cotransduction with purF (1.5%), glpT (91%), and nalA (50%). The anaerobic dehydrogenase is a member of the glp regulon as judged by its inducibility by l-α-GP and by its constitutive formation in strains of glpRc genotype. The level of the anaerobic dehydrogenase is about the same in cells grown either aerobically or anaerobically with nitrate serving as a terminal hydrogen acceptor. With fumarate as terminal acceptor, the level is elevated several fold.	Anaerobic l-α-Glycerophosphate Dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli: Its Genetic Locus and Its Physiological Role1	W. S.

A new mutation in Escherichia coli, giving inability to grow on gluconic, glucuronic, or galacturonic acids, has been identified as complete deficiency of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phosphate (KDGP) aldolase activity. The genetic map position of the locus, eda, is about 35 min. The inability to grow on the uronic acids was expected, because the aldolase is on the sole known pathway of their metabolism. However, inability to grow on gluconate was less expected, because the hexose monophosphate shunt might be used, as happens in mutants blocked in the previous step, edd, of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The likely explanation of gluconate negativity is inhibition by accumulated KDGP, because gluconate is inhibitory to growth on other substances, and one type of gluconate revertant is eda−, edd−. KDGP is probably the inducer of KDGP aldolase.	2-Keto-3-Deoxygluconate 6-Phosphate Aldolase Mutants of Escherichia coli	Judith E. Fradkin, D. G. Fraenkel	4945194	1971-12-01	9	
Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 blocked in each of the three enzymatic reactions between chorismate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, in the pathway leading to the iron-sequestering compound enterochelin, have been isolated and biochemically characterized. The three genes concerned (designated entA, entB and entC) have been shown to be clustered on the chromosome between purE and gal and to be located near minute 14 by cotransduction with the purE, lip, and fep genes. entA, entB, and entC were shown to be the structural genes for 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate synthetase, and isochorismate synthetase, respectively.

A mutant (G11el) of Escherichia coli selected as being resistant to ampicillin and showing signs of an envelope defect was also found to be tolerant to colicins E2 and E3. The colicin tolerance of G11el could be partially repressed by Mg2+ ions. Transition from tolerance to sensitivity and vice versa by shifting the concentration of Mg2+ in the growth medium required several generations. This indicated that synthesis of new envelope material was needed for transition. Previous physiological results have indicated a change in the envelope lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of G11el. However, chemical analyses revealed no differences in carbohydrate composition between LPS from G11el and its parent strain G11al. Genetic experiments showed that the mutation in G11el is located at about 20 min on the E. coli K-12 chromosome. The mutation was dominant over wild type in partial diploids with the mutation located on the episome. Because colicin tolerance was the most striking phenotypic effect as a result of mutation in the actual locus, this gene will be named tolD until the exact gene product is known. Spheroplasts formed from G11al and G11el by ethylenediaminetetraacetate-lysozyme treatment did not adsorb colicin E2; however, penicillin spheroplasts of G11al and G11el were tolerant to colicin E2. Thus, colicin tolerance can be induced biochemically. It is suggested that colicin tolerance often is a secondary consequence of a change in the cell envelope.

DNA from a transducing bacteriophage carrying a fusion of the tryptophan and lactose operons of E. coli (λdtrp-lac) has been used to direct cell-free synthesis of β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). Whereas normal lac operon (λdlac) DNA requires adenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) for β-galactosidase synthesis, trp-lac DNA is unaffected by cAMP. This difference in cAMP dependence verifies the presence of a cAMP-requiring promoter in the lac operon that has been removed from the trp-lac DNA. Synthesis with trp-lac DNA is controlled by the protein product of the tryptophan repressor gene (trpR). Synthesis in extracts of trpR- (repressor-negative) cells is progressively reduced by increased additions of extract from trpR+ cells. No trpR- product repression is seen when β-galactosidase synthesis is programmed by normal lac DNA. This highly sensitive and specific assay has facilitated quantitation and partial purification of the trp repressor.

Horiuchi, Kensuke (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.), and Edward A. Adelberg. Growth of male-specific bacteriophage in Proteus mirabilis harboring F-genotes derived from Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 89:1231–1236. 1965.—Male-specific bacteriophage MS2 was shown to infect and grow in Proteus mirabilis strains which harbor F-genotes derived from Escherichia coli K-12. The burst size was 2,000 to 3,000, which is similar to that in E. coli K-12, whereas the latent period was 45 min, definitely longer than that in E. coli. In spite of the multiplication of MS2 in male P. mirabilis in broth, P. mirabilis strains failed to show plaque formation by MS2 on agar plates; this failure may be related to the low efficiency of phage adsorption. No host-controlled modification of MS2 by P. mirabilis was detected.

Recipient (F−) cells of Escherichia coli are sensitive to an excess of Hfr donor cells. This phenomenon of lethal zygosis is associated with conjugation and is observed as a continuous fall in F− viable cells during liquid mating, or as inhibition of F− growth on solid media. One class of survivors, which arose in the zones of inhibition on solid media, was no longer sensitive to lethal zygosis and exhibited the following properties: sensitivity to male-specific phage, donor ability, and surface exclusion. Since these characteristics were sensitive to acridine orange treatment, the strains carry an F factor extrachromosomally. They are, however, defective in some way since they retain sensitivity to female-specific phage. Temporary sensitivity to lethal zygosis in these and in standard F+ strains can be induced by the formation of F− phenocopies. We have suggested that there is an immunity to lethal zygosis (Ilz+) associated with the F factor and discuss the results in terms of this hypothesis.

The location of the origin of transfer on the map of Flac has been determined by two different techniques. The first showed that no transfer cistrons were transferred early by a transposition Hfr strain with a known point of chromosomal integration into Flac, and the second used a series of transfer-deficient Hfr deletion strains to map a locus required in cis for chromosome transfer by an incoming Flac factor. Both techniques gave results consistent with a location for the origin of transfer between traJ and the φR11 locus.	Location of the Origin of Transfer of the Sex Factor F	N. S.

The gene A product of Escherichia coli bacteriophage ϕX 174, necessary for initiation of ϕX DNA synthesis, has been identified and purified to near homogeneity. The gene A protein is shown to be a highly specific DNA endonuclease which breaks one phosphodiester bond in the viral strand of either double-stranded, circular ϕX replicative form I (RFI), or in single-stranded, circular ϕX viral DNA; it is inactive against all other species of DNA tested.

A series of Hfr deletion strains carrying deletions extending different distances into the integrated F factor have been used to map loci for surface exclusion (traS) and for incompatibility (inc) on the Escherichia coli K-12 sex factor F. traS mapped between traG and traD. It forms a part of the large operon, including all the known transfer genes except traJ, and is co-controlled with these. The product of traS is not required for formation of the F pilus. inc mapped between the φR11 locus and the origin of transfer; it is therefore one of the earliest loci transferred during conjugation.

Parental replicative-form (RF*) DNA of bacteriophage ϕX174 in a replication-deficient host cell (rep3-) exhibits two characteristic features that correlate the function of viral gene A with the initiation of viral DNA replication: a specific discontinuity in the viral strand of a constant number of RF molecules and elongation of the viral strand to yield replicative-intermediate DNA forms with single-stranded tails. At high multiplicities of infection, these initiation events are limited to an average of four specifically nicked RFII molecules per cell. The limiting factor from the host cell may be related (or identical) to the essential bacterial sites known to limit the participation of parental genomes in RF replication. Double-infection experiments with wild-type phage and phage carrying an amber mutation in gene A show that the formation of gene A-specific RFII and RI is cis-limited to only the wild-type DNA. These results provide a basis at the DNA level for the known asymmetric complementation of gene A.Images	Cis-Limited Action of the Gene-A Product of Bacteriophage ϕX174 and the Essential Bacterial Site	Bertold Francke, Dan S.

Although the two F′ elements, F57 (carrying his+) and KLF1 (carrying leu+), cannot normally coexist in the same cell, crosses between RecA- strains of Escherichia coli carrying these two elements gave rise, at a low frequency, to progeny carrying both the his+ and leu+ markers in an extrachromosomal state. Genetic studies showed that the his+ and leu+ markers were now linked, and centrifugation studies of F′ DNA isolated from these strains confirmed the presence of a new species of DNA molecule of altered size. It is proposed that the his+ and leu+ genes in these strains are covalently linked on a single “fused” F′ element.

A series of Hfr deletion mutants was isolated. These mutants contain deletions which extend from a λ prophage into an Flac which is integrated into the gal operon. Transfer-deficient deletion mutants were found to fall into four different phenotypic groups when tested for male- and female-specific phage resistance. Conjugational and transductional complementation tests with Flac point mutants deficient in transfer (tra−) were performed, and the order of 11 tra cistrons was determined. The tra genes are all located between an F gene for the inhibition of female-specific phages and the transposed lac operon originally carried by the Flac. The order of genes in the Hfr studied was established to be: proC... φIIR... traJ traA traE traK traB traC traF traH traG traD traI...lac...attλ...bio.

P1 transduction has been used to perform a complementation analysis of a series of transfer-deficient mutants of Flac. The results define ten cistrons and are consistent with the results of a conjugational analysis presented in an accompanying report. Both sets of results are summarized here. Between them, they define eleven cistrons, traA through traK, necessary for conjugational deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transfer. Mutants in traI and traD and some in traG still make F-pili, although traD mutants are resistant to f2 phage; their products may be involved in conjugational DNA metabolism. Other mutants in traG and all mutants in the remaining eight cistrons do not make F-pili. One of these, traJ, may be a control cistron, and the others may specify a biosynthetic pathway responsible for synthesis and modification of the F-pilin subunit protein and its assembly into the F-pilus.

A series of 102 transfer-deficient (tra−) mutants of Flac (84 of which have been previously described) were classified as carrying frameshift, amber, ochre, UGA, and nonsuppressible mutations. Techniques were evolved for using cultures of F prime strains as efficient recipients in matings, for measuring the number of (F′/F′) heterozygote cells in transient populations, and for measuring complementation between different Flac tra− mutants. These techniques were used to define nine tra cistrons and to assign most of the tra− mutations to one or other of these.

Gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GND) is genetically determined in Salmonella typhimurium by a locus (gnd) mapping between the somatic antigen (rfb) and histidine (his) operons. The enzyme is constitutive. Strains of Salmonella carrying an F′ genetic element which contains the gnd+ gene have GND activity two to three times that of the wild type. This gene dosage effect was used to determine that the GND reaction is not rate-limiting for the metabolism of glucose by the pentose shunt in S. typhimurium.

In addition to carrying determinants conferring resistance to at least two antibiotics, chloramphenicol and streptomycin, a Klebsiella aerogenes strain contains a plasmid responsible for increased β-galactosidase activity. The plasmid can be transferred to Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains. K. aerogenes segregants without the plasmid grow on lactose one-half as fast as the parent strain and contain only one-tenth to one-fifth as much β-galactosidase.

An F′ factor, FS400, carrying the his operon, the gnd gene, and the rfb gene cluster of Salmonella typhimurium was isolated. FS400 was introduced into an Escherichia coli strain having a lengthy deletion of the his gene region. From this strain, Hfr derivatives were isolated which had the F′ factor integrated in the tonB locus near the attachment site of φ80. One of the Hfr strains was lysogenized with a heat-inducible, h mutant of φ80, and from this strain a high-frequency transducing phage carrying the his genes and the gnd gene of Salmonella was isolated.

Several strains of Escherichia coli K-12 harboring two F factors were isolated from Hfr x Hfr crosses. These strains were transiently capable of initiating chromosome transfer from two separate points of origin, and of transferring two different sex factors as integrated chromosomal markers. Each strain tested invariably reverted to a simple Hfr by loss of one of the inherited F factors. The F factor persisting in the revertant was, in nearly every case, that which had been inherited from the recipient Hfr parent.

The frequency of genetic exchanges between F′ factors and the bacterial chromosome was studied in recombination-deficient Escherichia coli mutants under conditions in which the recombinant F′ factors were immediately transferred to new hosts. In a series of double matings, F101-1 thr+leu− episomes were first transferred into each of four intermediate F−thr−leu+ strains carrying various rec alleles. After the original F′ donors were killed with phage T6, the F101-1 episomes were then transferred from the intermediate cells to F−thr−leu−StrRrecA− females. Recipients of nonrecombinant episomes formed Thr+ (StrR) colonies, and recipients of recombinant episomes formed Leu+(StrR) colonies. A comparison of the numbers of Leu+(StrR) and Thr+(StrR) colonies shows that recB− males formed 18 to 21% and recC− formed 47 to 60% of the wild-type level of recombinant episomes that could be detected after transfer. No recombinant episomes were detected using a recA− intermediate strain. If the intermediate strains harboring the F101 episomes were purified, allowed to grow for 50 generations, and then mated with the recA− recipient, recombinant episomes were transferred at 8% of the wild-type level for recB− and 13% for recC−. In contrast, only 0.4 and 0.6% of the normal number of recombinants were obtained from crosses between Hfr Cavalli donors and the same recB− and recC− strains. Recombinant episomes were detected with greater frequency among newly formed rec+, recB−, and recC− partial diploids than in those which were 50 generations old.

During previous attempts to find mutants in which incompatibility between two F-prime (F′) factors of E. coli is abolished, we found that two F′ factors harbored in the same cell occasionally recombined to form a single genetic unit. Thus, a fused F′trp+arg+ factor was obtained from a mating of a strain carrying recA F′trp+ with a strain carrying recA F′arg+. In the present paper physical fusion of the two F′ factors, inferred from genetic studies, is confirmed by electron microscopy. F DNA was extracted, after detergent lysis, from four fused F′ strains: the parental F′trp+ and F′arg+ strains and three F+ strains. This supercoiled DNA was separated on ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradients and converted to the open circular from before electron microscopy. The contour lengths in μm of the various DNA preparations were: F′trp+, 59.4; F′arg+, 33.2; the four F′trp+arg+ factors, 38.5, 39.6, 63.2, and 73.5: the three F factors, 31.1, 31.1, and 31.0. Thus, different fused F′ factors formed from the same parental F′ factors vary in length, but are shorter than the sum of the parental F′ factors.Images	Characterization by Electron Microscopy of Fused F-Prime Factors in Escherichia coli	S.

The time of replication of a bacterial plasmid, Flac, during the division cycle of Escherichia coli has been estimated in exponentially growing cultures and at various times after a shift from minimal medium to a richer medium (a shift-up). There is a variation in the cell age at which the capacity to synthesize β-galactosidase (β-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.23) doubles (assumed to be a measure of the time at which the Flac plasmid replicates) when this capacity is measured at various times during the shift-up, and with increasing steady-state exponential growth rate. Cells growing at slow and moderate growth rates exhibit Flac replication in the middle of the division cycle. With increasing time after a shift-up or with increasing growth rate the plasmid replicates at earlier times, eventually at cell division, and finally in the older cells. This variation in the cell age at which the plasmid replicates is similar to the variation in cell age at which chromosome initiation occurs during a shift-up, although plasmid replication occurs slightly before initiation of chromosome replication.

In vitro studies have been of great value in elucidating the mechanism of the regulation of several bacterial operons. To obtain a deoxyribonucleic acid preparation enriched for the histidine (his) and for the isoleucine-valine (ilv) operons, we have isolated bacteriophages carrying the his and the ilv regions of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Transposition of the his operon to a site close to the att80 region of the E. coli chromosome has been carried out selecting for integration of a temperature-sensitive F′his+ in the tonB locus. This transposed strain has been lysogenized with φ80iλ. Upon induction of the lysogen, His+ transductants have been isolated, which, on further induction give rise to HFT (high frequency of transduction) lysates. Preliminary characterization of the transducing phage is reported. The ilv operon, carried on an F′ particle, has been fused to an episome carrying the att80 region. The fused episome has been lysogenized with φ80i λt68. Upon induction of the lysogen, Ilv+ transductants have been isolated which on further induction give rise to HFT lysates.

PB15 is an Hfr strain of Escherichia coli K-12. It arose from an F′ strain carrying a temperature-sensitive F-gal by an event which blocked the detachment of F-gal in the normally reversible integration process. In PB15, the detachment of F-gal by a second mechanism can now be detected: this mechanism results in the excision and transfer of extended chromosomal segments which include the integrated F-gal; the excised segments are inferred to have circularized. Their excision, which is independent of the recA+ allele, occurs at an unusually high rate during conjugation; a mutant F-initiator protein is suggested as the cause of this phenomenon. After their establishment in recipients, the enlarged F-genotes undergo further deletions of included donor genes by a process which is again recA+-independent. In Rec+, but not in Rec−, cells, a high proportion of the deleted fragments are rescued by integration into the recipient's chromosome.

The ability of autonomous transmissible plasmids or sex factors to transfer chromosomal genes to F− recipient bacteria has been investigated by using a series of rec+ and recA− donor strains. It is concluded that chromosome transfer by most sex factors is virtually dependent upon the functional integrity of the bacterial recombination system. However, evidence is presented that suggests the existence of plasmid-specified mechanisms of interaction with the chromosome which are independent of the bacterial recombination system.

Bacteriol. 88:367–373. 1964.—Evidence is presented that in an F′ strain of Escherichia coli. AB1206, the chromosomal region corresponding to the merogenote of F14 is deleted. AB1206 differs from all other F′ strains in its stability and in its relative inability to transfer chromosomal markers under conditions in which transfer of the merogenote occurs at a frequency of 100%. Its stability can be accounted for by the fact that the loss of the F merogenote, which contains approximately 10% of the genetic information of the cell, would be a lethal event. The failure of AB1206 to transfer chromosomal markers, except at very low frequencies, can be explained in terms of the crossover model proposed to explain chromosome transfer by F′ strains, since the homologous chromosomal region is missing in this strain. The conclusion that the chromosomal region is deleted is strengthened by the finding that the different enzymes coded for by the genes on F14 are present in AB1206 at the level found in haploid strains, but have double this activity in homozygous diploids carrying F14.

J. Bacteriol. 85:1402–1408. 1963.—When F′ strains harboring the F-merogenate F14 are mated with female recipients, the transfer of the F-merogenote begins, in the majority of cases, before chromosome transfer. The markers on F14 are transferred in the sequence met-1, arg-1, ilva-16, and sex-factor, met-1 being transferred first and sex-factor being transferred last, 9 min after met-1. In the class of zygotes that have received both the F-merogenote marker met-1 and the chromosomal marker xyl or mal, the gradient of recombination frequencies for the F-merogenote markers arg-1 and ilva-16 is much steeper than in the corresponding zygotes that have not received chromosomal markers. In F′ strains which exhibit an increased frequency of transfer of chromosome markers, this gradient of recombination frequencies for merogenote markers is much steeper. An analysis of experiments involving an F′ strain with a much shorter F-merogenote, F16, and of a triparental mating in which F-merogenote and chromosome were transferred from different donor cells reveals that the effect of chromosome transfer on the recovery of distal F-merogenote markers in the zygotes is not due to any form of postzygotic elimination. It is suggested that, when F′ strains which are transferring F-merogenote begin to transfer chromosome, the latter event causes breakage of the F-merogenote. A second consequence of this interaction is a delay of 8 to 10 min in the first appearance of chromosomal markers in the zygotes.	GENE TRANSFER BY F′ STRAINS OF ESCHERICHIA COLI K-12 II.

Bacteriol. 87:566–573. 1964.—A total of 60 mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 resistant to 10−2m valine were isolated from the valine-sensitive F′ strain AB1206. Conjugation experiments showed that in five of these mutants the valine-resistance locus is closely linked to the structural genes governing isoleucine-valine biosynthesis. In these five valine-resistant mutants, three enzymes of the isoleucine-valine pathway were found to be coordinately derepressed: l-threonine deaminase, dihydroxy acid dehydrase, and transaminase B. Two other enzymes of this pathway, the condensing enzyme and the reductoisomerase, were unaffected. The mutation from valine-sensitivity to valine-resistance appears to have altered an operator locus, because the derepressed state is dominant over the repressed state in diploids heterozygous for the valine-resistance locus. The valine-resistant mutants excrete isoleucine into the medium. The significance of these findings with respect to the valine-sensitivity of E. coli K-12 and the regulation of the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine by this organism are discussed.

Recombinant strains selected on the basis of having a recombinant F-merogenote were found frequently to contain a recombinant chromosome of the reciprocal type.

Segregants from merodiploids heterozygous at two or more sites in the lac region were selected on the basis of containing a recombinant F-merogenote. Such recombinants frequently contained a recombinant chromosome as well. When the merodiploid was heterozygous at two sites, the frequency at which reciprocally recombinant chromosomes were present in the selected population was lower when the two marked sites were in the same gene and close together than when the sites were more widely separated. When the merodiploid was heterozygous at four sites and selection was made for an intragenic recombinational event, the recombinant chromosome was the reciprocal type about half the time and about half the time was not. Among the latter genotypes, most were nonrecombinant for the intragenic pair of markers. The data are consistent with a model in which recombination leads to the formation of two recombinant products, each containing a region of hybrid deoxyribonucleic acid.

The isolation and characterization of high-frequency recombining strains from different Escherichia coli host cells containing either the F factor or the Col V factor are described. The strains (with one exception) formed from three of the V+ parents showed the same origin and polarity of transfer (xyl-arg-pro-trp-his-mal). The Hfr strains formed from the one remaining V+ and the F+ host cells showed a greater variety in their points of origin. In addition, several Hfr strains isolated from V+ parents lost the ability to produce colicin V. Fv+ segregants of these were isolated, and the Fv factors appeared to retain their preferential site for Hfr formation, but they lacked other propertes controlled by the Col V factor. Chromosomal integration of episomes and its relation to the fertility of F+ and V+ strains are discussed. Production of colicin V appeared to be uninfluenced by the state of the Col V factor within the cell.

The frequency of chromosome transfer from various recombination-deficient F-lac+ donor strains was estimated by standardizing the yield of conjugants receiving a male chromosomal marker against the level of episome transfer in the mating mixture. The efficiency of chromosome transfer from newly formed F-lac+ cells carrying recB21 or recC22 was more than 50% of the wild-type value, although it was about 10 and 20%, respectively, if the male cell lines had become established. In contrast, recA13 donors transmitted the chromosome with less than 10−4 of the normal frequency. If chromosome transfer from F-lac+ strains reflects the cutting and subsequent joining of homologous single strands of episomal and chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid by recombination, these results imply that the completed unions are not made in recA cells, but can be effected with more than 50% of normal efficiency in newly formed partial diploids mutant at either recB or recC. Thus, the defective stage in recA mutants may precede strand joining, whereas the deficiency in recB or recC cells may involve a later step in recombinant formation.

Control mechanisms of replication of bacterial genetic elements are poorly understood at present. We have studied one such mechanism involving replication of the F factor in Escherichia coli. The F factor can replicate either autonomously in F+ or F′ strains, or as an integral part of the chromosome in Hfr strains. We have shown that presence of either an integrated F factor or a free F factor prevents replication of a second free F factor. Two integrated F factors can replicate in the same cell.The present experiments show that when a F′lac element was transferred by mating into an Hfr strain, it had to become integrated into the chromosome in order to persist. With a recombination-deficient (recA) Hfr strain as recipient, the frequency of F′lac integration was greatly reduced. This permitted us to isolate a mutant Hfr strain in which the F′lac element was able to replicate autonomously. The mutation has most likely occurred in the integrated F factor itself. Availability of this new recA mutant Hfr strain facilitates genetic analysis of the F factor, since in recA+ Hfr strains frequent integration of a free F factor into the chromosome obscures recognition of complementation and recombination between two free F factors.

Integration of the factors Fv and F into the chromosome of a substrain of Escherichia coli K-12 has been studied. The Fv factor is a fertility factor derived from Col V, lacking the ability to govern the production of colicin V. The derivatives of an Hfrv (Hfr isolated from a V colicinogenic parent) strain, PK2 (initially isolated from C600 V+), were shown to retain a unique bidirectional sex factor affinity locus between recA and pheA. This site shows no affinity for the E. coli K-12 F factor as shown by inability to isolate Hfr strains with origins in this region from a parental strain containing a cytoplasmic F factor. However this area exhibits two regions of homology to the V colicinogenic factor. One gives rise to Hfrv strains identical to the original Hfrv strain, PK2, with an origin and polarity of transfer designated pheA-CC injecting markers in the order pheA-his-trp-pro. The second gives rise to strains apparently originating at the same site but with reverse polarity designated recA-C, transferring markers in the order recA-thyA-str-xyl. For strains possessing the Fv factor only the second homology is apparent. A model for the evolution of these strains is presented.

We examined in detail conditions necessary for making reproducible and for maximizing the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from a sex factor-containing cell as covalent circles. The results argue that under optimal conditions covalent circles are neither created nor lost during the isolation procedure. The causes of the culture-to-culture variation in recovery of covalent circular deoxyribonucleic acid were investigated but an understanding of this is not yet at hand. Some commonly used conditions which drastically reduce the recovery of covalent circles are described.

The DNA of the episome was partially purified from Proteus DNA by preparative equilibrium centrifugation in caesium chloride, and by a bulk method using hydroxyapatite. The buoyant density of the episomal DNA is 1.707, corresponding to a (G+C) content of 47%. By optical renaturation the genetic complexity of the episomal DNA was found to be 76×106 daltons. RNA was synthesized in vitro by using the episomal DNA as template. By hybridizing this RNA with DNA extracted from E. coli carrying F′8 gal, it is shown that the number of copies of the episome per replicating chromosome is close to two during exponential growth. The episome makes up about 4.4% of the total DNA of the growing cells. The activities of galactokinase and galactose 1-phosphate uridylyl-transferase in cells with and without episomal and chromosomal gal genes were found to be proportional to the number of gal genes present, when the cells were induced with d-fucose, but not when they were induced with d-galactose.

In matings between F′ donors and recombination-deficient Hfr recipients, we isolated progeny which transferred both episomal markers and Hfr markers early and with high frequency. A number of these progeny had two integrated sex factors. Investigation of these double Hfr strains showed that the F′ nearly always integrated in a homologous region of the chromosome. In any particular mating system integration was specific as to location and direction of chromosome transfer.

"The injection into one rabbit (with Freund's adjuvants) of a specific precipitate made with antibodies from the serum of another rabbit is usually followed by the appearance in the serum of the first rabbit of antibodies which precipitate the serum of certain rabbits but not of others. It was found that the antigen (or one of the antigens) concerned in the reaction of these anti rabbit serum antibodies with rabbit sera had an antibody function, and was therefore a protein. It was concluded that at least one serum protein antigen, the specificity of which so far has been considered to be uniform throughout the animal species, can instead be present in different individuals as different forms or allotypes with somewhat different antigenic specificities. A large number of rabbit sera were allowed to react with a large number of rabbit immune sera. The gel method of immunochemical analysis made it possible to enumerate the allotypes that took part in each reaction. In addition, the technique mainly used (simple diffusion in separate tubes) made it possible to recognize the presence of one given allotype by the mere aspect of the precipitation zone in the reaction of one suitable immune serum with any serum in which the concerned allotype occurred. Neighboring reactions of sera, in contact with each other and with the suitable immune serum, in suitable cells easily constructed in the laboratory, were carried out occasionally and, each time, their results agreed with the previous identification. The analysis of the reactions in tubes lead to a list of seven allotypes designated by a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, of which two or more (e not included) were contained in almost every serum. The specific conditions necessary for antibody formation against an allotype are its absence from the serum of the immunized animal and, except in the case of cross-reactivity, its presence in the immunizing material. When these necessary conditions are fulfilled for several allotypes at the same time, their competition in the immunization seems to favor the allotype present at the highest concentration. The individuality of six of the listed allotypes has been discussed independently of the part of their specificity that may be common to all the allotypes of one given protein antigen in all the individuals of the same animal species. A cross-reaction of the anti f rabbit antibodies with allotype g has been observed. When two allotypic specificities were detected in one serum, attempts were made to find whether they were carried by two allotypes, i.e. by two distinct kinds of molecules, instead of being the manifestation of two ""allotypic patterns"" present on the same molecules. The presence of several allotypes in the immune sera made it often impossible to find definitive answers in this regard. However, for a limited number of cases of two allotypic specificities present in one serum, it could be demonstrated that at least a large proportion (if not the totality) of the two allotypes were independent of each other. No sign of a systematic coexistence of two allotypic patterns on the same molecules has been observed to date."	ALLOTYPY OF RABBIT SERUM PROTEINS I.

"Rheumatoid factors in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis appear to be specifically directed against genetically determined ""antigens"" in human γ-globulin. At least eight rheumatoid factors of differing specificity exist; usually several are present in combination in the same serum. The different rheumatoid factors can be readily detected through their pattern of reactivity with anti-Rh antibodies from different individuals. Rheumatoid factors in diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis were found to have a more restricted specificity, contrasted to the broader reactivity of the factors in most rheumatoid arthritis sera. A specificity similar to that for incomplete antibodies was not demonstrated for the reaction of rheumatoid factors with aggregated γ-globulin or with γ-globulin to form the ""22S complex."" In certain instances, using the anti-Rh system, rheumatoid factors were found to react poorly with the patient's own γ-globulin, compared to that of other individuals of different genetic γ-globulin types. These results, as well as additional indirect evidence, indicate that the rheumatoid factors can possess isospecificity. However, a certain degree of autospecificity was also found which was most clearly evident through complex formation with the patients own γ-globulin and in the reaction with aggregates. The relevance of these findings to possible isoantibody as well as autoantibody concepts is discussed."	SPECIFICITY OF THE REACTION BETWEEN RHEUMATOID FACTORS AND GAMMA GLOBULIN	Hugh H.

The genetic factors Gm(a), Gm(b), Gm(x), and Inv(a), Inv(b) described for normal human γ-globulin were all found in different myeloma proteins. A single myeloma protein never contained more than one product of alternate alleles even in heterozygous individuals. However, factors determined by the two different loci were often found in the same myeloma protein. The Gm(a) character of the myeloma protein parallelled that of the normal γ-globulin of the same serum in most cases. In contrast, the Gm(b) character was usually absent in the myeloma protein when it was directly demonstrable in the normal γ-globulin. The myeloma proteins from six Negroes were Gm(a+b-), whereas the normal γ-globulin was Gm(a+b+). This indicates that the effect of gene Gmb is similar in Negroes and whites, even though its relation to gene Gma is different in the two races. Gm factors were found only in the 7S γ-globulin type myelomas and not in other products of plasma cell tumors. Inv characters were, however, present in all four types of proteins studied, namely 7S and 19S γ-globulins, β2A-globulins, and Bence Jones proteins. In two instances, genetic heterogeneity of the protein products was demonstrated suggesting the proliferation of more than one clone of plasma cells in some multiple myeloma patients. The accumulated evidence obtained in this study strongly suggested that the presence and absence of genetic characters was compatible with the concept that myeloma proteins were closely analogous to individual moieties in the spectrum of normal γ-globulins rather than truly abnormal proteins. Their study offered evidence of a heterogeneity of genetic characters among the normal γ-globulins in a given individual. It also appears probable that in normal individuals single plasma cells have a restricted capacity to express genetic information in their protein product.

Antisera to normal 7S γ-globulin and to Bence Jones proteins permit the grouping of myeloma proteins (gamma and beta 2A types), Bence Jones proteins, and the Waldenström type macroglobulins into two fundamental antigenic groups. The antigenic determinants responsible for this grouping are common to all these proteins which fall in the general category of immunoglobulins. Antisera to Bence Jones proteins were particularly useful for this classification since they failed to react with the proteins of the opposite group. These antisera also permit the grouping of normal 7S γ-globulin into two major types. The Bence Jones proteins from individual patients were found to correspond in antigenic group to that of the serum myeloma protein. Studies with antisera to 7S γ-globulin and to Bence Jones proteins indicated that the Bence Jones proteins were antigenically identical to a portion of the corresponding multiple myeloma protein molecules.

Certain bacterial plasmids can be isolated as unique complexes of supercoiled circular DNA and protein. These complexes are distinguished by the conversion of the supercoiled DNA to the relaxed or open-circular DNA form upon treatment with ionic detergents, proteases, or alkali. This report demonstrates that the open-circular DNA resulting from the pronase-induced relaxation of the complexes of colicinogenic factors E1 (ColE1) and E2 (ColE2) possesses a strand-specific break. In each case this break is found in the heavy strand of the DNA as defined by CsCl centrifugation in the presence of poly(U,G). In addition, the ColE1 and ColE2 complexes exhibit certain properties that are plasmid specific. Heat treatment, and to a lesser extent pronase treatment, inactivates the ColE2 complex, making it insensitive to agents that formerly were capable of inducing relaxation (conversion of the DNA to the open-circular form). In contrast, the ColE1 complex is not inactivated by these treatments. The potential role of these strand-specific relaxation complexes in DNA replication is discussed.

PBSH, a defective phage of Bacillus subtilis strain 168, is described. Conditions are given for optimal induction of the prophage with mitomycin C. After a latent period of 90 min, cells were lysed and phage-like particles were released with a burst size of approximately 100 to 400 phage per bacterium. Since no known host supports phage replication after infection, burst size was determined by electron microscope count. Purification procedures and criteria for purity are described. The molecular weight of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from PBSH was estimated by length measurement and sedimentation. No circular DNA molecules were found by either technique. PBSH DNA molecules are linear, double-stranded, and of homogeneous molecular weight, about 12 × 106 daltons. There is no evidence for single-strand breaks. The majority of PBSH DNA molecules show a sedimentation behavior dependent on ionic strength. It is inferred that most of the DNA molecules are less hydrodynamically rigid than native DNA having a similar average base composition and molecular weight. Possible reasons for the sedimentation behavior are discussed.Images	Defective Bacteriophage PBSH in Bacillus subtilisI.

Treatment of Bacillus subtilis strain 168 with mitomycin C caused induction of a defective prophage, PBSH. During induction, extensive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis took place. Concurrently, a change in marker frequency of the bacterial DNA was noticed. The frequency of only one marker, ade-16, the marker closest to the origin of the bacterial chromosome, was enhanced manyfold. DNA from whole phage particles transformed all bacterial markers at a frequency equal to that of DNA in the noninduced culture, except ade-16, the frequency of which was enhanced 30 to 100 times. Analysis of a double isotope experiment demonstrated that 14% of the phage DNA was derived from preinduction bacterial DNA. The other 86% of DNA in phage particles was DNA replicated after induction. Density label experiments with 5-bromodeoxyuridine showed that postinduction DNA synthesis took place preferentially at the origin region of the bacterial chromosome. Measurement of the molecular weight of DNA replicated after induction clearly showed that postinduction DNA replication is chromosomal. No evidence for prophage detachment and autonomous phage DNA replication was found. The data indicated that, after mitomycin C action, the bacterial chromosome under-went multiple reinitiation at the origin, while normal sequential DNA replication was stopped. The pool of replicated bacterial DNA was fragmented randomly. This DNA was packaged into PBSH particles which were released after cell lysis.	Defective Bacteriophage PBSH in Bacillus subtilisII.

Heterozygous, partial diploid Salmonella typhosa hybrids obtained from matings with Escherichia coli K-12 Hfr strains were observed to contain supercoiled, circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when examined by the dye-buoyant density method. Examination of one such S. typhosa hybrid after its loss, by segregation, of the inherited E. coli genetic markers revealed a concurrent loss of its supercoiled circular DNA. Subsequent remating of this segregant with various E. coli Hfr strains resulted in the reappearance of the circular DNA. Molecular weight determinations of circular DNA molecules isolated from a number of S. typhosa partial diploid hybrids were made by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. These studies revealed a range of molecular sizes among the various hybrids examined, but each hybrid exhibited only a single characteristic size for its contained circular DNA. The range of size is consistent with the presence in each hybrid of a different length of E. coli chromosome. It was concluded that the E. coli Hfr genetic segments transferred to these S. typhosa hybrids were conserved, in the diploid state, in the form of supercoiled, circular DNA molecules.Images	Isolation of Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid from Salmonella typhosa Hybrids Obtained from Matings with Escherichia coli Hfr Donors	R.

Inhibition of the growth of Escherichia coli M.R.E. 600 by six different metal salts was accompanied by a greater decrease in the synthesis of RNA than in that of protein. The action of cobalt chloride was exceptional; inhibited cells made an excess of RNA to an extent depending on the concentration of Co2+, the time of incubation and the concentration of Mg2+ in the medium. Preferential synthesis of RNA in the presence of cobalt chloride was not confined to E. coli but occurred to various extents in some, but not all, of the other micro-organisms that were tested. Possible reasons for the special effect of Co2+ are discussed.	Inhibition of bacterial growth by metal salts. A survey of effects on the synthesis of ribonucleic acid and protein	M. R. Blundell, D. G. Wild	4907879	1969-11-01	9	
During inhibition of the growth of Escherichia coli by cobalt chloride protein synthesis was decreased more than the synthesis of RNA. Three species of particle accumulated during the incubation. These had sedimentation coefficients of about 44s, 33s and 23s in tris buffer containing 10 mm-magnesium acetate and 100 mm-potassium chloride, but their sedimentation properties were susceptible to changes in buffer composition. The particles contained RNA but were more readily degraded by ribonuclease than were the ribosomes. RNA isolated from the particles differed slightly in sedimentation properties from the major species of ribosomal RNA. The particles are likely to be closely related to ribosome precursors that have been detected in other circumstances. Changes in the polyribosome fraction during inhibition by cobalt chloride, nickel chloride and chloramphenicol provided further evidence that inhibition by Co2+ involves specific effects on the protein-synthesizing machinery.

I have sequenced the first 63 bases of mRNA transcribed in vitro from the UV5 promoter mutant of the E. coli lactose operon. Sonic fragments of DNA, 1000 base pairs long and purified to contain only the lac operator-promoter region, were used as template. The UV5 promoter mutation allows transcription of the lac operon in the absence of catabolite activator protein and cAMP; lac repressor controls the synthesis of this RNA. I find that during synthesis, RNA polymerase pauses at particular sites along the DNA, naturally generating several discrete sizes of RNA that provide overlaps useful for sequencing. The UV5 lac mRNA initiates within the lac operator and copies the operator sequence. The AUG initiator codon for β-galactosidase occurs at position 39 of the message. The sequence is: pppA-A-U-U-G-U-G-A-G-C-G-G-A-U-A-A-C-A-A-U-U-U- C-A-C-A-C-A-G-G-A-A-A-C-A-G-C-U-A-U-G-A-C-C-A-U- G-A-U-U-A-C-G-G-A-U-U-C-A-C-U-G-G.Images	The Nucleotide Sequence of the Lactose Messenger Ribonucleic Acid Transcribed from the UV5 Promoter Mutant of Escherichia coli	Nancy M.

The transfer of transducing phage DNA in association with the mandelate genetic region of Pseudomonas putida strain PRS1 (termed pfdm) has been achieved by growing together mandelate-positive PpG2 cells harboring pfdm as an extrachromosomal element and mandelate-deleted PpG1 strains. This transfer is analogous to sexual conjugation in the enterobacteria. The transfer of pfdm elements is always associated with chromosome mobilization and some rare recombinants acquire genetic donor ability. We have therefore concluded that the pfdm elements are responsible for initiation of chromosome mobilization in a manner not yet fully understood.

Richmond, Mark H. (National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, England). Dominance of the inducible state in strains of Staphylococcus aureus containing two distinct penicillinase plasmids. J. Bacteriol. 90:370–374. 1965.—The phenotypic expression of penicillinase synthesis is studied in a strain of S. aureus containing two distinct plasmids, each carrying the penicillinase structural gene and its associated control (inducibility) gene. One plasmid in the heterodiploid carries the genes responsible for the normal, fully inducible synthesis of a structural mutant of type A penicillinase, and the second plasmid carries the genes required for constitutive synthesis of C-type enzyme. The heterodiploid is phenotypically fully inducible, indicating that the inducible state dominates the constitutive in penicillinase synthesis. The heterodiploid synthesizes approximately equal quantities of A- and C-type enzyme when fully induced. Parental types are obtained from the heterodiploid by spontaneous segregation at a frequency of about 1 per 1,000 divisions of each character. Recombination between the two plasmids in such a persistent heterodiploid is a rare event.

The penicillinase plasmids, a series of extrachromosomal resistance factors in Staphylococcus aureus, were found to carry determinants of resistance to a series of inorganic ions as well as resistance to penicillin and, in some cases, erythromycin. Most of the ions involved were inhibitory but not lethal to the bacteria; the resistance markers conferred an increase in resistance by comparison with susceptible organisms of between 3- and 100-fold, depending on the ion involved. Separate genetic loci for resistance to arsenate, arsenite, lead, cadmium, mercuric, and bismuth ions were demonstrated. Resistance to antimony and resistance to zinc were also found but were not separated genetically from resistance to arsenite and cadmium, respectively. The ion resistance markers appeared to form a cluster on the plasmid, with no other known marker within it. Naturally occurring plasmids were observed that lacked one or more of these ion resistance markers, as well as penicillinase-negative strains that were resistant to one or more of the ions. The patterns of markers carried by these various strains may provide some understanding of the evolution of a plasmid linkage group.

Joint elimination and joint transduction of the determinants of penicillinase production and resistance to macrolide antibiotics. J. Bacteriol. 89:988–992. 1965.—Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which show high resistance to macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, oleandomycin, leucomycin, and spiramycin) and the capacity to produce penicillinase, have been isolated from clinical sources. The determinants of penicillinase production (PCase+) and resistance to macrolide antibiotics (MACr) of these strains were irreversibly eliminated by treatment with acridine or with ultraviolet light. Among the 18 strains tested, PCase+ and MACr were eliminated from all strains except one, which lost only PCase+ but not MACr. The characters PCase+ and MACr were jointly transduced with the aid of phage lysates, obtained from the resistant donors by ultraviolet irradiation, into staphylococcal strains sensitive to PC and MAC. Segregation of PCase+ and MACr was rarely observed after transduction. From these results, it is suggested that the determinants of both PCase+ and MACr of staphylococci are located close together on a single genetic element, i.e., a plasmid (or episome), which exists extrachromosomally.

Recombination-deficient mutants of Staphylococcus aureus have been isolated and found to have properties similar to those of recombination-deficient Escherichia coli. In addition, one Rec– mutant was found to be defective in the restriction and modification of DNA. There is a marked reduction (∼ 104-fold) in recombination between penicillinase plasmids in the Rec– mutants suggesting that these elements do not encode an efficient recombination system. There is, however, a demonstrable residuum of interplasmid recombination; evidence is lacking on whether this residuum is a plasmid or host function. In the absence of the generalized host recombination system it has been possible to demonstrate that interplasmid recombination occurs during vegetative bacteriophage growth and is presumably mediated by a phage-determined recombination system.

The genetic basis of cadmium resistance conferred by three penicillinase plasmids, PI524, PI258, and PII147, of Staphylococcus aureus was examined by mutation, recombination, and deletion analysis. Three separate loci were identified: cadA, responsible for high-level resistance; cadB, giving a low-level resistance, nonadditive to cadA; and mad, a locus marginally decreasing the cadmium resistance of plasmid-positive staphylococci. The loci cadA and mad were present on all three plasmids, but cadB was only found on PII147. Spontaneous deletions of mad involved up to three-fourths of the plasmid genome, which allowed derivation of a partial deletion map of PII147, a plasmid with a contour length of 10.9 μm, corresponding to a molecular weight of 20.4 × 106.

Transformation of Staphylococcus aureus cells with circular duplex deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from plasmid-carrying strains by alkali denaturation and selective renaturation or by dye-buoyant density centrifugation is reported. In all of the transformants tested, the transformed markers became established as autonomous plasmids that were biologically and physically indistinguishable from those carried by the donor strains. Transformation with bulk deoxyribonucleic acid from a strain carrying the penicillinase plasmid, PI258, gave rise to transformants in which the erythromycin locus, the only plasmid marker transformed, was shown to be integrated into the host chromosome.

A series of plasmids harbored by naturally occurring penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were surveyed with a view toward exploring the variability in plasmid-linked marker patterns. Plasmids were transduced from their natural hosts to either of two plasmid-negative laboratory strains by selection for cadmium resistance, and the transductants were tested for all other markers previously found to be plasmid-linked. All of the strains that were able to serve as genetic donors to one of the two stock strains could donate cadmium and lead resistance as linked, plasmid-borne markers. Among the other plasmid markers, a wide variety of patterns was found, including four plasmids that did not carry the penicillinase determinant. Each of the 26 plasmids studied, including the latter 4, was found to belong to one of the two incompatibility sets of penicillinase plasmids previously identified. With the exception of the penicillinase-negative plasmids, which were found in both sets, all the plasmids of incompatibility set I directed the production of penicillinase type A; those belonging to set II directed either type A or type C. Those of set II without exception increased the sensitivity of their host strains to bismuth ion; those of set I carried determinants of bismuth resistance or did not affect the sensitivity of their host to this ion. No other perfect correlations between markers were encountered; in particular, there was no correlation between penicillinase serotype and the excretion of the enzyme. This finding allows the prediction that there is, in addition to all of the markers thus far identified, a plasmid-linked determinant of penicillinase excretion.

Bacteriophage PBP1 is a flagella-specific virus that performs generalized transduction in strains of Bacillus pumilus. PBP1 is morphologically and serologically distinct from two other flagella-specific phages, PBS1 and SP-15, which perform generalized transduction in certain Bacillus species. The DNA extracted from PBP1 particles has a buoyant density of 1.690 g/cm3 in cesium chloride gradients, a melting temperature of 86.1 C, and a sedimentation velocity of 47S in neutral sucrose gradients. Assuming the molecule is a linear duplex, PBP1 DNA has a molecular weight of approximately 76 × 106. In two strains of B. pumilus which are sensitive to both PBP1 and PBS1, co-transducible genetic markers are more tightly linked by PBS1 transduction than by PBP1 transduction. The size of the fragment of bacterial DNA carried by PBP1-transducing particles, inferred from transduction studies and sedimentation analysis of viral DNA, suggests that PBP1 may be useful for genetic studies of extrachromosomal DNA elements present in two strains of B. pumilus. Genetic exchange of chromosomally located genes between the plasmid+ and plasmid-B. pumilus strains NRS 576 and NRRL B-3275 has been demonstrated by PBP1 transduction.

Approximately 3% of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Bacillus pumilus NRS576 can be isolated as covalently closed, circular duplex molecules of homogeneous size. The mol wt of the 576 plasmid is approximately 30 million. NRS576 (plasmid+) is oligosporogenic; less than 1% of the cells form spores during incubation in liquid AK sporulation medium. Variants that form spores at a high frequency (greater than 50% spores in 24 h) occur spontaneously at a frequency of approximately 10−5. More than 25 such variants have been examined and all lack detectable plasmid DNA. A relationship appears to exist between the oligosporogenic properties of NRS576 and the presence of the 576 plasmid.Images	Plasmid in Bacillus pumilus and the Enhanced Sporulation of Plasmid-Negative Variants	Paul S.

EcoR1 endonuclease digested the Bacillus pumilus plasmid pPL576 (molecular weight similar to 28 X 10-6) into three distinct size classes of linear fragments. The molecular weights of the fragments are 13.0 X 10-6, 0.5 X 10-6, and 6.5 X 10-6 by sucrose gradient analysis. By electron microscope analysis the three fragments account for about 99% of the intact plasmid. These results indicate that pPL576 molecules contain a nonrandom base sequence, and are consistent with the interpretation that pPL576 is autonomous and not the result of cyclization of random chromosome fragments.

The enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing β-lactamases, all of them R-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. Four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of −0.1 cm/h. Eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. The remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (−0.1 cm/h). All the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. The two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.

Bacterial and plasmid homo- and heteroduplexes have been analyzed with a single-strand specific endonuclease, S1, of Aspergillus oryzae. Under appropriate assay conditions, there was a high degree of correlation between the degree of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-DNA homoduplex formation assessed by the S1 endonuclease and by hydroxyapatite (HA). Heteroduplexes which contain extensive regions of polynucleotide sequences in common are similarly recognized by the S1 endonuclease and HA. In instances where there is little or imperfect complementarity between heterologous DNA strands, the S1 endonuclease and the HA method give slightly different estimates. From DNA duplex thermal stability experiments assayed with the S1 endonuclease, there is preliminary evidence that well-matched sequences identified by the enzyme are not similarly recognized by HA. The assay of homo- and heteroduplexes with the S1 endonuclease permits an accurate, reproducible and rapid determination of polynucleotide sequence relationships and may be seriously considered as a method of choice for survey work and for investigations which require a large number of DNA-DNA hybridization assays.

Two infectious drug-resistance (R) factors, R28K and R6K, each conferring resistance to a number of penicillins by the synthesis of a penicillinase, were transferred to Proteus mirabilis PM1 and Escherichia coli RC85 host strains. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from these strains was separated by density-gradient centrifugation and subjected to electron microscopy by use of a modification of the protein-monolayer diffusion technique. Analytical density-gradient centrifugation of the purified DNA from PM1 strains showed, in addition to the major peak at a density of 1.698 g/cm3 characteristic of Proteus chromosomal DNA, a single satellite band at a density of 1.710 g/cm3 [guanine plus cytosine (GC) base ratio 50%] for R28K and at 1.704 g/cm3 (GC base ratio 45%) for R6K. Direct CsCl density-gradient centrifugation of crude lysates of the E. coli (R28K)+ strain in the presence of ethidium bromide gave rise to a sedimentation profile with a single satellite peak containing covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA molecules with a mean contour length of 21.4 μm [44 × 106 atomic mass units (AMU)], although a minority was 13.6 μm in length. From the size of the major class, it was estimated that there were two to three copies of the R28K factor present as CCC molecules per chromosome at various phases of cellular growth. Similar studies of the E. coli (R6K)+ lysates showed two satellite peaks; peak I contained mostly CCC molecules of contour length 12.8 μm (26 × 106 AMU), and peak II, intermediate to peak I and the chromosomal peak, contained CCC molecules of a similar size, together with about equal numbers of catenated molecules, mostly dimers consisting of two interlocked monomers of 12.8 μm. A smaller number (ca. 0.1%) of higher catenanes was also seen. The number of CCC copies of the R6K factor per chromosome present in peak I was calculated as 13 at logarithmic phase and 38 at stationary phase. In peak II, a constant ratio of about one catenated dimer per chromosome was found at all phases of growth. Penicillinase assays of cultures at different phases of growth showed a correlation between the estimated number of R-factor copies present as CCC molecules and the enzyme activity per cell for both R28K and R6K.Images	Circular R-Factor Molecules Controlling Penicillinase Synthesis, Replicating in Escherichia coli Under Either Relaxed or Stringent Control	Polyxeni Kontomichalou, Michiko Mitani, Royston C.

Deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization studies reveal that the plasmids coding for the production of heat stable and heat labile enteroxtoxins of Escherichia coli, regardless of their origin, have a majority of their polynucleotide sequences in common, but are not related in any significant way to those plasmids coding for the synthesis of only ST toxin. The heat stable and heat labile plasmids also share a significant degree of their polynucleotide sequences with plasmids of the FI and FII incompatibility groups, but not with R factors belonging to the I, N, W, P, or X incompatibility groups.

A genetic marker responsible for the killing activity of PBSX, a defective phage carried by Bacillus subtilis 168, has been located on the bacterial chromosome. Two mutant strains of B. subtilis 168, which produced tailless phage particles upon mitomycin C induction, were shown to carry lesions, designated xtl-1 and xtl-2, which were linked by transformation and PBS1-mediated transduction to metC. The link-age relationship between xtl and adjacent auxotrophic markers was determined by three-factor PBS1 transduction, the suggested order of markers being argO 1 metA metC xtl.

A clear plaque mutant of the temperate Bacillus phage φ105 lysogenized a small fraction of infected cells forming an integrated prophage at or near the normal φ105 insertion site. These lysogens exhibited a spontaneous induction rate approximately 1,000-fold lower than wild type and were noninducible (ind-) by mitomycin C. Prophage was induced, however, when competent cultures were incubated with transforming DNA. The ind- phenotype could not be attributed solely to the clear plaque mutation and appears to involve a cell-specific factor. Lysogenization by the clear plaque mutant, in contrast to wild-type phage, did not cause a marked reduction in transformation efficiency.

The Escherichia coli mutator genes mutU4, mutS3, and mut-25 (a possible allele of mutL), previously known to induce transitional base changes, increased significantly the frequencies of reversion of lacZ frameshift mutations. mutT1, previously shown to induce only the transversion of adenine-thymine to cytosine-guanine, had no effect on the reversion of lacZ frameshift mutations. With mutator genes other than mutT1, small increases were found in the frequencies of reversion of trpA frameshift mutations.

A mutant strain of E. coli, initially identified by an abnormally high frequency of recombination, has been found to be defective in the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease associated with DNA polymerase I, but not in the polymerase activity. This defect is tolerated at 30°, but is lethal at 43°. Like other polymerase I mutants, the strain is unusually sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate and to ultraviolet irradiation; it is also unable to support the growth of phage λ defective in general recombination, and shows a reduced rate of joining of 10S “Okazaki fragments.” These results demonstrate that a functional DNA polymerase I is essential for normal growth and viability in E. coli K12.

To clarify the relationship between thymineless death and thymineless mutagenesis, the induction of arginine revertants of Escherichia coli TAU-bar by thymine starvation was examined in physiological terms. Induced revertants were detectable both on minimal medium lacking arginine and minimal medium supplemented with 1 μg of arginine per ml. Substantial thymineless mutagenesis occurred during the period before the onset of thymineless death. Mutagenesis and loss of viability were observed upon incubation in medium lacking thymine and arginine, and both were inhibited upon incubation in medium lacking thymine and uracil. Mutagenesis also occurred during thymine starvation at 25 C, where there was relatively little loss of viability. At 37 C thymineless mutagenesis did not require complete thymine starvation, and the induction of revertants appeared to be initiated at the same suboptimal thymine concentration at which lethality was first detectable. Mutagenesis was found not to occur preferentially at the growing point of deoxyribonucleic acid replication. These results suggest that thymineless mutagenesis does not involve simply errors in base pairing due to the absence of thymine. The data also suggest that the induction of mutations and thymineless death are due to the same primary event but that mutagenesis is the more sensitive response.

ICR-191, an acridine half-mustard known to cause frameshift mutations in bacteria, was used to induce Lac− mutations revertible by ICR-191. The reversion rates of several of these mutations were stimulated approximately twofold by the presence of lac inducer. The stimulatory effect of inducer was attributable to gene induction rather than some other effect of inducer, since inducer did not stimulate reversion in a regulator constitutive strain. The stimulatory effect was not observed unless the gene to be reverted was induced during the period of exposure to ICR-191. The presence of a strong polar (nonsense) mutation on the operator side of a frameshift mutation abolished the stimulatory effect of inducer on reversion of the frameshift mutation by ICR-191. (As expected, a nonpolar mutation on the operator side of the frameshift mutation did not affect inducer-stimulated reversion.) It was concluded that some aspect of transcription or translation, or both, in the neighborhood of the ICR-191-induced mutation stimulated reversion by ICR-191. A recA mutation had no effect on reversion by ICR-191 in the presence or absence of inducer. In one mutant, gene induction depressed reversion by ICR-191 about sevenfold. The difference between this exceptional strain and other mutants was not attributable to different genetic backgrounds but seemed to be an inherent difference in the original Lac− mutations.

Certain genetic, structural, and biochemical properties of a class 2 R-factor system consisting of the conjugally proficient transfer plasmid I and the naturally occurring non-conjugative tetracycline (Tc) resistance plasmid 219 are reported. I and 219 exist as separate plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) species in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella panama, having molecular weights of 42 × 106 and 5.8 × 106, respectively. The buoyant densities of I and 219 are 1.702 and 1.710 g/cm3, respectively, in neutral cesium chloride. Although the Tc resistance plasmid is not transmissible in a normal conjugal mating, it is mobilized in a three-component mating by plasmid I and by certain other conjugative plasmids of the fi+ or fi− phenotype. Mobilization does not appear to involve intermolecular recombination between plasmids, and no covalent linkage of resistance markers and fertility functions is observed. Transformation of CaCl2-treated E. coli by plasmid DNA is shown to be a useful procedure for studying the biological properties of different plasmid molecular species that have been fractionated in vitro, and for selectively inserting non-self-transmissible plasmids into specific bacterial strains. The effects of tetracycline on the rate of protein synthesis carried out by plasmid 219 were studied by using isolated E. coli minicells into which this plasmid had segregated. Consistent with the results of earlier investigations showing the inducibility of plasmid-mediated Tc resistance in E. coli, the antibiotic was observed to stimulate protein synthesis in minicells carrying the plasmid 219 and totally inhibit 3H-leucine incorporation by minicells lacking the Tc resistance marker. Five discrete polypeptide species were synthesized by minicells carrying plasmid 219; exposure of minicells or parent bacteria to Tc resulted in specific and reproducible changes in polypeptide synthesis patterns.

A covalently-closed circular DNA species, banding at a buoyant density of ρ = 1.709 g/cm3 in CsCl, has been identified in antibiotic-sensitive colonies of E. coli strain AB2463 (rec A-) after mating with a Proteus mirabilis strain that carries the R-factor, R1. This plasmid, which represents a stable segregant of R1 that has lost all of the drug resistance determinants present on the parent R-factor but which has retained its ability to be transferred by conjugation, fulfills the functional definition of the R-factor transfer unit (RTF).

A variant of the derepressed R factor, R1, which does not contain any of the drug resistance markers, and represents, in large part, the resistance transfer factor (RTF) was studied in Escherichia coli. RTF deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was specifically labeled in a female cell after conjugation. Physical characterization of the molecule showed that RTF possessed an average molecular weight of 50 × 106 daltons and a buoyant density of 1.709 g/cm3. By comparison to R1, we calculate that the region of DNA carrying the drug resistance genes is therefore about 20% of the R1 molecule and has a buoyant density of approximately 1.716 g/cm3. These results support the hypothesis that the single species of R-factor DNA observed in E. coli represents a composite of the 1.709 and 1.716 g/cm3 replicons seen in Proteus.

Bacterial strains showing linked resistance to streptomycin (Sm) and sulfonamides (Su) were chosen representing a wide taxonomic and geographical range. Their SmSu resistances were transferred to Escherichia coli K-12 and then plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated by ethidium bromide CsCl centrifugation. The plasmid DNA was examined by electron microscopy and analyzed by sedimentation through 5 to 20% neutral sucrose gradients. Plasmid DNA from strains having transmissible SmSu resistance consisted of two or three molecular species, one of which had a molecular mass of about 5.7 Mdal (106 daltons), the others varying between 20 to 60 Mdal. By using transformation or F′ mobilization, we isolated the SmSu-resistance determinant from any fellow resident plasmids in each strain and again isolated the plasmid DNA. Cosedimentation of each of these with a differently labeled reference plasmid DNA (R300B) showed 9 out of 12 of the plasmids to have a molecular mass not significantly different from the reference (5.7 Mdal); two others were 6.3 and 9.2 Mdal, but PB165 consisted of three plasmids of 7.4, 14.7, and 21.4 Mdal. Three separate isolations of the SmSu determinant from PB165 gave the same three plasmids, which we conclude may be monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridizations at 75 C demonstrated 80 to 93% homology between reference R300B DNA and each isolated SmSu plasmid DNA, except for the 9.2-Mdal plasmid which had 45% homology and PB165 which had 35%. All the SmSu plasmids were present as multiple copies (about 10) per chromosome. The conjugative plasmid of R300 (present as 1.3 copies per chromosome) has been shown to have negligible effect on the number of copies of its accompanying SmSu plasmid R300B. We conclude that the SmSu plasmids are closely related and probably have a common evolutionary origin.Images	Comparison of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid Molecular Weights and Homologies of Plasmids Conferring Linked Resistance to Streptomycin and Sulfonamides	Peter T.

Two of seven sucrose-fermenting Salmonella strains obtained from clinical sources were found capable of conjugal transfer of the sucrose fermentation (Scr+) property to the Escherichia coli K-12 strain WR3026. The genetic elements conferring this Scr+ property, designated scr-53 and scr-94, were then conjugally transmissible from Escherichia coli WR3026 Scr+ exconjugants to other strains of Escherichia coli at frequences of 5 times 10- minus 6 to 5 times 10- minus 3 for the scr-53 element and 10- minus 6 to 10- minus 5 for the scr-94 element. In Escherichia coli hosts, both of these elements were compatible with F-lac and with each of six previously characterized transmissible lac elements. No antibiotic resistance characteristics or colicin production were discovered to be associated with either scr-53 or scr-94. Neither scr element generated a male host response to the female-specific phage phiII, but the scr-53 element rendered its Escherichia coli host sensitive to the male-specific phage R-17. Escherichia coli hosts containing scr-53 were susceptible to lysis by P1vir, and transduction of the scr-53 element was accomplished with this phage. The scr-53 element was isolated from Escherichia coli WR3026, Scr+ transductants, and Escherichia coli WR2036 Scr+ exconjugants as a covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid molecule with a molecular weight (determined by electron microscopy) of approximately 52 times 10-6. Receipt of the scr-94 element rendered Escherichia coli hosts of this element unsusceptible to lysis by P1vir, although adsorption of the phage by an Escherichia coli WR3026 exconjugant containing scr-94 occurred as efficiently as it did on WR3026 itself. Repeated examination of Escherichia coli strains harboring scr-94, as well as of the Salmonella strain which initially contained it, did not reveal the presence of circular deoxyribonucleic acid. The synthesis of the sucrose cleaving enzyme was inducible in Escherichia coli exconjugants containing either scr-53 or scr-94.

Circular deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated from Shigella dysenteriae Y6R and was found to consist of six species having molecular weights of 106, 1.3 × 106, 2.6 × 106, 3.8 × 106, 20 × 106, and 24 × 106 daltons. These size classes were partially resolved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The minicircles (106 and 1.3 × 106) were found to have a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.710 g/ml. The 3.8 × 106 dalton class had a density of 1.707 g/ml. The two largest species had a density of 1.702 g/ml. Two other strains, S. sonnei II and S. dysenteriae 60, also contained circular deoxyribonucleic acid.Images	Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid from Shigella dysenteriae Y6R	Mark G. Rush, C. N.

Three previously studied R factors were used: 222/R4, controlling transmissible resistance to sulfonamide, streptomycin, chloromycetin, and tetracycline (SUr SMr CMr TCr); 222/R3, a derivative of 222/R4 (now termed 222/R3W) having lost TCr; and R15, controlling infectious resistance to SU and SM only. Two types of derivative R factors were isolated from 222/R4 by serial subculture in Salmonella species. One derivative, termed 222/R1, lost resistance to SU, SM, and CM, and the other, termed 222/R3N, lost only TCr. Each factor was transferred to a standard Escherichia coli K-12 host. Recombinant factors of 222/R4 phenotype were isolated by selection after mixed culture of E. coli (222/R1)+ and (222/R3N)+ strains. Density-gradient equilibrium centrifugation of lysates of E. coli R+ hosts in the presence of ethidium bromide separated R-factor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a heavy satellite peak which was subjected to electron microscopy or analytical density gradient centrifugation. Each DNA comprised a unimolecular species of circular DNA. The contour of R15 measured 22.3 μm [equivalent to 46 × 106 atomic mass units (AMU)], and that of 222/R4 measured 33.6 μm (70 × 106 AMU). 222/R3W appeared to be a point mutant or small deletion of 222/R4 with an almost identical size, whereas 222/R3N had lost a DNA segment of about 3 μm, and measured 30.3 μm or 63 × 106 AMU. The 222/R1 factors also appeared to have arisen by loss of DNA from 222/R4, 222/R1A being 22.3 μm or 46 × 106 AMU, whereas all other 222/R1 factors appeared to be duplicates, measuring 25.6 μm or 53 × 106 AMU. The DNA from six recombinant factors of R4 phenotype was indistinguishable in size and configuration from the parental 222/R4. In most cases, the number of R-factor copies (present as covalently closed circular molecules) per copy of the E. coli chromosome was less than 2, ranging from 1.2 to 3.3.Images	Molecular Recombination Between R-Factor Deoxyribonucleic Acid Molecules in Escherichia coli Host Cells	Taizo Nisioka, Michiko Mitani, Royston C.

Covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules were isolated by cesium chloride centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide from a naturally occurring beta-hemolytic Escherichia coli strain (SC52). The open circular forms have contour lengths of 2.25 ± 0.1 μm, 24.0 ± 0.3 μm, and 29.5 ± 0.5 μm. The beta-hemolytic character of E. coli SC52 can be transferred by conjugation to a nonhemolytic recipient strain. Analysis of the supercoiled DNA of the hemolytic recipient demonstrated that the two large supercoiled DNA molecules of E. coli SC52 are transferred during this event, too. A beta-hemolytic laboratory E. coli strain and several of its derivatives have been shown to contain at least one circular DNA molecule, slightly larger in size than those isolated from E. coli SC52 and its conjugant. The possible significance of these DNA molecules for hemolysin production and transfer is discussed.Images	Isolation and Characterization of Supercoiled Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid from Beta-Hemolytic Strains of Escherichia coli	Werner Goebel, Hildgund Schrempf	4929855	1971-05-01	9	
The physical properties of F-like and I-like R factors have been compared with those of the wild-type F factor in Escherichia coli K-12 unmated cells and after transfer to recipient cells by conjugation. The F-like R factor R538-1drd was found to have a molecular weight of 49 × 106, whereas the molecular weight of the I-like R factor R64drd11 was 76 × 106. The wild-type F factor, F1, had a molecular weight of 62 × 106. When conjugation experiments are performed by using donor strains carrying these derepressed F-like or I-like R factors, the transferred deoxyribonucleic acid can be isolated as a covalently closed circle from the recipient cells. This circular deoxyribonucleic acid was characterized by making use of the observation that the complementary strands of these R factors can be separated in a CsCl-poly (U, G) equilibrium gradient. The results of the strand-separation experiments show that only one of the complementary strands of the R factor is transferred from the donor to the recipient. With both the F-like and I-like R factors, this strand is the heavier strand in CsCl-poly (U, G). These results indicate that even though F-like and I-like R factors differ greatly in many properties (phage specificity, size, compatability, etc.), they are transferred by a similar mechanism.Images	Physical Properties and Mechanism of Transfer of R Factors in Escherichia coli	Daniel Vapnek, Muriel B.

Replication of the 50 and 58 moles per cent guanine plus cytosine (%GC) components of R factor 222 in Proteus mirabilis during growth in the presence and absence of chloramphenicol and after shifting exponential- and stationary-phase cells to conditions which inhibit host protein or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was examined. Chloramphenicol reduced the growth rate but increased the amount of both R-factor components; the 58% GC component showed a larger proportionate increase. This was inferred to indicate reduced synthesis of an inhibitor that acts on both R-factor components and an initiator for replication of the 50% GC component. Replicative patterns observed after shifting exponential- and stationary-phase cells grown with or without chloramphenicol to minimal medium or chloramphenicol for one generation, or puromycin for 3 hr, corroborated this interpretation. After shifts of exponential cells from either medium, replication of the 50% GC components paralleled host replication, thus indicating a requirement for protein synthesis; replication of the 58% GC component increased due to reduced inhibitor synthesis. R-factor DNA remained constant after shifting stationary cells from drug-free medium, thus indicating that the cells contained effective concentrations of the regulatory inhibitor, whereas increased replication of the 58% GC component occurred after identical shifts of chloramphenicol-grown cells of the same chronological age. Similar responses were observed after shifts to 5 C or to medium containing streptomycin or tetracycline. Absence of replication of the 50% GC component after shifting to medium containing nalidixic acid or phenethanol and its hereditary persistence during growth indicated that the 50% GC replicon was attached to the membrane. Thus, in P. mirabilis the three replicons of R factor 222 are regulated as follows: The composite and transfer portion (RTF) replicons represented by the 50% GC component require protein synthesis and membrane attachment and are negatively regulated by an inhibitor; the 58% GC or resistance-determinants replicon exists cytoplasmically and is subject only to negative control.

The progeny cells of Escherichia coli strain P678-54, which normally do not contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), were found to carry DNA when the parental cell carried colicin factor E1 (Col E1).

Unlike the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-deficient minicells produced by F− parents, minicells produced by plasmid-containing strains contain significant amounts of plasmid DNA. We examined the ability of plasmid-containing minicells to synthesize ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein. In vivo, minicells produced by F− parents are unable to incorporate radioactive precursors into acid-insoluble RNA or protein, whereas minicells produced by F′, R+, or Col+ parents are capable of such synthesis. Using a variety of approaches, including polyacrylamide gel analysis of the RNA species produced and electron microscope autoradiography, we demonstrated that the synthesis observed in minicell preparations is a property of the plasmid-containing minicells and not a result of the few cells (approximately 1 per 106 minicells) contaminating the preparations. That the observed synthesis is of biological importance is suggested by the ability of plasmid-containing minicells to yield viable phage upon infection with T4.

Purified minicells of Escherichia coli K-12 containing the plasmid Col-trp+ or Col-trpA2 could be derepressed for the synthesis of anthranilate synthase, the first enzyme encoded in the trp operon. Non-plasmid-containing, deoxyribonucleic acid-deficient minicells could not be derepressed. Derepressed enzyme synthesis was initiated by l-tryptophan starvation. The kinetics of derepression were studied with minicells containing the Col-trpA2 plasmid. The derepression curves were biphasic with a rapid initial rate of enzyme synthesis followed by a slower rate of synthesis. The presence of l-tryptophan (20 to 50 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (200 μg/ml) abolished enzyme synthesis. The presence of rifamycin SV (280 μg/ml) partially inhibited enzyme synthesis after at least 3.5 min of exposure. The ratio of minicell-to-cell synthetic capacity was 1:2.4 when compared on the basis of derepressed enzyme activity per unit cell volume. This work demonstrates that plasmid-containing minicells are capable of considerable functional protein and messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis and that the regulation of at least the trp operon is similar in minicells to that observed in cells.

Genes carried by EcoRI endonuclease-generated fragments of Staphylococcus plasmid DNA have been covalently joined to the E. coli antibiotic-resistance plasmid pSC101, and the resulting hybrid molecules have been introduced into E. coli by transformation. The newly constructed plasmids replicate as biologically functional units in E. coli, and express genetic information carried by both of the parent DNA molecules. In addition, electron microscope heteroduplex analysis of the recombinant plasmids indicate that they contain DNA sequences derived from E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Recombinant molecules can transform other E. coli cells for penicillin-resistance markers originally carried by the staphylococcal plasmid, and can be transferred among E. coli strains by conjugally proficient transfer plasmids.Images	Genome Construction Between Bacterial Species In Vitro: Replication and Expression of Staphylococcus Plasmid Genes in Escherichia coli	Annie C.

Host mutations in Escherichia coli K12 selected for the temperature-sensitive replication of the bacterial plasmid colicinogenic factor E1 (ColE1) exhibit a pleiotropic effect with respect to the effect of the mutation on other extra-chromosomal elements. The mutations also vary with respect to the time of incubation of the cells at 43°C required for complete cessation of ColE1 DNA synthesis. While the synthesis of the bacterial chromosome appears unaffected, supercoiled ColE1 DNA replication stops immediately in some mutants and gradually decreases during several generations of cell growth before stopping in others. Mutations isolated in the ColE1 plasmid resulted in only a gradual cessation of ColE1 DNA synthesis over several generations of cell growth at 43°C. Conjugal transfer of the ColE1 and ColV factors occurs normally in the host mutants when the transfer is carried out at the permissive temperature; however, the presence of a group I mutation in the donor cell prohibited conjugal transfer of either plasmid DNA at 43°C to a normal recipient cell. Similarly, the presence of this mutation in the recipient prevented the establishment of ColE1 or ColV in the mutant recipient cell upon conjugation with a normal donor at 43°C. Various host ColE1 replication mutants carrying either ColE1 or ColE2 were also defective in the mitomycin C-induced production of colicin E1 or colicin E2 at 43°C. The majority of the host mutations examined exhibited a temperature sensitivity to growth in deoxycholate in addition to the inhibition of plasmid DNA replication, suggesting a membrane alteration in these mutants when grown at the restrictive temperature.

The genes specifying enzymes responsible for the degradation of camphor and octane occur on transmissible plasmids in Pseudomonas putida strain PpG1 and P. oleovorans. Since the presence of the plasmids is vital for the oxidative metabolism of camphor or octane (by the cells) in the absence of other carbon sources, such naturally occurring, energy-generating plasmids have been designated as degradative plasmids. The two degradative plasmids, CAM and OCT, are incompatible with each other and cannot coexist in the same cell. By the use of UV irradiation and suitable selection techniques, it has been possible to fuse these two plasmids so they become part of the same replicon and coexist. Such a technique might be useful in introducing several degradative pathways in the same cell.	Genetic Fusion of Incompatible Plasmids in Pseudomonas	A. M. Chakrabarty	4515925	1973-06-01	9	
RP1, a group of genes specifying resistance to carbenicillin, neomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline and originating in a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was freely transmissible between strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. Acquisition of the multiple drug resistance specified by RP1 by these strains was accompanied by acquisition of an extrachromosomal satellite of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of molecular weight about 40 million daltons and of buoyant density 1.719 g/cm3 (60% guanine plus cytosine).

Three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated to transfer double-drug resistance by conjugation to a P. aeruginosa recipient at frequencies of 10−4 to 10−2 per recipient cell. Two of the three strains also transferred to Escherichia coli at frequencies which were 103- to 105-fold lower, but the third strain could not be demonstrated to do so. The latter strain, however, conferred maleness on the Pseudomonas recipient. The transfer of streptomycin resistance was associated with the acquisition of streptomycin phosphorylase by both P. aeruginosa and E. coli recipients. Maximal broth mating frequencies were obtained with nonagitated cultures less than 1 mm in depth. A pyocine selection system based on donor sensitivity and recipient resistance is described and appears to have future value as a generalized selective device for use after matings.

Previously described penicillinase-constitutive mutations in Staphylococcus aureus are caused by genetic lesions in a regulator gene (or genes) on the penicillinase plasmid in close linkage to the structural gene. This report describes a new class (R2−) of penicillinase-constitutive mutants of S. aureus unlinked to the plasmid. By transductional analysis, the penicillinase plasmids in these mutants were wild type. Wild-type plasmids transduced into penicillinase-negative (plasmid loss) derivatives of R2− mutants produced penicillinase constitutively in amounts comparable to a fully induced culture of the wild-type strain. Penicillinase production in R2− mutants was maximal at 30 to 32 C and was much reduced at 40 C.

Schwartz, Norman M. (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.). Genetic instability in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 89:712–717. 1965.—Results obtained from a transductional analysis demonstrated that an extremely unstable reversion of lac− is a suppressor mutation. This mutation suppresses 2 of 22 different lac− alleles tested. Five different Hfr strains transferred the suppressor soon after mating and at low frequency. Acridine orange enhanced the segregation of lac− clones from the unstable suppressed mutant. Stable suppressed lac− clones were produced by the unstable suppressed mutant. Two such stable suppressors were transferred at high frequency and mapped at different chromosomal sites on the basis of time of entry data. One of the stable suppressed lac− mutants reverted to the unstable suppressed lac− state. It is proposed that the suppressor is carried on an extrachromosomal element. The differences in stability observed may reflect differences in the state of the suppressor-bearing element.	Genetic Instability in Escherichia coli	Norman M. Schwartz	14273650	1965-03-01	9

ε34 Is a converting bacteriophage which brings about a glucosylation of the O antigen in the E group salmonella, thus producing antigen 34. Uridine diphosphate glucose is the precursor of antigen 34 and a glucosyl-lipid is an essential intermediate in this process. Mutants of ε34 which cannot produce antigen 34 have been isolated. Cells lysogenic for these mutants are of two types. Type 1 mutant lysogens cannot form the glucosyl-lipid intermediate; those of type 2 can form glucosyl-lipid but are unable to transfer glucose from the lipid to the O antigen.

Mitsuhashi, Susumu (Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan), Hiroshi Oshima, Umeko Kawaharada, and Hajime Hashimoto. Drug resistance of staphylococci. I. Transduction of tetracycline resistance with phage lysates obtained from multiply resistant staphylococci. J. Bacteriol. 89:967–976. 1965.—Tetracycline resistance was found to be transduced with phage lysates obtained from multiply resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus of human origin. With various combinations of multiply resistant donors and tetracycline (TC)-sensitive recipients, almost all of the strains were found to be competent donors. A greater percentage of group 1 staphylococci were competent recipients. Most of the TC+ transductants were not lysogenic for the transducing phage and were unable to transduce TC resistance with their own phage lysates obtained by ultraviolet irradiation. However, the TC+ transductants, lysogenized with transducing phage, were capable of transducing TC resistance, and some of the lysogenizations were accompanied by changes in phage type. These results suggest that the emergence of the multiply resistant staphylococci (consistently resistant to TC) can be accounted for by transduction among various strains accompanied sometimes by changes in phage typing pattern after lysogenization, and by selection through extensive use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents.

Transcription studies in vitro on repression of the tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli show that partially purified trp repressor binds specifically to DNA containing the trp operator with a repressor-operator dissociation constant of about 0.2 nM in 0.12 M salt at 37°, a value consistent with the extent of trp operon regulation in vivo. The half-life of the trp repressor-trp operator complex is less than 2 min in vitro in 0.12 M salt.	Interaction of the Operator of the Tryptophan Operon with Repressor	John K.

"Using a poly(dA-dT) ""connector"" method, a population of annealed hybrid circular DNAs was constructed in vitro; each hybrid DNA circle containing one full-length molecule of poly(dT)-tailed DNA from E1 colicinogenic factor (Col E1) fragmented by EcoRI endonuclease annealed to any one of a collection of poly(dA)-tailed linear DNA fragments of the entire E. coli genome. This annealed, but unligated, hybrid DNA was used to transform several different auxotrophic mutants of E. coli, and by direct selection, bacterial clones were isolated which contained specific hybrid plasmids. In this manner, bacterial strains containing Col E1 hybrid plasmids carrying the entire tryptophan operon or the arabinsoe and leucine operons were isolated. The methods described should allow the molecular cloning of any portion of the E. coli genome by selection from a pool of DNA molecules containing at least several hundred different hybrids representing the entire bacterial genome.Images"	Biochemical construction and selection of hybrid plasmids containing specific segments of the Escherichia coli genome.

Results show that many of the symmetrical and repetitive features seen in these interaction sites are likely to have occurred by chance. Other features are so unlikely to have occurred by chance that they are probably involved in the DNA-protein interaction processes.

Mutant strains of Escherichia coli have been isolated in which the synthesis of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase (phe) is derepressed, in addition to those enzymes of tyrosine biosynthesis previously shown to be controlled by the gene tyrR. The major enzyme of the terminal pathway of phenylalanine biosynthesis chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase is not derepressed in these strains. Genetic analysis of the mutants shows that the mutation or mutations causing derepression map close to previously reported tyrR mutations. A study of one of the mutations has shown it to be recessive to the wild-type allele in a diploid strain. It is proposed that the tyrR gene product is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of DAHP synthetase (phe) as well as the synthesis of DAHP synthetase (tyr), chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase, and transaminase A.

OBJECTIVE--To investigate the nature of ventricular activation and its relation with mechanical events in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN--Retrospective and prospective study with 12 lead electrocardiograms, signal averaged electrocardiograms, and M mode and Doppler echocardiograms. SETTING--Tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS--77 patients (mean (SD) age 59(13)) with dilated cardiomyopathy, four after aortic valve replacement and three after coronary bypass surgery, and six patients with a normal sized left ventricle and complete right bundle branch block were studied. 15 normal subjects (age 45(20)) were used as controls. RESULTS--In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, QRS duration was longer (127(25) ms v 90(10), P < 0.05) than normal and was normally distributed (r = 0.991, P < 0.01) on a normal probability plot. 20 had classic left bundle branch block, 29 intraventricular conduction delay, four right bundle branch block, and one bifascicular block. The PR interval was prolonged (185(30) ms v 150(15), P < 0.05). Electromechanical delay, Q to the onset of thickening of the interventricular septum as seen on the transverse M mode echocardiogram, was 75(15) ms in controls, but reduced to 43(15) ms in the patients (P < 0.01). Q to the onset of mitral regurgitation was also short (50(15)) ms, and correlated inversely with PR interval (r = -0.67, n = 73, P < 0.01). Early potentials (< 40 microV) were recorded on the signal averaged electrocardiogram in 33 representative patients and in all controls. Their overall duration was 30(12) ms in the patients, much longer than normal (12(7), P < 0.01)). Early potential time correlated positively with PR interval (r = 0.75, P < 0.01) and QRS duration (r = 0.60, P < 0.01) on a 12 lead electrocardiogram, and negatively with apparent electromechanical delay (r = -0.71, P < 0.01, n = 33), but not with true electromechanical delay (73(15)ms) or true PR interval (163(30)ms), calculated by correcting apparent values for early potential. The onset of left ventricular free wall motion was delayed with respect to the septum beyond 95% of the upper normal limit in all the patients with classic left bundle branch block and intraventricular conduction defect. Motion in the right ventricular free wall was delayed in 13 of 20 patients with left bundle branch block and 24 of 29 with intraventricular conduction defect by 65(20) ms, similar to that (75(10) ms) in patients with right bundle branch block. CONCLUSION--In most patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and an electrocardiographic pattern of left bundle branch block or intraventricular block, the onset of mechanical systole is strikingly and symmetrically delayed in both ventricles, compatible with bilateral bundle branch block. Complete atrioventricular block does not occur. The ventricle is activated through the upper septum and this activation is detectable only by signal averaged electrocardiography. The anatomical substrates for this abnormal activation could be the high connections described by Mahaim and Winston.

OBJECTIVE--To assess the diastolic effect of left bundle branch block in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN--Retrospective study of M mode and Doppler echocardiograms along with electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram. SETTING--Tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENT PARTICIPANTS--Fifty two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with functional mitral regurgitation. Twelve with left bundle branch block (group 1) were compared with 40 without (group 2). RESULTS--Mean (SD) age 60 (15) v 55 (18) years, left ventricular end diastolic dimension 72 (9) v 70 (7) mm, and heart rate 88 (15) v 84 (15) beats/min were similar in both groups. In patients with left bundle branch block the electromechanical delay, 50 (20) v 70 (20) ms, was shorter (p less than 0.05) whereas the preejection contraction time, measured from the onset of mitral regurgitation to that of aortic ejection, 130 (40) v 70 (20) ms (p less than 0.01), and left ventricular relaxation time, A2 to the end of mitral regurgitation, 130 (30) v 80 (30) ms (p less than 0.01), were both prolonged. Ejection time itself was similar, 230 (40) v 235 (40) ms. Thus the overall duration of mitral regurgitation was increased (495 (90) v 390 (60) ms (p less than 0.01], which made filling time shorter (190 (45) v 325 (90) ms (p less than 0.01]. In patients with left bundle branch block, unlike those without, contraction and relaxation times both shortened as RR interval fell; this made the duration of mitral regurgitation more sensitive to heart rate. Filling time was less than 200 ms in eight out of 12 patients with left bundle branch block and four out of 40 patients without (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION--Left bundle branch block prolongs rather than delays mitral regurgitation by increasing pre-ejection and relaxation times. This directly impairs diastolic function by shortening the time available for the left ventricule to fill to an extent likely to limit stroke volume.

OBJECTIVE--To compare the different effects of right ventricular pacing and classic left bundle branch block on left ventricular function. DESIGN--Retrospective and prospective study of 48 patients by electrocardiography, and M mode, cross sectional, and Doppler echocardiography. SETTING--A tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS--48 patients (age range 21 to 89 years, 15 women), 24 with a VVI pacemaker implanted and 24 with classic left bundle branch block. Functional mitral regurgitation was present in all those with right ventricular pacing and 22 of those with left bundle branch block. RESULTS--Age, RR interval, and left ventricular size were similar in the two groups, as were conventional measurements of overall systolic function: shortening fraction and pre-ejection and aortic ejection times. In right ventricular pacing, however, QRS duration (p < 0.01) and electromechanical delay were much longer (p < 0.001), whereas the time intervals from onset of mitral regurgitation to aortic opening (contraction time) and from A 2 to the end of mitral regurgitation (relaxation time) were consistently shorter (p < 0.01) than corresponding values in patients with left bundle branch block. Reversed splitting of the second heart sound was much commoner in left bundle branch block (p < 0.02), and only these patients showed an early systolic ventricular septal contraction. Its onset followed the initial deflection of the QRS complex by 40(15) ms and preceded mitral regurgitation by a small but consistent interval of 10 ms (p < 0.01). The onset of posterior wall thickening was synchronous with the onset of mitral regurgitation in right ventricular pacing but much later (p < 0.01) in patients with left bundle branch block. The extent of incoordinate wall motion measure as relative dimension change during pre-ejection and isovolumic relaxation period was much greater (p < 0.01) in left bundle branch block. These major differences were not altered by left ventricular cavity size in either group, nor by the presence of previous left bundle branch block in patients who were subsequently paced. CONCLUSIONS--The left ventricle seems to be activated much more rapidly with right ventricular pacing than with left bundle branch block. This applies even when left bundle branch block is present before pacing. Electromechanical delay, contraction and relaxation times, and extent of incoordinate ventricular wall motion differ strikingly between the two conditions. The use of right ventricular pacing as an experimental model of left bundle branch block in humans must be re-examined.

The role of longitudinally and circumferentially oriented fibres in left ventricular wall motion was examined by digitising echocardiograms of the mitral ring (whose motion reflects long axis change) and of the standard minor axis in 36 healthy individuals, 36 patients with coronary artery disease, 16 with left ventricular hypertrophy, 44 with mitral valve disease (24 of whom had undergone mitral valve replacement). In the controls long axis shortening significantly preceded minor axis shortening (mean (1 SD) difference 25 (40) ms) so that the minor axis increased more during isovolumic contraction (0.25 v 0.09 cm), indicating that the left ventricle became more spherical. Changes in the long and short axes were synchronous at end ejection and in early diastole in the controls. Epicardial excursion preceded endocardial excursion by 50 (20) ms at its peak. These time relations were consistently disturbed in all patient groups, irrespective of the extent of fractional shortening of the minor axis. The onset of long axis shortening was delayed, and this was often associated with premature shortening of the minor axis, the normal spherical shape change during isovolumic contraction was lost, and peak epicardial and endocardial changes became more synchronous. In patients with coronary disease these changes are the expected consequence of ischaemic injury to longitudinally orientated subendocardial fibres. In left ventricular hypertrophy their presence consistently showed systolic dysfunction when orthodox measures were still normal. They were more pronounced after mitral valve replacement when the papillary muscles had been sectioned; long axis shortening was reduced during systole and prolonged into early diastole, while normal shortening of the minor axis was maintained only by abnormal epicardial excursion. Relations between long and short axis motion in healthy individuals are characteristic, and their loss is an early index of systolic ventricular disease. These disturbances precede changes in orthodox measures such as fractional shortening or peak velocity of circumferential fibre shortening.

Objective—To investigate the effects of QRS duration on characteristics of the left ventricular pressure pulse derived from the time course of functional mitral regurgitation by continuous wave Doppler.Design—Retrospective and prospective study of 50 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, by electrocardiography, echocardiography, and Doppler cardiography.Setting—Tertiary cardiac referral centre.Patients—50 patients (mean age (SD) 58 (16)) with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with functional mitral regurgitation.Results—The values of QRS duration ranged widely, from 70 to 190 ms with a mean value of 110 ms, and were unimodally distributed. The overall duration of mitral regurgitation correlated positively with QRS time (r=0·65) over the entire range of values. When the duration of mitral regurgitation was divided into contraction, aortic ejection, and relaxation times, increased QRS duration prolonged contraction (r=0·51) and relaxation (r=0·52) times. Aortic ejection time was affected by RR interval (r=0·74). Duration of QRS correlated negatively with peak rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (+dP/dt) (r=−0·48), and positively with the time intervals from Q to peak pressure (r=0·49) and to peak +dP/dt (r=0·72), and also with those from the start of mitral regurgitation to peak pressure (r=0·49) and to peak +dP/dt (r=0·76). Duration of QRS did not directly affect the peak rate of left ventricular pressure fall (−dP/dt), or the isovolumic relaxation period.Conclusions—Values of QRS duration are unimodally distributed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, without evidence of a discrete group of patients with left bundle branch block. Prolonged QRS duration reduces peak +dP/dt, prolongs overall duration of the pressure pulse, the time to peak +dP/dt, and relaxation time. Duration of QRS must therefore be taken into account in assessing standard measurements of myocardial function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

A dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction is usually attributed to impaired systolic function. To investigate the possibility that ventricular filling might also be disturbed, M mode echocardiograms, phonocardiograms, and Doppler cardiograms were recorded in 30 patients with ventricular disease of varying cause. All but four had functional mitral regurgitation. The size of the left ventricular cavity was increased in all and peak velocity of circumferential fibre shortening was reduced. Diastolic abnormalities included a short isovolumic relaxation time, and, on digitised M mode, a reduced rate of dimension increase and of posterior wall thinning. Although the timing of aortic valve closure was normal, mitral regurgitation persisted beyond it by 95 (35) ms and beyond mitral valve opening by 60 (40) ms. This reduced the effective filling time (the interval when the mitral valve was open and mitral regurgitation was absent) to less than 200 ms in seven patients. The effective filling time correlated closely with the RR interval, the regression equation indicating a reduction of 80 ms for each 100 ms fall in RR interval. It was also independently shortened by 2 ms a year with increasing age. The effective left ventricular filling time may thus be very short in patients with left ventricular cavity dilatation and functional mitral regurgitation. It is suggested that when diastolic function is also abnormal, this short filling time may physically limit ventricular inflow. Its close relation to heart rate might contribute to the therapeutic effect of beta blockade in such patients.ImagesFig 1Fig 3	Impairment of diastolic function by shortened filling period in severe left ventricular disease.

"M mode and Doppler echocardiograms, apex cardiograms, and phonocardiograms were recorded in 50 patients with severe ventricular disease of varying aetiology to examine how left ventricular filling is disturbed by cavity dilatation. The size of the left ventricular cavity was increased in all with a mean (SD) transverse diameter of 7.2 (0.8) cm at end diastole and 6.3 (0.8) cm at end systole. All were in sinus rhythm and 35 had functional mitral regurgitation. In nine patients, in whom filling period was less than 170 ms, transmitral flow showed only a single peak, representing summation. In the remainder there was a strikingly bimodal distribution of filling pattern. In 12 the ventricle filled dominantly with atrial systole (A fillers). Isovolumic relaxation was long (75 (35) ms) and wall motion incoordinate; mitral regurgitation was present in only one. In most (29) the left ventricle filled predominantly during early diastole (E fillers). Mitral regurgitation, which was present in 26, was much more common than in the A fillers, while the isovolumic relaxation time (10 (24) ms) was much shorter and the normal phase relations between flow velocity and wall motion were lost. In 24 E fillers no atrial flow was detected. In four there was no evidence of any mechanical activity, suggesting ""atrial failure"". In 20, either the apex cardiogram or the mitral echogram showed an A wave, implying that atrial contraction had occurred but had failed to cause transmitral flow, showing that ventricular filling was fundamentally disturbed in late diastole. A series of discrete abnormalities of filling, beyond those shown by Doppler alone, could thus be detected in this apparently homogeneous patient group by a combination of non-invasive methods. The presence and nature of these abnormalities may shed light on underlying physiological disturbances.Images"	Relation of filling pattern to diastolic function in severe left ventricular disease.

"Mitral valve cusp separation on M mode echogram, the mitral valve opening artefact, and the onset of forward transmitral flow recorded by Doppler echocardiography have all been taken to mark the end of isovolumic relaxation, while its onset has been taken either as the aortic closure sound (A2) recorded phonocardiographically or the aortic closure artefact determined by Doppler technique. Possible differences in the measurement of the isovolumic relaxation time were studied when these landmarks were used in 44 healthy people, 14 patients with mitral stenosis, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by recording M mode echograms of the mitral valve, and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra of transmitral flow, with simultaneous electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms. A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However, when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation, the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals, by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation. These intervals cannot be used interchangeably to measure ""isovolumic relaxation time""."

The effect of mitral valve closure on left ventricular filling time and its relation to the onset of systole were assessed from mitral valve echocardiograms and simultaneous apex cardiograms in 21 normal subjects, 11 patients with left bundle branch block, and 19 patients with VDD pacemakers programmed for atrioventricular intervals of 50, 150, and 250 ms. The interval between the electrocardiograph Q wave and the apex cardiogram upstroke was similar in normal subjects and patients with left bundle branch block, but was significantly longer in patients with VDD pacemakers at all atrioventricular intervals. Similarly there was little difference in the time interval between the Q wave and mitral valve closure in normal individuals and patients with left bundle branch block but this was considerably delayed in VDD pacemaker patients with the atrioventricular interval set at 50 ms. With increasing atrioventricular intervals the mitral valve closed significantly earlier, whereas the onset of left ventricular systole and the timing of mitral valve opening remained unchanged. Thus as a result of earlier mitral valve closure left ventricular filling time decreased progressively as the atrioventricular interval was increased. Since the onset of left ventricular systole, with respect to left ventricular stimulation, is considerably delayed in VDD pacemaker patients a short atrioventricular interval is required in these patients to maintain the normal time relations between atrial and ventricular contraction and hence maximise left ventricular filling.ImagesFig. 4Fig. 5	Mitral valve closure and left ventricular filling time in patients with VDD pacemakers.

Sixty four consecutive patients with isolated mitral regurgitation referred for Doppler echocardiography were divided into three groups: group 1, 20 patients with severe mitral regurgitation that required operation; group 2, 22 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and secondary mitral regurgitation; and group 3, 22 patients with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation that did not require valve operation. M mode and continuous wave Doppler traces with a simultaneous electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram were analysed to identify time intervals that could be used to distinguish patients who needed valve operation from those who did not. An interval of less than 55 ms between the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2) and the cessation of mitral retrograde flow was a powerful predictor that the patient required operation (sensitivity 100% and specificity 86%). The mean (SD) value of this variable in group 1 (40(15) ms) was significantly lower than in group 2 (90(35)ms) and group 3 (75(20)ms). Mean isovolumic relaxation time was less than normal in group 1 but did not differ significantly between groups. Deceleration of regurgitant velocity at end ejection was greater in group 1. The pressure drop from the left ventricle to the left atrium at A2 of less than 50% of the peak gradient also identified patients who needed valve operation (sensitivity 75% and specificity 68%). These findings may help to identify patients who require operation. They suggest that there are significant differences in the dynamics of flow velocities in patients with mitral regurgitation, possibly related to the relative resistances to retrograde and anterograde and anterograde flow.ImagesFig 1Fig 2	Assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation from the dynamics of retrograde flow.

M-mode echocardiograms were performed in 31 normal children in order to compare myocardial wall dynamics in different regions of the left ventricle. Tracings were recorded at the level of the mitral valve ring (level 1), near the tips of the mitral valve leaflets (level 2), and in the region of the papillary muscles (level 3) and were digitised. Fractional shortening increased from 31.7 per cent at level 1 to 36.5 per cent at level 3. Peak VCF and minor dimension lengthening rate were the same at all three levels, as were end-diastolic posterior wall thickness and peak systolic wall thickening rate. Striking regional differences, however, were seen in the extent of systolic posterior wall thickening which increased from 55 per cent at the base to 106 per cent at the papillary muscles, and in peak posterior wall thinning rate, which increased from 6.4 cm/s at the base to 10.0 cm/s at the papillary muscles. There was greater systolic inward movement of epicardium at level 1 than at levels 2 and 3. The septum thinned and thickened more slowly than did the posterior wall and did not show major differences between levels. Systolic reduction in minor dimension thus occurs largely by thickening of the wall at level 3 and by sphincter-like inward movement of the entire wall at level 1. These regional differences can be explained by a circumferential arrangement of myocardial fibres at the base of the heart and a more prominent longitudinal component towards the apex. Thus, non-uniformity of function is a prominent feature of the normal left ventricle and may reflect regional variation in its structure.Images	Regional non-uniformity of wall dynamics in normal left ventricle.

In order to investigate the possibility of regional variation of ventricular structure, 25 normal postmortem human hearts were studied by inspection of cavity shape and subepicardial fibre orientation, by dissection, and by the histology of sections in two orthogonal planes. Ventricular architecture was complex. Inlet and outlet long axes were separated by 30 degrees in the left ventricle. In the right the corresponding figure was 90 degrees. The thickest part of the left ventricular wall was at the base. At the apex there was potential endo- and epicardial continuity. Left ventricular cavity shape departed significantly from any simple geometric figure, there being, consistently, regions of both positive and negative curvature on the diaphragmatic aspect. The presence of trabeculae caused considerable variation in wall thickness. Striking variation was found in the arrangement of subepicardial muscle fibres. Most pronounced was the contrast between the longitudinal arrangement of fibres observed on the oblique margin and the circumferential arrangement of those on the acute. On the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle, fibres near the crux and apex ran circumferentially while those between ran obliquely; those on the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle also ran circumferentially. Deeper in the myocardium the arrangement was simpler. In the mid-wall of the left ventricle fibres were circumferential, best developed towards the base and in the upper part of the septum. Near the apex of the left ventricle and in the mid-wall of the right ventricle such fibres were sparse. The subendocardial region consisted of longitudinally directed fibres forming the trabeculae and papillary muscles, while fibres deep to and between the trabeculae coursed more obliquely. These findings were confirmed by histology. Models based on uniform myocardial fibre structure cannot explain wall movement in normal subjects, and are likely to have significant limitations if used to investigated left ventricular function in disease.Images	Left ventricular fibre architecture in man.

"To investigate the effect of coronary artery bypass grafting on the timing of regional left ventricular wall motion, contrast left ventriculograms from 27 patients were digitised frame by frame before and after operation. End diastolic and end systolic volumes, ejection fraction, and peak ejection and filling rates showed no significant change. The commonest preoperative abnormality was delayed onset of inward wall motion during ejection, which was present in 14 patients over 10% (range 5-40%) of the cavity outline, leading to a pattern of ""diagonal contours"". After operation this pattern had resolved completely in 12 patients and partially in two. Minor abnormalities appeared postoperatively in five but overall the mean (1SD) area affected was reduced by 5 (8)%. The time span between the onset of inward motion in different regions of the cavity also fell significantly after surgery from 190 (50) to 130 (50) ms. Regional hypokinesis (6 cases) and abnormal wall motion during isovolumic contraction (4 cases) or isovolumic relaxation (5 cases) were not consistently affected. Thus successful coronary artery surgery is without consistent effect on overall left ventricular function, overall hypokinesis, or abnormal wall motion during the isovolumic periods. It does, however, strikingly reduce the asynchrony of wall motion during ejection, suggesting that before operation this abnormality may directly reflect impaired coronary blood flow. The results emphasise the potential value of analysing regional wall motion to elucidate functional abnormalities associated with coronary artery disease."

In order to investigate interrelations between early diastolic events, simultaneous apex-, phono-,f and echocardiograms were recorded in 10 normal and 55 patients with ischaemic heart disease. In normal subjects isovolumic relaxation time measured as A2 to mitral valve opening was 72 +/- 9 ms, the interval A2-0 point was 116 +/0 15 ms, and the amplitude of the f wave of the apexcardiogram relative to the total amplitude was 11 +/- 2%. In patients with a normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (less than 15 mmHg), isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged to 99 +/- 18 ms, A2-0 point to 162 +/- 5 ms, and the relative height of the f wave was increased to 21 +/- 4%. Isovolumic relaxation time and A2-0 point interval both showed significant inverse correlation with left ventricular diastolic pressure. Glyceryl trinitrate administration or isometric stress both caused well recognised changes in arterial pressure and cavity size. Neither had any additional effect during early diastole in normal subjects. In the patients, however, glyceryl trinitrate prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, delayed the 0 point of the apexcardiogram with respect to A2, increased the interval 0 point - f wave, and reduced the relative amplitude of the f wave. Isometric stress had the opposite effects. These changes extend beyond the end of ventricular relaxation and so are more readily explained on a mechanical basis, possibly as oscillations whose periodicity and degree of damping were increased by glyceryl trinitrate and decreased by isometric stress.

In order to determine the significance of abnormalities of diastolic function in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, exercise echocardiography to heart rates of 140 to 150 beats/min was performed in 18 normal subjects and 14 patients after aortic valve replacement. Simultaneous echo-, phono-, and electrocardiograms were recorded. Left ventricular cavity size was determined at end-diastole and end-systole. The timing of mitral valve opening and closure was measured, and hence left ventricular filling time derived, expressed either as ms/beat, or s/min when multiplied by heart rate. Isovolumic relaxation was taken as the interval between A2 and mitral valve opening. Systolic function, assessed from cavity dimensions, peak VCF, and QA2 interval was normal in all but two patients at rest and on exercise. Isovolumic relaxation was prolonged at rest in the patients to 85 +/- 8 ms (normal 69 +/- 9 ms), but left ventricular filling times were normal. With exercise, in normal subjects, isovolumic relaxation remained constant, but filling times dropped strikingly from 380 +/- 66 ms/beat, or 27 +/- 2 s/min at rest to 115 +/- 10 ms/beat or 16 +/- 2 s/min. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, isovolumic relaxation dropped on exercise to 41 +/- 15 ms. Filling periods were normal at rest, 367 +/- 67 ms/beat or 27 +/- 3 s/min, but failed to show the normal drop with exercise, being 240 +/- 44 ms/beat or 28 +/- 4 s/min. At heart rates above 120/min, separation between the two groups was complete. Thus, striking abnormalities of left ventricular filling can be demonstrated on exercise in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. They appear to represent loss of mechanisms whereby rapid diastolic filling is achieved in the normal subject.	Diastolic mechanisms of impaired exercise tolerance in aortic valve disease.

Twenty-eight patients with heart failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy, which had been diagnosed according to the criteria of Goodwin and Oakley, were treated with beta-blocking agents for six to 62 months, except for four patients who died within two months. Repeated non-invasive investigations were performed before and during treatment as well as exercise tests and chest x-rays. The echocardiographic and pulse curve findings indicated an improvement in systolic and diastolic myocardial function. The ejection fraction increased from 0.32 +/- 0.02 to 0.42 +/- 0.04, and the third heart sound amplitude and rapid filling wave were significantly reduced. The functional classification improved in 15 patients while in 12 patients it remained unchanged and in one it deteriorated. During follow-up, 10 patients died, most of them suddenly. The mortality was lower than expected in this severely ill group of patients. The beneficial effect of chronic beta-blockade in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy suggests that catecholamines are involved in the pathogenesis of congestive cardiomyopathy, and that patients with congestive cardiomyopathy may have inappropriate sympathetic cardiac stimulation which can be reduced by chronic beta-blockade. It is suggested that beta-receptor blockade should be added to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics in all patients with severe myocardial failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy.

"The relative sensitivities of and interrelations between different measurements of diastolic function were studied in 50 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed on anatomical grounds. Isovolumic relaxation time, the interval from minimum cavity dimension to mitral valve opening and relative dimension increase during this period, and the peak rate of dimension increase and wall thinning during rapid ventricular filling were measured by digitised M mode echocardiography. The relative heights of peak early diastolic and atrial velocities (a/E) and the time for decline of early diastolic velocity to half its peak value (velocity half time) were measured on continuous wave and pulsed Doppler and the relative height of the ""a"" wave was measured by apexcardiogram. All sets of values except those of the interval from minimum dimension to mitral opening were unimodally distributed, and all differed significantly from those in 20 age matched controls. The relative height of the ""a"" wave on the apexcardiogram (90% values were abnormal) was the most sensitive method of studying left ventricular diastolic function and peak rate of dimension increase was the least sensitive. Though none of the correlations was high, there were individual associations between peak rate of dimension increase, a/E, peak wall thinning rate, and velocity half time, and independently between delay in mitral valve opening and dimension change during this period. Other values seemed to be independent of one another, suggesting a different physiological basis. It is concluded that these various abnormal values do not reflect a single underlying disturbance of diastolic function. There are at least four possible discrete abnormalities: prolongation of isovolumic relaxation; incoordination during isovolumic relaxation; reduced rate of rapid filling; and an increase in the relative amplitude of the ""a"" wave probably caused by increased passive stiffness. These may be present singly or in combination in any patient.ImagesFig 1Fig 3"	Patterns of diastolic dysfunction in left ventricular hypertrophy.	L M Shapiro, D G Gibson	2967087	1988-04-01	11	
To identify mechanisms underlying slow left ventricular filling in coronary artery disease, left ventriculograms from 93 patients and 18 normal subjects were digitised frame by frame and global and regional function analysed. In 54 patients peak normalised filling rates were above the lower 95% confidence limit of normal (2 X 9s-1) and in 39 they were below. Patients with slow filling had a lower ejection fraction, a higher end systolic volume, and less overall shape index change, although a larger percentage occurred during isovolumic relaxation owing to asynchronous relaxation. Stroke volume was not significantly different. Slow outward wall motion was associated with increased cavity volume and systolic hypokinesis. Wall motion was also appreciably asynchronous, with wide spreads in the times of peak outward velocity and termination of rapid outward movement between regions. Early outward movement usually started in the anterior region, with peak velocity occurring before mitral valve opening, and significantly earlier than that in the apex or the inferior region. Ventricular oscillations occurred during filling in 23 patients. This asynchronous wall movement was unrelated to the distribution of coronary artery disease, systolic hypokinesis, or Q waves on electrocardiograms but was similar to that occurring in mitral stenosis. The main causes of slow left ventricular filling in patients with coronary artery disease appear to be (a) failure to achieve a normal low end systolic volume, with associated loss of physiological changes in left ventricular cavity shape, and (b) incoordinate wall motion during isovolumic relaxation which dissipates energy normally coupled to rapid ventricular filling. The resulting slow and asynchronous wall motion may have clinical implications especially when the time available for left ventricular filling is short.

To assess determinants of left ventricular filling time at rest simultaneous phonocardiograms, M mode echocardiograms, and indirect carotid pulse traces were performed on 50 patients with atrial fibrillation. Thus the effect of random variation in RR interval in the absence of atrial contraction on the inter-relation between systolic and diastolic events could be seen. Left ventricular filling time was closely related to RR interval and affected by it to a much greater extent than ejection time, so that filling time became very short when heart rate was fast. Two mechanisms were, however, identified whereby filling time was preserved: (a) prolongation of filling during the pre-ejection period of the following cycle, so that when the RR interval was less than 400 ms all of ventricular filling frequently occurred at this time; and (b) abbreviation of the QA2 interval of the succeeding beat with reduced filling, so that mitral valve opening occurred early. Changes in the duration of isovolumic contraction or relaxation time were not involved, neither could alteration in left ventricular contractile state resulting from variation in the interval between beats be shown to affect time at rest. The striking sensitivity of left ventricular filling time to rapid heart rate in atrial fibrillation suggests that it may be a major factor limiting cardiac performance. Diastolic as well as systolic events should, therefore, be taken into account when the effects of drugs or other physiological manoeuvres are studied in these patients.Images	Interaction between systolic and diastolic time intervals in atrial fibrillation.

Left ventriculograms of 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were digitised frame by frame and analysed using a contour display. Abnormalities of regional wall movement were present in 17, and included an abnormal sequence of inward movement during systole (13), regional delay in the onset of inward movement (10), and an abnormal dispersion of peak velocities (5). Diastolic wall movement was disturbed in 13, because of abnormal peak velocities in 7 and regional asynchrony in 6. Abnormal wall movement during the two isovolumic periods was rare in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, unlike ischaemic heart disease. These disturbances may reflect underlying structural abnormalities.

In order to assess the possible importance of regional non-uniformity of left ventricular function, angiograms of 42 normal subjects and 105 patients with coronary artery disease were digitised frame by frame. Regional curvature around the cavity was assessed, only positive curvature being compatible with ellipsoidal geometry. In normal subjects, positive curvature of the anterior wall was shown by all, but on the inferior wall was present in only 12 (28%) at end-diastole and five (12%) at end-systole. In patients with ischaemic heart disease, anterior wall curvature was again positive in all but four with apical aneurysm, but positive curvature of the inferior wall was present more frequently than normal, 47 (42%) at end-diastole and 39 (36%) at end-systole. In these patients, positive curvature at end-diastole was associated with reduced wall movement during ejection. Though the pattern of coronary artery involvement was random, there were conspicuous regional differences in the distribution of abnormal wall movement during isovolumic relaxation. Outward movement was found only on the anterior wall. Abnormal inward movement was five times as frequent on the inferior wall as on the anterior. An ellipsoidal cavity outline is not therefore characteristic of the normal left ventricle and, when present, this configuration is likely to be associated with a reduced amplitude of inferior wall movement. Regional differences of both structure and function can thus be shown in normal and abnormal hearts. They may arise from variation in local fibre architecture. Their presence must be taken into account in interpreting abnormalities of left ventricular function.	Regional non-uniformity of left ventricular wall movement in man.

OBJECTIVE--To assess the electrophysiological and antiarrhythmic effects of pharmacological load manipulation by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) and a direct vasodilator (hydralazine plus isosorbide mononitrate) in patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia and impaired left ventricular function. DESIGN--Randomised open label cross-over comparison of three regimens. SETTING--Tertiary arrhythmia referral centre. SUBJECTS--Eight patients with reduced left ventricular function and sustained ventricular tachycardia inducible by programmed stimulation. INTERVENTIONS--Three treatment regimens each of 48 hours duration: captopril, hydralazine plus isosorbide mononitrate, and control (no vasodilator). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in central haemodynamics, electrophysiological parameters, and induction of ventricular tachycardia during treatment with captopril, or hydralazine combined with nitrate, compared with a control period. RESULTS--Both vasodilator treatments produced similar balanced reductions in peak systolic pressures and filling pressures compared with controls. Captopril had no effect on sinus cycle length, atrial refractoriness, or intraventricular conduction, but prolonged ventricular effective and functional refractory periods and QT interval during constant rate atrial pacing. Hydralazine combined with nitrate did not significantly alter any electrophysiological variable. Ventricular tachycardia was similarly inducible during all three periods. CONCLUSIONS--Load manipulation by captopril but not hydralazine combined with nitrate prolonged ventricular refractoriness and repolarisation, possibly reflecting a combination of mechano-electrical effect with the restraining influence of ACE inhibitors on reflex sympathetic stimulation.

Right anterior oblique cineangiograms from 19 subjects without evidence of heart disease were analysed to assess regional non-uniformity in the time of onset of systolic inward motion, amplitude of systolic motion, time of peak inward motion, and wall motion during the isovolumic relaxation period. The left ventricular silhouette was digitised frame by frame for a full cardiac cycle. These four wall motion variables were quantitatively measured along 40 chords drawn from equally spaced points on the end diastolic silhouette to the nearest point on the end systolic silhouette. Onset of systolic inward motion was significantly non-uniform, being delayed by up to 120 ms in the anterior apical chords compared with the areas of earliest inward motion near the base of the heart. More uniformity was noted in time of peak inward motion; the differences between regions were not statistically significant. Amplitude of systolic motion was significantly less at the apical and mid-anterior segments than elsewhere in the heart. Wall motion during the isovolumic relaxation period is outward and greatest in the mid-anterior segments, but inward in the proximal inferior segments and mitral valve region. These data suggest that contraction of muscle fibres in the anterior apical segments is initially isometric due to the considerable afterload at the onset of contraction, this afterload being the result of earlier contraction elsewhere in the ventricle. This may partly explain the propensity for aneurysms to be located in the anterior apical region. When the timing and extent of wall motion in disease states are analysed, account must be taken of the non-uniformity in the normal heart.

1. The load bearing capacity during relaxation of ventricular cardiac muscle from various animal species was investigated. 2. The effect of load on the time course of relaxation was analysed either by comparing afterloaded contractions against various loads or by imposing abrupt alterations in load (load clamps). 3. In heart muscle from the mammalian species studied relaxation was sensitive to loading conditions, whereas in frog heart muscle relaxation was largely independent of the loading conditions. The mechanical properties of relaxation of cardiac muscle appear, therefore, governed by the interplay of a load-controlled and an activation-controlled decay mechanism, the relative importance of which differs with species. 4. Load-dependence may be the mechanical expression of the ratio of the number of force generating sites at any time during contraction and relaxation to the load to be carried; this mechanism would predominate in mammalian animal species with a well developed calcium sequestering sarcoplasmic reticulum. Activation-dependence would seem to predominate in animal species, such as frog, in which calcium sequestration appears to be the rate limiting step during relaxation.

Fifteen patients with congestive cardiomyopathy who had improved conspicuously on chronic administration of a beta-blocker were studied after withdrawal of the drug. In six patients there was a pronounced deterioration of their clinical condition, and in all of the remaining patients there was a significant decrease in ejection fraction, and signs of compromised diastolic function with pathological apex curves and an increase in third heart sound. All these changes were reversed within a few weeks to a few months after readministration of beta-blocking drugs. This study supports the idea that an aetiological factor in congestive cardiomyopathy may be a pathological response to sympathetic stimulation which could be partly controlled by administration of beta-blocking drugs.Images	Adverse effects of beta-blockade withdrawal in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy.

Adrenergic beta-blocking agents were given to 7 patients with advanced congestive cardiomyopathy who had tachycardia at rest (98 plus or minus 13 beats/min). The patients were on beta-adrenergic receptor blockade for 2 to 12 months (average 5-4 months). One patient was given alprenolol 50 mg twice daily and the other patients were given practolol 50 to 400 mg twice daily. Virus infection had occurred in 6 of the patients before the onset of symptoms of cardiac disease. All patients were in a steady state or were progressively deteriorating at the start of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics was unaltered or reduced during treatment with beta-blocking agents. An improvement was seen in their clinical condition shortly after administration of the drugs. Continued treatment resulted in an increase in physical working capacity and a reduction of heart size. Noninvasive investigations including phonocardiogram, carotid pulse curve, apex cardiogram, and echocardiogram showed improved ventricular function in all cases. The present study indicates that adrenergic beta-blocking agents can improve heart function in at lease some patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, it is suggested that increased catecholamine activity may be an important factor for the development of this disease, as has been shown in animal experiments.Images	Effect of chronic beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in congestive cardiomyopathy.

In order to determine the relation between three manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy--ST-T wave changes on the electrocardiogram, diastolic disturbances, and increased myocardial echo intensity--M mode and cross sectional echocardiograms were recorded in 12 normal subjects, 15 athletes, 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 42 patients with secondary left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis (20), severe essential hypertension (8), coarctation (7), or subaortic stenosis (7). M mode echocardiograms were digitised and cross sectional echocardiograms were analysed for regional echo intensity. In patients with hypertrophy regional echo amplitude was significantly increased in mid and basal septum and posterior left ventricular wall. Patients with increased echo amplitude in any region showed a higher incidence of ST-T wave abnormalities than those without and of diastolic abnormalities--including prolongation of isovolumic relaxation time, delay in mitral valve opening with respect to minimum cavity dimension, and a reduction in peak rate of posterior wall thinning and dimension increase. There was a significant rank order correlation between median pixel count and these diastolic abnormalities. No significant differences were demonstrable in these relations between the diagnostic groups. By contrast, electrocardiographic findings, diastolic function, and pixel count were uniformly normal in athletes, although the increase in left ventricular mass was similar to that in the patients. Thus an increase in left ventricular mass alone is not responsible for repolarisation or wall motion abnormalities occurring in pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. These latter changes are, however, strongly associated with the change in myocardial properties detected as an increase in echo intensity and may be due to increased interstitial fibrosis.Images	Relation of regional echo amplitude to left ventricular function and the electrocardiogram in left ventricular hypertrophy.

In order to study left ventricular filling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular cineangiograms of 20 patients were digitised frame by frame and compared with those of 10 normal subjects. Peak left ventricular filling rate was 770+/-260 ml s-1 (mean+/-1 standard deviation), not significantly different from normal. Mitral valve opening was delayed, occurring 140+/-40 ms after time of minimum cavity area, compared with 93+/-14 msec in normals (P less than 0-01), indicating abnormal relaxation. Peak left ventricular filling rate was correlated inversely with this delay (r = 0-69, P less than 0-01), which was greater in patients with angina (155+/-27 ms) than in those without (85+/-23 ms) (P less than 0-01). The rapid filling period was also abnormally prolonged in 8 patients. End-diastolic transverse dimension was normal (5-3+/-0-7 cm) but end-systolic dimension was reduced (2-4+/-0-4 cm) (P less than 0-01) because of abnormal cavity shape. Peak rate of change of dimension during filling (18-7+/-5-3 cm s-1) was greater than normal (11-3+/-3-9 cm s-1) (P less than 0-01), and correlated with peak filling rate (r = 0-82, P less than 0-001). Thus, peak filling rate is normal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but the filling pattern may be abnormal, apparently because of impaired relaxation and abnormal cavity shape rather than mechanical obstruction to inflow.

Echocardiograms showing left ventricular cavity and mitral valve cusps simultaneously were recorded in 36 patients, apex cardiograms being obtained in 26 of them. These were digitised and continuous plots made of left ventricular dimension, its rate of change, and anterior mitral leaflet velocity, and were compared with those in 20 normal subjects. Peak mitral diastolic closure rate was reduced to 120 +/- 80 mm/s, compared with normal (250 +/- 60 mm/s). Peak rate of increase of dimension was normal (13.4 cm/s), though the pattern of filling was disturbed, with the duration of rapid filling prolonged in 5, and shortened in 15, suggesting restriction. Mitral valve opening, normally synchronous with minimum dimension, was delayed by a mean of 76 ms, and during this period there was an abnormal increase in dimension. Dimension also increased by 50 +/- 25 per cent of the total diastolic excursion before the 'O' point of the apex cardiogram compared with 21 +/- 7 per cent in normals, and the timing of peak rate of increase of dimension was delayed by 50 +/- 20 ms instead of being synchronous with the 'O' point as normal. None of these findings correlated with the reduction in peak mitral diastolic closure rate. Noninvasive methods thus show that relaxation may be abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Delay in mitral valve opening and disturbances in the rate, duration, and co-ordination of wall movement during filling suggest the presence of segmental abnormalities of left ventricular function.Images	Left ventricular relaxation and filling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1. The effect of load manipulation on myocardial excitability was studied in the anaesthetized, in situ pig heart. 2. A 33% increase in systolic left ventricular pressure achieved by aortic clamping reduced the mean effective refractory period by 11 ms (7.6%, P less than 0.01); whereas a 15% reduction in ventricular pressure achieved by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside increased the mean effective refractory period by 4 ms (3.2%, P less than 0.05). 3. Changes in action potential duration, measured to 70% repolarization, roughly paralleled those of the effective refractory period. 4. The changes in effective refractory period were inhomogeneous, with a greater change occurring at the apex compared to the base in response to an increase in load, i.e. there was an increase in regional dispersion of refractoriness across the left ventricle. 5. Since inhomogeneity of repolarization and refractoriness is known to be potentially arrhythmogenic, these findings suggest that mechanical factors may contribute directly to the arrhythmias commonly seen clinically in high load states such as congestive cardiac failure and may also have consequences for the treatment of such arrhythmias.

To determine the effect of myocardial shortening velocity on the duration of electrical and mechanical systole, five healthy men, ages 32 to 41, were studied. Carotid message and atropine were used to define the effects of changes in heart rate without changes in shortening rate. The effects of amyl nitrite, which produced approximately the same degree of tachycardia as atropine but a significantly higher maximum shortening rate, were compared with those of atropine to assess the effects of faster shortening velocities. The increased heart rate produced by both agents caused a substantial decrease in both the QT and the S1S2 intervals, but the QT interval was longer and the S1S2 interval shorter with the amyl nitrite. Thus, the S2T interval was substantially longer after amyl nitrite. The results are in keeping with the finding in isolated cardiac muscle that active shortening increases action potential duration and decreases the duration of mechanical activation. These observations raise the possibility that longer QT intervals and shorter S1S2 intervals would also be seen in patients with hypokinetic ventricular segments when the healthy muscle contracts more vigorously to compensate for the weaker segments.Images	Effect of myocardial shortening velocity on duration of electrical and mechanical systole.

The effect of early chronic Chagas's disease on the timing and extent of regional left ventricular wall motion was studied with a frame by frame analysis of left ventriculograms in nine patients and compared with those in 19 normal subjects. In all the patients there was hypokinesis or akinesis in the anteroapical region together with delay in the onset of inward movement. Hypokinesis of the proximal inferior segment was also present, but the time of onset of inward motion here was normal. These differences can be explained on the basis of regional asynchrony within the normal left ventricle, where anteroapical wall motion is delayed with respect to that elsewhere. Thus contraction of the diseased anteroapical segment starts against an appreciable pressure and so may be isometric, whereas the affected proximal inferior segment starts contracting earlier against a lower pressure and so is able to shorten. No abnormalities of wall motion were seen during isovolumic relaxation despite segmental involvement, which is a distinctly different finding from that in patients with coronary artery disease. This may be due partly to the absence of incoordinate relaxation in Chagas's disease and partly to myocardial involvement by Chagas's disease in the mid-anterior segment. This is the site of rapid early diastolic wall thinning, which has been put forward as a major mechanism of normal rapid ventricular filling and whose premature activity causes disturbances in regional wall motion before mitral valve opening when relaxation is incoordinate. Thus quantitative analysis of both the timing and amplitude of wall motion indicates fundamental differences between Chagas's disease and coronary artery disease, when a less complex analysis would have shown a similar pattern of segmental dysfunction in both. Since the effect of the same pathological process on wall motion varies with the site of ventricular involvement, the importance of the disturbances seen in Chagas's disease becomes apparent only when the non-uniformity of normal left ventricular structure and function is taken into account.Images	Left ventricular wall motion in patients with Chagas's disease.

1. The influence of load and activation on relaxation of heart muscle has been studied. 2. Cardiac cells devoid of functioning sarcolemma were isolated from rat and cat ventricular myocardium. Pretreatment with the detergent Brij-58 destroyed residual sarcoplasmic reticulum function. In order to analyse the mechanical properties of relaxation in these cells, a new miniature transducer was designed which could measure force by feedback sensing (resolution of 1 microgram). Contraction was induced by ionophoretically released calcium ions. Activation, sequestration of calcium and loading conditions could be controlled independently. 3. The time course of relaxation was shown to be governed by the amount of calcium released, and unlike intact preparations from rat or cat heart (but like those from frog), to be independent of load and of alterations in load. 4. We conclude that relaxation of the cardiac contractile system is determined basically by an activation-dependent mechanism, which is masked by load dependence in intact muscle preparations with a well developed calcium sequestering membraneous system.

1. The effect of catecholamines on the time course and amplitude of contraction and on KCl-induced contractures has been studied in mammalian hearts.2. Marked and reproducible contractures could be obtained in mammalian ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles after β-adrenergic block with propanolol or if the hearts were depleted of their catecholamine stores by reserpine or by chemical denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine.3. In neonatal hearts with lower endogenous catecholamine stores and poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum KCl contractures are easily produced.4. Catecholamines potentiate twitch tension and relax the contracture tension under all of the above circumstances.5. The relaxant effect of catecholamines is present during the time course of a twitch. This increased relaxation rate as well as the shortening of the time-to-peak of tension is independent of the variation in the duration of the action potential.6. The shortened relaxation time is present when the action potential is shortened with anodal repolarization or prolonged with cathodal depolarization (voltage-clamp).7. The relaxant effect of catecholamines on the twitch is temperature and rate dependent. The effect is observed in the presence of high or low concentrations of calcium.8. The presence of catecholamines is necessary for full relaxation of mammalian heart muscle under high performance conditions or states of calcium overload.9. It is proposed that catecholamines exert their relaxant effect independent of their positive inotropic effect by stimulating the sequestering system (sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria or sarcolemma) for calcium.ImagesFig. 4Fig. 5Fig. 6	Relaxing effects of catecholamines on mammalian heart	M.

1. A study has been made of the effect of temperature on the resting tension and on the form of the isometric twitch of isolated rat skeletal muscle. The soleus and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were used as representatives of slow and fast types of muscle. The main interest is in the behaviour at low temperature, when rat muscle shows characteristics which are not found with frog muscle.2. At higher temperatures both soleus and EDL of the rat resemble frog muscle in showing a `rubber-like' form of resting tension, i.e. the tension increases with warming: this has not previously been demonstrated in mammalian muscle. But at low temperatures (below 15° C) the converse is observed; tension then increases as temperature falls. This `cold tension' is much larger with soleus than with EDL. The `cold tension' is the converse of the `rubber-like' tension also in its dependence on length; it becomes smaller when the muscle is stretched.3. These muscles remain excitable and give consistent twitches with transverse stimulation at temperatures down to about 3° C provided the exposure to cold is not prolonged beyond a few minutes. The amplitude of the twitch is reduced by cooling, e.g. at 3° C it is about 30-50% of that at 25° C.4. The twitch becomes very prolonged at low temperatures. With a soleus at 3-4° C it may last 40 sec. The temperature coefficient of the rate constant of the relaxation phase is very high compared with that of frog's muscle.5. The rate constant of relaxation in a twitch at low temperature increases when the muscle is stretched. This is the reverse of what happens at higher temperature.6. The extreme prolongation of the twitch with cooling indicates a very large decrease in the rate of decay of the active state, and it is suggested that the increase of resting tension at low temperature is due to an accumulation of `activator'.

1. The tension generated by isolated frog atrial trabecules, during exposure to solutions containing a high potassium concentration, is not maintained but spontaneously relaxes. The final part of this relaxation can be fitted by a single exponential function.2. The recovery of the tension generating mechanisms following the spontaneous relaxation of a potassium contracture depends on the preceding membrane potential and the time since the last contracture.3. The rate of the exponential phase of the spontaneous relaxation is independent of the [K]o and hence the membrane potential, the [Ca]o; and when the [Ca]o/[Na]o2 ratio is maintained it is also independent of the [Na]o. This relaxation is not influenced by atropine or pronethalol.4. When sodium is totally excluded from the bathing medium the rate of relaxation of a later potassium contracture is much increased. It is argued that this change is due to a fall in the intracellular sodium concentration.5. The consequences of these results are discussed, and the hypothesis that is favoured would require that contraction is induced by a transient release of calcium into the sarcoplasm, probably triggered by a potential dependent, and probably also transient, influx of calcium through the cell membrane. Relaxation is supposed to occur when this activator-calcium is then removed by an intracellular relaxing system that resembles the sarcoplasmic reticulum of other muscles. What this intracellular structure might be, is also discussed.

We report our experiences with nine women suffering from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who between them had 13 pregnancies, 10 of which were directly managed by us. Though at first we felt that the theoretical hazards of vaginal delivery indicated elective caesarean section, experience has convinced us that in the absence of an obstetrical contraindication these patients may be delivered vaginally provided a betaadrenergic blocking drug is administered during pregnancy and especially during labour, ergometrine is given at the end of the second stage, adequate supplies of cross-matched blood are available, and prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is administered. We have found no evidence of any adverse effects of either propranolol or pronethalol on the foetus.	Management of Pregnancy Complicated by Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy*	Gillian M.

Echocardiography of the mitral valve in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy has revealed an abnormal pattern of movement. The abnormality is characteristic, readily recognized, and can be explained in anatomical and physiological terms. It consists of a sharp reopening of the valve during systole when it should normally remain in the fully closed position. This abnormal movement mirrors the mid-systolic onset of both outflow tract obstruction and mitral regurgitation. It was only absent in the two patients with the disease in whom both mitral regurgitation and outflow tract obstruction were also absent. A second and less striking abnormality was a reduced diastolic closure similar to that seen in mitral stenosis and attributed to slow left ventricular filling. The echo from the septum is also unduly prominent.	Mechanism of mitral regurgitation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy*	R. B. Pridie, C. M. Oakley	5462283	1970-03-01	11

To study the cardiac effects of running, 15 healthy non-athletic male volunteers underwent a moderate training schedule for six weeks; thereafter five continued to run at a similar intensity for a further six weeks and 10 stopped. Left ventricular wall thickness and dimension, relaxation, and diastolic function were studied by digitised echocardiography at entry and at two, four, and six weeks, and again at 12 weeks. Significant increases in running ability and maximum oxygen consumption were observed. Maximum oxygen consumption was unchanged in those who continued to run but a reduction was noted in those who stopped. No significant changes in left ventricular dimensions were observed, but the thickness of the posterior wall and the septum increased during six weeks' running. Left ventricular mass (cube volume formula) increased significantly during the first six weeks. Comparison of those who continued to train and those who stopped showed that the former had no change in mass, whereas in the latter mass returned towards pre-exercise values. Systolic function (fractional shortening) was unchanged throughout the study. In addition, no abnormalities of relaxation or diastolic function were detected. Exercise induced left ventricular hypertrophy may develop rapidly during training and the increased myocardial mass resulting from six or 12 weeks' running is not associated with impaired relaxation and diastolic function as found in pathological forms of hypertrophy.Images	Effect of training on left ventricular structure and function.

Cross sectional echocardiograms were recorded within one week of death in seven patients with valvular heart disease, four with coronary artery disease, and nine with congenital heart disease. Regional echo amplitude was measured from the cross sectional display by constructing histograms of pixel intensity. Parietal pericardium was used as an internal standard for setting the gain of the instrument. At necropsy myocardium was taken from the free wall of the left ventricle, the papillary muscles, and the septum. Fibrosis was assessed histologically and biochemically as hydroxyproline content. In individual samples histological and biochemical estimates were correlated. In all regions other than the septum in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, log [collagen] correlated with median pixel intensity. The amplitude of reflected echoes from the hypertrophied septum was significantly higher than that from other samples but was similarly correlated with collagen content. Agreement between echo amplitude and histological grade was significantly less good. Thus in chronic left ventricular disease myocardial collagen content appears to be the major determinant of regional echo intensity. Reproducibility of measurements and more rigorous definition of tissue abnormalities will, however, require further study.Images	Relation between regional echo intensity and myocardial connective tissue in chronic left ventricular disease.

Echocardiographic patterns in 15 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were compared with those in 30 healthy persons. Correlations with angiocardiographic data indicated that most of the anatomical abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be assessed reliably by echocardiography. These include abnormal mitral valve motion, a reduction of the anteroposterior dimension of the left ventricular outflow tract and of the left and right ventricular cavities, increased thickness of the interventricular septum and the posterior left ventricular wall. Comparision of the haemodynamic and echocardiographic data showed that some degree of abnormal mitral valve motion during systole may occur in the absence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. On the other hand, it need not always be present with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Other, hitherto unrecognized, abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detected by this technique were: (1) Aortic valve regurgitation in three out of nine patients with evidence of left ventricular cutflow tract obstruction at cardiac catheterization. (2) Left ventricular inflow tract obstruction at the mitral valve level associated with gross septal hypertrophy (five cases). (3) Abnormal forward displacement of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and of the chordae tendineae during systole in 10 patients, in seven of whom there was confirmatory angiocardiographic evidence. Seven patients with miscellaneous cardiac disorders are described in whom asymmetric septal hypertrophy was revealed by echocardiography. In one of these patients coexisting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was excluded histologically; thus asymmetrical septal hypertrophy is not confined to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Images	Echocardiographic spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1. Exposure of the body from iliac crests to feet of a horizontal subject to a pressure 70 mm Hg below atmospheric causes a displacement of about 10 g of blood/kg total body weight from the upper to the lower part of the body. Much of this blood is returned very rapidly at the end of suction.2. During suction, the changes in the circulation resemble those during a foot-down tilt. After suction, the changes resemble to some extent those following the Valsalva manoeuvre.3. The overshoot of forearm blood flow following suction is caused by variations in the activity of adrenergic vasoconstrictor nerves. The receptors for this reflex have not been identified, but their stimulation depends upon a rapid and large return of blood to the central circulation.

1. The interrelation of thermoregulatory and baroreceptor reflexes in the control of the circulation through the forearm has been investigated in eight men.2. The results are compatible with the current hypotheses that thermoregulatory reflexes employ exclusively blood vessels in the skin, and that baroreceptor vasodilator reflexes excited by transfer of blood from the legs to the trunk employ exclusively blood vessels in the muscles. They are compatible with the hypothesis that baroreceptor vasoconstrictor reflexes excited by transfer of blood from the trunk to the legs employ blood vessels in muscles, but not with the hypothesis that they do so exclusively.3. The results indicate that when blood is transferred from the trunk to the legs, vasoconstriction over-rides thermoregulatory vasodilatation, presumably in the blood vessels of the skin.4. The circulation through the skin appears, therefore, to be under baroreceptor as well as thermoregulatory reflex control, and over the short period of time examined, namely 1 min, the baroreceptor control takes precedence.

In sheep and calf ventricular bundles, increasing the internal calcium by increasing the frequency of voltage-clamping to plateau range potentials increased the time-independent outward current. This effect was more marked with higher [Ca]o, and was reduced if the Ca current blockers Verapamil or D 600 were used. 2. If the internal Ca was increased by the addition of cyanide and reduction of external sodium the outward current was also increased. The frequency-dependent increase in outward current also occurred in this Na-poor (12 mM) solution. 3. Tension measurement on the ventricular bundles showed that a Na-free solution with cyanide did not cause a contracture. On changing from Tyrode to a Na-free solution containing cyanide, and on changing back to Tyrode there was a potentiation of the twitch. 4. In Na-poor solution with cyanide, although no contracture was found, ECa was less positive, suggesting that under these circumstances Ca accumulates at the inner side of the membrane, but not around the myofibrils. 5. The prolongation of the action potential in Cl-free solution is frequency-dependent. A greater prolongation is seen at lower frequencies suggesting that Cl current is relatively more important for repolarization at lower frequencies of stimulation. 6. It is suggested that calcium at the inner side of the membrane sets the level of the background outward current. A feed-back mechanism on this basis is proposed for the control of the action potential duration. Various factors that could influence this basic mechanism are discussed.

1. Membrane potential, tension and membrane current were simultaneously recorded from frog ventricular strips in a modified sucrose-gap which enabled control of membrane potential by voltage clamp.2. Shortening the frog ventricular action potential by repolarizing the membrane to the resting potential terminates contraction.3. Depolarization to the level of the normal action potential plateau for longer than about 80-100 msec (up to 30 sec) produces and maintains tension for the duration of the depolarization.4. Depolarizations less than about 80 msec in duration generate no tension but can facilitate the tension response to subsequent depolarizations. The facilitating effect of a short depolarizing pulse persists for no longer than 0·5 sec.5. The mechanical threshold is about -50 mV; the relation between membrane potential and tension is fairly linear from about +5 to +80 mV.6. Variation of holding potential, below the mechanical threshold, has no effect on the tension—voltage relation. The absolute membrane potential rather than pulse amplitude determines the developed tension.7. Increasing external calcium increases the slope of the voltage—tension relation.8. Contraction of the frog ventricle is directly controlled by the electrical activity of the surface membrane.	Excitation—contraction coupling in frog ventricle: evidence from voltage clamp studies	M.

1. It has long been known that a resting muscle shows a reversible `rubber-like' response to a change of temperature: it develops tension when warmed and this reverses on cooling. It was recently shown (Hill, 1968) that part of the resting tension is due to a weak interaction between the sliding filaments, and it was suggested that the rubber-like tension might be caused by the same process rather than by some inert structural component. Further information on this point has now been obtained from some observations on the effect of temperature on isometric tension at temperatures not far below the level (28-35° C) at which a heat contracture is produced.2. The temperature of a frog's sartorius was changed by moving it up and down in a vessel containing Ringer solution at two different temperatures. The temperature in one part was maintained constant in the range 0-20° C and in the other at 5-35° C. The changes was 90% complete in 12 sec.3. From 0° up to about 23° C the tension developed per 1° C rise of temperature (ΔP/ΔT) is almost constant, but as the temperature approaches the level at which a heat contracture appears the value of ΔP/ΔT rises steeply. This behaviour indicates that the tension in question has an `active' rather than a `passive' origin, and this view is supported by other evidence from experiments with muscles in hypertonic solutions, described in the next paper.4. It was found that the temperature at which a muscle goes into a heat contracture depends on the length at which it is set; the critical temperature is lower in an extended muscle. A shortened muscle at a temperature not far below the critical value will therefore produce a contracture when it is stretched.

1. It has long been known that the tension of a resting muscle rises when it is warmed and falls on cooling. It is shown here that treatment with hypertonic solution causes an alteration in this effect; the usual rise or fall of tension with warming or cooling is then preceded by a transient change in the opposite direction.2. The magnitude of the abnormal reversed phase does not depend in a simple, linear, manner on the temperature change. For instance, the effect for cooling from 20 to 0° C is much greater than twice that for 10 to 0° C.3. The results lead to the suggestion that the tension, in both normal and hypertonic muscle, comes from an active process. It is proposed that a temperature change operates by altering the concentration of an `activating substance', and that the change of concentration becomes delayed by hypertonicity.

1. The time course of build-up or decline of twitch tension in response to enhancement or reduction of the external calcium concentration was determined in frog heart ventricles, in the hypodynamic state as well as under non-hypodynamic conditions.2. The tension build-up induced by high calcium was greatly slowed when the heart passed into the hypodynamic state, whereas the decline in low calcium was little altered by this condition.3. The tension decline consisted of two approximately exponential phases, an initial rapid phase (t½ between 3 and 10 sec) and a later slow phase (t½ between 50 and 180 sec).4. A similar composite time course of tension build-up only occurred under certain conditions: (a) in ventricles in which the hypodynamic state had not developed; (b) after a conditioning period of exposure to enhanced calcium or reduced sodium concentrations.5. The results are explained on the assumption that contraction is brought about by the co-operative action inside heart cells of two calcium compounds whose concentrations change at different rates after variation of the external calcium concentration.6. Formal relationships describing the dependence of twitch tension on the concentration of these two hypothetical compounds are obtained.A tentative explanation of the development of the hypodynamic state is also proposed.

1. The changes in twitch tension during the ascending and descending staircase of the frog heart have been examined under various experimental conditions including the hypodynamic and prehypodynamic state.2. The descending staircase resembles the tension change after reduction of external calcium concentration in showing two consecutive phases, an initial rapid and later slow phase of tension decline.3. The time course of the ascending staircase depends on the condition of the heart; it is slow after, and rapid before, development of the hypodynamic state. It is also rapid when elicited after conditioning periods of increased heart rate.4. The tension transients in response to brief concentration steps of external calcium concentration were examined at various levels of heart rate. The results indicate that at high heart rates the sensitivity of heart cells to external calcium is increased.5. The results are interpreted along the lines of a previous hypothesis relating tension development to the cooperative action of two intracellular calcium compounds. The additional assumption is made that an intermediary exists which facilitates calcium movements in heart cells to an extent depending on the level of heart rate.

1. A slow inward current in ventricular preparations of the dog heart can be measured by the voltage clamp method without interference from the initial rapid sodium current if the sodium system is inactivated by conditioning depolarization.2. The slow inward current is very sensitive to variation in [Ca]o. It occurs above the equilibrium potential of INa immediately after changing the bathing fluid to a sodium-free solution and persists under this condition for a long time without much alteration, while INa is rapidly abolished. Tetrodotoxin and [Mg]o have no effect on this current component. These results strongly support the view that the slow inward current in cardiac tissue is carried by calcium ions.3. The threshold for initiation of the calcium current is around -35 mV in Tyrode solution and is shifted to more negative potentials by either increasing [Ca]o or reducing [Na]o.4. Calcium sensitive inward current tails associated with repolarization are assumed to represent a proportional measure of calcium conductance activated during the preceding depolarization. Calcium conductance declines rapidly with time in the inside negative potential range and slowly at positive potentials. The time constants for this `inactivation' process vary between 40 and 700 msec in the potential range -35 to +50 mV.5. By using instantaneous current—voltage relations the reversal potential of calcium current was estimated to be about +60 mV in normal Tyrode solution. As shown in the Appendix, however, the calcium equilibrium potential cannot be considered to be constant.6. The importance of the calcium current for the plateau of the cardiac action potential is discussed.	Membrane calcium current in ventricular myocardial fibres	G. W. Beeler, H. Reuter	5503869	1970-03-01	11	
1. Membrane currents and contractile responses have been measured in ventricular myocardial preparations under voltage clamp conditions.2. In Tyrode solution, steady-state contraction was obtained only after 5-8 depolarizations to a given potential level. The threshold of steady-state tension was identical to the potential where the calcium inward current, ICa, was activated (about -35 mV). Both thresholds were shifted in the same direction along the voltage axis and by the same amount by changing [Ca]o or [Na]o. Maximum tension was obtained at inside positive potentials.3. The time courses of steady-state tension and of activation of ICa were different by more than one order of magnitude in Tyrode solution. But in order to achieve any appreciable steady-state tension, ICa had to flow during several identical depolarizations. Tension decreased again at potentials above ECa. This suggests that calcium inward current must flow in order to fill intracellular calcium stores from which calcium can be released by an unknown mechanism.4. The ability of a fibre bundle to contract again after a preceding twitch is greatly dependent on the membrane potential between two equal depolarizations. In Tyrode solutions with 1·8 and 7·2 mM-CaCl2 half restoration of this ability occurred at -45 ± 3 mV (± S.E. of mean) and -23 ± 4 mV, respectively.5. In sodium-free bathing solutions, steady-state tension was attained upon the first depolarization provided ICa was activated. Furthermore, at different potentials, the time courses of activation of tension and of activation of ICa were identical, i.e. tension reached its maximum when ICa was fully activated. This suggests that in sodium-free solutions the flow of calcium ions into the fibre directly activates contraction.

1. A method is described by which the solutions bathing single auricular trabeculae, isolated from the heart of the frog, can be rapidly altered while the tension generated and the membrane potential can be measured simultaneously.2. Changes of the [Ca]o result in changes of the twitch strength similar to that reported for frog ventricle.3. At [Ca]o of less than 1 mM, the isometric contracture tension generated during application of K-rich solutions, and the maximum rate of tension development, are proportional to [Ca]o3.4. This relationship is not the consequence of (a) the hypertonicity of the K-rich solutions, (b) the dependence of the membrane potential on [Ca]o, or (c) the facilitation due to a twitch response at the initiation of the contracture.5. Reduction of the [Na]o increases the strength of the high-K contractures according to the ratio of [Ca]o/[Na]o2; Na ions in the bathing medium are shown to competitively inhibit the potentiating action of Ca ions on the force generated during contractures.6. An equation is derived which assumes that three Ca compounds act co-operatively at some stage in the process of excitation—contraction coupling.7. Two hypotheses are discussed. The first proposes that the sarcoplasmic [Ca] established during depolarization of the muscle membrane depends upon [Ca]o3, and tension generated by the contractile elements on a first order reaction with ionic Ca. The second suggests that if the sarcoplasm [Ca] established during excitation is proportional to [Ca]o, then three Ca ions are required to activate the contractile response at the unit level.

Contractures develop in sheep atrial trabeculae if Tyrode's solution is rapidly replaced by a solution containing elevated potassium, reduced sodium, or both. Two phases of the contracture can be identified on the basis of differences in physiological behavior: a rapid and transient phase that predominates during the first few seconds of the contracture, and a slowly developed phase that is responsible for the steady level of tension reached later in the contracture. The transient phase is particularly prominent if the muscle is stimulated rapidly before the contracture, and reduced or absent if the muscle is not stimulated or if calcium is not present before the contracture. Recovery of the transient phase after a contracture parallels the recovery of twitches. This transient phase appears to reflect the depolarization-induced release of activator (calcium) from an internal store, possibly the same store that is involved in the normal contraction. The slowly developed tension is dependent on the contracture solution used, and is decreased if the calcium concentration is reduced or if the sodium concentration is increased. It does not depend on conditions before the contracture and does not require time to recover. This phase of the contracture may be due to entry of calcium from the extracellular solution.

1. The contractile strength generated by isolated frog auricular trabeculae has been determined by perfusion with high-K Ringer over a range of [Ca]o.2. Experiments are described in which the cubic relationship between the contracture tension and [Ca]o has been changed to a square or a linear relationship.3. These results have been interpreted by proposing that three Ca compounds, whose concentrations are proportional to [Ca]o, act co-operatively at some stage of the process leading to the generation of tension.4. The change in contractile strength, determined by regular electrically evoked twitches, has been investigated at different temperatures and the results have been explained by assuming that the concentrations of the three hypothetical activating compounds vary at different rates when [Ca]o is altered.5. The staircase response is supposed to develop as the consequence of an increase in the concentrations of the two activating Ca compounds with the slowest time constants.6. The possible physical representations of the hypothetical activating compounds are discussed.

1. The spontaneous relaxation of the potassium contracture and the relaxation induced by the removal of extracellular calcium or the restoration of the original potassium concentration, in the frog heart, show a strong dependence on temperature.2. The energy of activation of the later exponential phase of the spontaneous relaxation is 10·43 kcal mole-1, a value close to that reported for the binding of calcium ions by isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum, but larger than that for the calcium efflux from mammalian heart.3. The use of metabolic inhibitors shows that relaxation can be sustained when glycolysis is poisoned, but the disruption of oxidative phosphorylation slows relaxation.4. Poisoning of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation blocks all but the small initial part of the spontaneous relaxation of the potassium contracture and also interferes with relaxation induced by other means.5. The results are considered to favour the existence, in frog heart, of an active intracellular relaxing system which uses ATP as its substrate to lower the sarcoplasmic calcium concentration. This system is likely to be the sarcoplasmic reticulum but the mitochondria could also be involved.

1. A voltage clamp method utilizing a sucrose gap and glass microelectrodes was developed and used to study dog ventricular myocardial fibre bundles. The limitations and the reliability of this method are demonstrated by a series of tests.2. A dynamic sodium current, excited at membrane potentials more positive than -65 mV, was measured. The equilibrium potential for this large, rapid inward current depends directly on [Na]o, shifting 29·0 ± 2·3 mV (± S.E. of mean), as opposed to a theoretically expected value of 30·6 mV, when [Na]o is reduced to 31% of normal.3. Sodium current is inactivated by conditioning depolarizations. Complete inactivation occurs with conditioning potentials more positive than -45 mV, and 50% inactivation occurs at about -55 mV. The location of the inactivation curve shifts along the voltage axis, when [Ca]o is varied between 0·2 and 7·2 mM.4. A second, much smaller and slower net inward current, with a threshold around -30 mV, and an equilibrium potential above +40 mV was also observed.5. The `steady-state' current—voltage relationship (after 300-600 msec) exhibits inward-going (anomalous) rectification with negative slope between -50 and -25 mV.6. A small, very slowly developing component of outward current was observed at inside positive potentials. The equilibrium potential for this current, although slightly dependent on [K]o, is neither identical with the potassium equilibrium potential nor with the resting potential in normal Tyrode solution.7. Anatomical limitations, primarily resistance in the extracellular space within the bundle, prevent complete characterization of the rapid, large sodium current, but do not limit the application of the clamp method to the study of other, smaller and slower currents. The evidence for this is discussed extensively in the Appendix.	Voltage clamp experiments on ventricular myocardial fibres	G. W. Beeler, H. Reuter	5503866	1970-03-01	11

Twenty-one patients with muscular subaortic stenosis were treated with oral propranolol for periods of 6 to 34 months for a total of 42.5 patient years. The average follow-up was 2 years. Four patients with latent obstruction became asymptomatic on propranolol therapy. Of the 17 patients with resting obstruction, 7 improved, 2 were unchanged, 5 deteriorated, and 2 died during the period of treatment. The 7 patients with resting obstruction who are still improved on propranolol have had relatively short periods of treatment (average 15 months), and none experienced the degree of improvement that occurred in the patients with latent obstruction. This study indicates that propranolol is most effective in patients with muscular subaortic stenosis who have latent obstruction. It is of limited value in patients with resting obstruction because the benefit of propranolol therapy in the majority of these patients is eventually overtaken by progression in the disease.Images	Long-term propranolol therapy in muscular subaortic stenosis.

A method is described for performing type-specific anti-M precipitin tests on group A hemolytic streptococci in 1 mm. capillary pipettes. These tests require so much less precipitating serum than was formerly used that the method now seems to be practical.	TYPING GROUP A HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI BY M PRECIPITIN REACTIONS IN CAPILLARY PIPETTES	Homer F. Swift, Armine T. Wilson, Rebecca C. Lancefield	19871314	1943-08-01	1	
A bacterial substance has been described which gives a precipitin reaction with certain antisera to Group A streptococci. The precipitating antigen is present in various Gram-positive bacteria, including most hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and aerobic sporulating bacilli. It is not present in any of the Gram-negative species examined or in pneumococci, clostridia, or corynebacteria. Analysis of purified preparations obtained from Group A streptococci indicates that the antigen is a simple polymer of glycerophosphate. The identification has been confirmed by immunochemical studies, including precipitin tests and specific inhibition with synthetic polyglycerophosphates. In addition, the infrared spectra of bacterial and synthetic polyglycerophosphate are shown to be closely similar. Immunochemical analysis suggests that the amount of polyglycerophosphate present in Group A streptococci and staphylococci is approximately 1 per cent of the dry weight of the cells. The cellular localization and function of the polyglycerophosphate have not been established.

The immunoelectrophoretic characteristics of the known cellular antigens of serotype 17, Group A streptococci have been presented. These include C, M, T, and polyglycerophosphate. In addition, three hitherto undescribed antigens of serotype 17 have been encountered. The F antigen occurs in most serotype 17 strains, has a faster electrophoretic mobility than M, appears in acid, distilled water, and other extracts of harvested cells, is released from the cells in large quantity into the culture medium during growth when the pH is maintained at 7.3 or over, is probably protein in nature, and may play a minor role in mouse virulence of serotype 17 strains. Its antibodies do not confer bactericidal power on human blood. The E antigen is serotype-specific and is closely associated with the M antigen. The suggestion is made here that E is a part of the M molecule, acquiring independent electrophoretic mobility when separated from the rest of the M molecule by acid hydrolysis and carrying an antigenic determinant serologically distinct from the determinant on the rest of the M molecule. E can be recognized only by immunoelectrophoresis. Its role, if any, in virulence has not been established. The third antigen, E4, is a non-serotype-specific antigen found in most serological groups and types of hemolytic streptococci. It is serologically related to polyglycerophosphate, but its chemical nature has not been determined. It appears to be unrelated to virulence.

1. The linkage between the polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei is rapidly hydrolysed under mild acid-hydrolysis conditions. 2. The release of the polysaccharide is accompanied by the hydrolysis of an N-acetylhexosaminide linkage. The N-acetylhexosamine residue readily forms chromogen and it is concluded that it is substituted on C(3) by the adjacent sugar. 3. Continued heating of the polysaccharide in acid results in a slower release of reactive N-acetylhexosamine due to the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages within the polysaccharide. 4. After the linkage between the polysaccharide and mucopeptide has been hydrolysed, acid phosphatase will release approx. 40% of the total phosphorus as inorganic phosphate. 5. It is concluded that the polysaccharide component of the cell wall is joined through its reducing end group to a phosphate grouping in the mucopeptide.

1. Hydrochloric acid extracts of Streptococcus hæmolyticus contain type-specific, as well as non-type-specific, substances. The precipitates formed by these crude extracts with homologous antibacterial serum are flocculent, while those obtained with heterologous serum are usually disc-like. 2. The type-specific substance may be detected by the use of anti-bacterial sera absorbed with heterologous strains of hemolytic streptococci. Such absorbed sera are type-specific: they are precipitated only by extracts of strains of the homologous type. 3. Any heterologous strain of hemolytic streptococcus absorbs the antibodies for all other heterologous strains, but homologous strains absorb type-specific antibodies as well. Numerous repeated absorptions with heterologous hemolytic streptococci tend to lower the titer of the type-specific antibody. A possible explanation of this fact is suggested. 4. Three strains did not yield a type-specific substance; and it seems probable that they had lost this function because of long continued cultivation in artificial media. 5. Classification based on the precipitin test with absorbed serum agrees with that previously determined by agglutination and protection tests. The method is, therefore, applicable to the problem of classification of the hemolytic streptococci.	THE ANTIGENIC COMPLEX OF STREPTOCOCCUS HÆMOLYTICUS I.

In any one strain the occurrence of the previously recognized type-specific protein, M, is usually completely correlated with the presence of the recently recognized type-specific antigen, T. Strain C203 is exceptional in having the T substance of type 1 as well as the two type-specific antigens, M and T, characteristic of type 3. It does not have the M antigen of type 1. While other strains with similar antigenic peculiarities have not been encountered, it is probable that they occur, and the existence of such anomalies must be suspected when unusual serological reactions occur.

The matt and the glossy forms of four strains of hemolytic streptococci were used to immunize rabbits. Precipitin tests showed that rabbit sera prepared against matt organisms, whether virulent or avirulent for mice, contained type-specific antibody while sera prepared against completely degraded glossy organisms contained no type-specific antibody. Type-specific antibody was removed from the sera by absorption with homologous matt organisms but was unaffected by absorption with homologous glossy organisms. Passive protection experiments on mice showed that anti-matt sera were protective and anti-glossy sera non-protective against infection with homologous virulent organisms. Vaccination of mice with matt organisms rendered them immune to subsequent infection with homologous virulent cultures; but vaccination with glossy organisms established no active immunity.

Soil organisms have been isolated which elaborate induced enzymes capable of attacking group A and variant (V) streptococcal carbohydrates. The V enzyme hydrolyzes V carbohydrate extensively to dialyzable split products with resultant total loss of precipitating activity with homologous antisera. The split products inhibit the reaction between intact V carbohydrate and its antiserum: evidence is presented which indicates that rhamnose oligosaccharides are responsible for the inhibitory effect. The serological specificity of the V carbohydrate thus appears to be primarily dependent on a rhamnose-rhamnose linkage. The effect of the A enzyme on A carbohydrate is characterized by the removal of 50 to 70 per cent of the total glucosamine in the form of free N-acetyl-glucosamine. As a result of this treatment, the residual carbohydrate loses its reactivity with specific group A antisera and at the same time develops markedly increased cross-reactivity with V antisera. This cross-reactivity is in turn eliminated by treatment with V enzyme. The evidence suggests that the specificity of group A carbohydrate is determined to a large extent by side chains of N-acetyl-glucosamine which also serve to mask underlying rhamnose-rhamnose linkages with V specificity.

Strains of group A streptococci, types 30 and 12, were observed to grow in extremely long chains in liquid media to which homologous antiserum was added. Addition to the media of antisera to heterologous types of streptococci failed to produce long chain growth. The long chain effect was destroyed by absorption of the antiserum with organisms of homologous type but was unaffected by absorption with organisms of heterologous types. The reaction disappeared at concentrations of antisera smaller than 0.25 per cent and was independent of complement or other heat-labile serum factors. Addition of trypsin to the culture to remove M protein from cells prevented long chain formation. The long chain effect depended upon the constant presence of antibody to the media. In its absence, the organisms promptly reverted to short chain growth. The phenomenon appears to have general applicability to those strains rich in M protein with only an occasional strain not responding as described. Further studies are in progress to determine the cause of this atypical response. The applicability of this phenomenon in detecting type-specific antibody using indicator strains of a variety of streptococcal types is discussed.

The host ranges of bacteriophages for group A, types 1, 6, 12, and 25 and group C streptococci have been determined. The findings indicate that the susceptibility to these phages is primarily a group-specific phenomenon, although it is modified by several factors such as the hyaluronic acid capsule, lysogeny, and possibly the presence of surface proteins. Phage antibody studies indicate that while the group A phages are antigenically related, they are distinct from the group C phage. This is in agreement with the observation that group A phages are not specific for their homologous streptococcal types. The purified group C carbohydrate inactivates group C phage but not the group A phages, thus suggesting that the carbohydrate, a component of the cell wall, may serve as the phage receptor site. It has not been possible to inactivate the group A phages with group A carbohydrate. Phage lysis of groups A and C streptococci is accompanied by fragmentation of the cell wall since the C carbohydrate has been identified serologically and chemically in the supernate of centrifuged lysates. The immediate lysis of groups A and C hemolytic streptococci and their isolated cell walls by an accesory heat-labile lytic factor in fresh group C lysates is also described.

In further study of streptococci having the R antigen, the bactericidal test has been used instead of the mouse protection test in investigating the type-specific M antigens of these organisms. The results have been confirmed by M anti-M precipitin tests, and a correlation between the M and T antigens of the strains has been shown. On the basis of a specific M antigen, type 28 has been shown to comprise Griffith's strain Small and four other R-containing strains. A number of other strains previously thought to belong to type 28 on the basis of R antigen reactions have now been identified as belonging either to type 2 or to a new type, designated 48, which shows a one-way cross-relationship to type 13. The bactericidal test is suggested as a useful method for assessing M antigen in group A streptococci and for establishing type-specificity by means of a biological test which is more widely applicable than the standard mouse protection test.

It has been found by immunoelectrophoresis, that Group A streptococci release at least 20 distinct extracellular antigens in human tissues, as judged by naturally occurring antibodies present in normal pooled human gamma globulin. Several of these precipitin arcs have been identified with streptococcal antigens previously purified by electrophoresis and chromatography. Human gamma globulin, as well as several rheumatic fever sera, were shown to be remarkably potent in antistreptococcal antibodies, when compared to four horse antibody concentrates obtained by hyperimmunization with several streptococcal filtrates. A Group C streptococcal culture concentrate revealed 8 or 9 antigens for which corresponding antibodies were present in human gamma globulin.	THE ANALYSIS OF STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS VI.

A strain of Group A streptococcus previously considered to belong to Type 14 was shown to have two immunologically distinct M antigens, designated Type 14 and Type 51. Most strains having the Type 14 M antigen were found to have also the Type 51 M antigen, and are considered to belong to Type 14–51. Four strains had the Type 51 M antigen without the Type 14 M antigen and one strain had the Type 14 M antigen without the Type 51 M antigen. The failure of a variant to produce the known M antigen of the parent strain does not necessarily mean that the strain is M-, because a second M antigen may be present as was the case in several strains described here.

Intact bacterial membranes have been isolated from protoplasts prepared from Group A streptococci by a cell wall-dissolving enzyme. A membrane fraction with identical chemical and serological properties has been obtained by differential centrifugation of mechanically disrupted streptococci. The membrane is chemically distinct from the cell wall and is composed of 72 per cent protein, 26 per cent lipid, and 2 per cent carbohydrate. Capillary precipitin tests and analysis by microdiffusion have demonstrated that the membrane contains antigens distinct from those of the cell wall and from those of the cytoplasm which it envelops. Evidence is presented which demonstrates that this antigenic material is common to the membranes of Group A streptococci, and that it can be distinguished by immunodiffusion from related antigenic substances present in membranes of several other serological groups of hemolytic streptococci. This antigenic material does not cross-react with the membrane antigens of other Gram-positive cocci.	STUDIES OF L FORMS AND PROTOPLASTS OF GROUP A STREPTOCOCCI II.

Bacteriol. 85:536–540. 1963.—A heat-labile M protein antigen in protoplasts of a type 14 strain of group A Streptococcus has been demonstrated in a soluble form in the cytoplasm, and also bound to the protoplasmic membrane. When trypsinized whole cells (from which the M protein on the cell wall had been digested) or protoplasts were extracted with hot HCl, no M protein antigen was detected, although the antigen was routinely extracted from the cell walls of normal streptococci by the hot acid procedure. Various serological techniques, including the use of fluorescein-labeled type-specific antisera, were employed to demonstrate the M antigen in association with the membrane from osmotically lysed protoplasts.

1. T antigens of group A hemolytic streptococci have been obtained in soluble form by digestion of the bacterial cells with pepsin or trypsin. Large quantities of this antigen were readily extracted from type 1 strains, whereas only small amounts could be obtained from strains of other types. 2. The T antigen, prepared in this way from a type 1 strain, was partially purified by chemical precipitation and further enzymatic digestion. An active fraction, apparently protein in nature, was separated electrophoretically at pH 7.00. The separated material, pooled and analyzed at the same pH, gave only a single peak. The isoelectric point of this substance was about pH 4.50. An elementary analysis was obtained. Although the T antigen was resistant to digestion with proteolytic enzymes and ribonuclease, it was readily inactivated by heat, especially in acid media and in strong salt solutions. The serological activity of this purified T substance was lost after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 3. Analysis by means of the ultracentrifuge showed that the material was polydisperse and therefore probably impure. 4. The soluble form of the T substance was active in the precipitin reaction, in the fixation of complement, in inhibition of T agglutination, and as an antigen when injected into rabbits. The antibodies produced did not protect mice against infection with virulent strains of hemolytic streptococci containing the same T antigen. 5.

1. The polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei have been separated by mild conditions of acid hydrolysis. 2. Removal of the polysaccharide renders the mucopeptide susceptible to lysozyme. 3. The mucopeptide and polysaccharide components have been analysed and the results compared with those obtained previously. 4. The polysaccharides responsible for group specificity have a terminal reducing N-acetylgalactosamine residue substituted on C(3) by the adjacent sugar; estimation of this component gave an indication of the molecular weight of the polysaccharides. 5. Evidence has been obtained for the presence of rhamnosyl-(1→3)-N-acetylgalactosamine among the products of acid hydrolysis of the group B polysaccharide.ImagesFig. 2.

Lysis of trypsinized Group A streptococcal cell walls with phage-associated lysin releases into solution dialyzable and non-dialyzable mucopeptide fractions composed of N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid and alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, and glycine in addition to the characteristic group-specific carbohydrate. The latter substance contains appreciable amounts of N-acetylmuramic acid and the amino acids as well as N-acetylglucosamine and rhamnose. Hot formamide extraction of the cell walls results in a soluble fraction of group-specific carbohydrate and an insoluble residue. The Group A carbohydrate in this instance is composed of rhamnose and N-acetylglucosamine. The composition of the insoluble residue is similar to that of the mucopeptide fractions released from the cell wall by phage-associated lysin. This residue was shown by electron microscopy to be composed of discrete discs which appear similar in structure to the intact cell wall. The specific carbohydrate obtained by hot formamide extraction of Group A-variant cell walls was composed almost exclusively of rhamnose. The residue fraction was similar to that of Group A. The residue of cell walls extracted with hot formamide is extensively solubilized not only by phage-associated lysin and S. albus enzyme, but also by lysozyme, which has no measurable effect on the intact streptococcal cell wall.

Krause, Maclyn McCarty	13754097	1961-07-01	1	
The trypsinized cell walls of Group C streptococci contain two components, the group-specific carbohydrate and a mucopeptide polymer. Hot formamide extraction of Group C cell walls results in a soluble group-specific carbohydrate fraction and an insoluble mucopeptide residue. This mucopeptide, similar in composition to that of Groups A and A-variant streptococci, contains N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, and glycine. It is dissolved by the muralytic enzymes, including lysozyme, which does not attack the whole cell wall. Lysis of the cell wall by phage-associated lysin results in the release of soluble fragments composed of the elements of mucopeptide. Group C carbohydrate extracted with formamide is composed primarily of N-acetylgalactosamine and rhamnose. Serological studies suggest that the specificity of Group C carbohydrate is determined by the N-acetylgalactosamine.	STUDIES ON THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE STREPTOCOCCAL CELL WALL II.

1. A number of disaccharides and oligosaccharides have been isolated from the products of mild acid hydrolysis of the specific substance from Lactobacillus casei, serological group C. 2. The major disaccharide is O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-N-acetyl- d-galactosamine (B4) and evidence is presented for the structure of a tetrasaccharide composed of O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-d-galactose (B1) joined through its reducing end group to B4. 3. Disaccharide B1 is also a component of a trisaccharide O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-β- d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (A7). 4. A number of other oligosaccharides have been shown to be related structurally. 5. The ability of certain of the oligosaccharides to inhibit the precipitin reaction has been studied. The disaccharide B1 is more effective as an inhibitor than gentiobiose and the trisaccharide A7 is considerably more effective than B1. 6. These results have been compared with those obtained previously for the composition of the cell wall.

A method has been devised whereby the transplanted epidermis of mouse embryos can be selectively exposed to the action of a chemical carcinogen. Scharlach R was dissolved in olive oil with the aim of stimulating and attracting the epidermal cells, methylcholanthrene was added to the solution, and numerous fine globules of it were injected into the thigh muscles of adult mice together with fragments of embryo skin. Much of the oil underwent primary inclusion in the resulting cysts, and the proliferating epidermis, while forming them, extended to not a few of the outlying droplets with result that they too were added to the cyst contents. During these activities the methylcholanthrene came into direct contact with many of the epithelial cells, and later on the layer lining the cyst was continually exposed to the influence of the carcinogen. The epidermis underwent neoplastic changes with great rapidity; often in less than 4 weeks papillomas and carcinomas had arisen like those deriving from adult epidermis. The growths were punctate in origin and usually multiple. Many were transplanted to adults of the same homologous breed of mice that furnished the embryo material (mice of C strain). The grafts did not uniformly succeed as was the case with those of normal skin of embryos of the same stock,—which regularly grew at first in the new hosts and remained alive long after. The benign papillomas failed to live or barely survived, and the apparently malignant papillomas, though rapidly forming nodules of considerable size, usually regressed later. Some of the carcinomas also regressed or wholly failed, while others gave rise to progressively enlarging tumors. The best results were obtained with grafts in which several neoplasms were intermingled, these flourishing together in the new hosts. Methylcholanthrene in olive oil exerts an influence on epidermal cells like that of Scharlach R, stimulating them to multiply, attracting them, and causing them to mimic carcinomatous elements.

Experiments were carried out to learn whether the widely differing liabilities to induced epidermal tumors of individual mice and rabbits are due to a previous localization out of the blood of an agent capable of undergoing change when the skin is exposed to carcinogenic influences, and of producing tumors in consequence. On the assumption that such an agent would localize in increased quantity where cutaneous inflammation exists, like various inert substances of large molecule and the epidermotrophic viruses when circulating, skin areas on adult and new-born animals were for some weeks kept inflamed, and months later, when the areas appeared normal, methylcholanthrene was applied to them and to control areas on the same or other individuals. No differences were observable in tumor incidence. These results led to attempts to test whether embryo epidermis is capable of undergoing neoplastic change, and the work of Paper I was done which showed that epidermal tumors arise with great rapidity and regularity from embryo skin transplanted to adults of homologous strain (C strain) together with methylcholanthrene. Webster-Swiss mice proved unsuited to experiments of the sort owing to heterogeneity of the breed, the transplanted embryo skin dying in most instances before the methylcholanthrene introduced with it could have been carcinogenic. The skin of C3H embryos also did badly, as if from incompatibility in some instances but mostly because its epidermal cells proliferated less vigorously than those of C embryos and did not tolerate methylcholanthrene nearly so well. Despite these difficulties, epidermal tumors were occasionally induced, as also in the transplanted skin of Webster-Swiss embryos, and the growths appeared quite soon, all things considered. The effect of methylcholanthrene on the skin of sucklings, their mothers, and young adult mice of the C strain was studied in order to find out whether the rapid rate of neoplastic change in the transplanted epidermis of embryos is indicative of some liability connected with its period of development. The skin of new-born animals proved very refractory to the carcinogen, hair coming in at the same rate as on control litters and no perceptible inflammation occurring for about 2 weeks, although within this period the mothers of the treated animals and the young adults became hairless where the methylcholanthrene had been put and their skin was much inflamed. Later on, as the applications were kept up, similar changes took place in the sucklings, but none of these developed tumors during some 6 weeks of observation whereas growths appeared within 3 weeks on more than half of the mother mice and on some of the young adults. The failure to produce tumors in the sucklings seems to have been due to cutaneous conditions preventing the necessary exposure of the deeper epidermal cells to methylcholanthrene. In any projected correlation of age differences with the response of cells to carcinogens allowance must be made for such factors. The present findings give no ground for the supposition that embryo skin has any special liability to neoplastic change. The results of transferring the tumors derived from embryo epidermis to new hosts have made plain that the neoplastic state not infrequently entails disabilities which are crucial, the tumor cells failing to succeed unless aided. This holds true of some carcinomas as well as of papillomas. By transplanting pieces of the organs of C embryos together with methylcholanthrene tumors of many sorts besides the epidermal have been obtained. As yet only those of the stomach have been worked with extensively. They can be elicited as quickly and regularly as those of the epidermis and can be as easily transplanted. The findings as a whole render it impossible to suppose that the neoplastic potentialities possessed by transplanted embryo tissues are due to the lodgement in them of tumor-producing viruses as specialized in their effects as those now known, or of precursor agents conferring neoplastic liabilities specialized to the same degree. Some other possibilities are mentioned. The rarity of neoplasms at birth is due to the circumstances of intrauterine life and to its brevity, not to any lack of capacity of the cells of the embryo to undergo neoplastic change.

1. The soluble specific substance of Friedländer's bacillus is non-antigenic when dissociated from the cell. It is different for each type and it is highly reactive in the corresponding anti-S serum. 2. The nucleoprotein is antigenic, induces the species or protein antibody which reacts with capsule-free cells and protein derived from all types. Antiprotein sera do not react with either the encapsulated cell or the polysaccharide derived from it, and they offer no protection against infection. 3. Anti-R and antiprotein sera are identical in their behavior. 4. The carbohydrate of Friedländer's bacillus is demonstrable in filtrates of actively growing cultures and in the blood and urine of infected animals. 5. The protein is demonstrable in filtrates of only old, disintegrating cultures.	IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS OF CELL CONSTITUENTS OF ENCAPSULATUS PNEUMONIÆ (FRIEDLÄNDER'S BACILLUS)	Louis A.

The cross-reactions which interfere with satisfactory serological identification of hemolytic streptococcus are due to anticarbohydrate in the sera used for typing. This antibody can be removed easily by absorption with purified streptococcus carbohydrate, and type identification is then readily established. The serological classification of hemolytic streptococcus from throat infections contracted in New York during 1935 and 1936 showed the predominance of types 4, 13 and 22. Type 13 appeared to be the most serious in initiating rheumatic activity during this period of observation.	STUDIES ON THE SEROLOGICAL TYPING OF STREPTOCOCCUS HEMOLYTICUS	Ruth H. Pauli, Alvin F.

1. Two qualitatively different type-specific antigens, designated M and T, have been found present in matt variants of group A hemolytic streptococci, but only one of these, the T antigen, occurs in the degraded glossy variant. 2. The protein nature of the M antigen, present in matt variants only, has been demonstrated in previous work, but the chemical characteristics of the newly recognized antigenic factor, T, present in both variants, have not been determined. This T factor is identified only by its immunological reactions. It is unknown whether the two type-specific antigenic factors, M and T, occur as separate chemical entities in the matt variant or in conjugation. 3. Antibody to the type-specific protein, M, appears responsible for the M precipitin reaction, for type-specific protection, and, as a rule, for part of the type-specific agglutination of matt variants, but in type 1 it does not cause agglutination. 4. Antibody to the second type-specific antigen, T, seems to be solely responsible for type-specific agglutination of the glossy form and to play a large rôle in type-specific agglutination of the matt form, but apparently it is not involved in protection. This T antibody causes all of the type-specific agglutination of type 1. Consequently, type 1 matt and glossy variants agglutinate and absorb agglutinin alike, and antisera to both are identical in content of type-specific agglutinin though they differ in respect to M antibody. 5. Recognition of the principle underlying type-specific agglutination of glossy variants makes it possible to suggest, with certain reservations, the use of glossy variants for type classification by agglutination. These variants are suitable for preparing type-specific agglutinating antisera, and they form stable suspensions for use in the reaction. Improved methods are needed for deriving glossy from matt variants.	TYPE-SPECIFIC ANTIGENS, M AND T, OF MATT AND GLOSSY VARIANTS OF GROUP A HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI	Rebecca C.

1. A substance extracted from group A hemolytic streptococcus is described, which induces active immunity in mice, and in rabbits gives rise to precipitins and to protective antibodies passively transferable to mice. 2. The active immunity in mice is principally type-specific, but some degree of non-type-specific immunity is also developed. The passively transferable protective antibodies are type-specific with only a slight suggestion of non-type specificity. In the precipitin test, the rabbit immune sera give both type-specific and non-type-specific reactions which have not been fully analyzed serologically. 3. Substances contained in the extract absorb the protective antibodies from the serum of rabbits immunized with whole hemolytic streptococci. 4. The most satisfactory method of extraction so far developed is fully described. Chemical tests on the material are consistent with the presence of protein and nucleic acid. 5. The type-specific M substance, prepared as previously described, was compared in some of its antigenic properties with the above mentioned substance. It was found capable of inducing active immunity in mice and of absorbing protective antibody from anti-bacterial immune serum in a manner qualitatively similar to that obtained with the preparations made by the newer methods.

Hemolytic streptococci, when freshly isolated from pathogenic lesions, form characteristic matt colonies and contain the type-specific substance M. Two varieties of matt cultures, equally rich in type-specific substance, can be distinguished by the virulence of the organisms for mice: (1) the matt virulent variety, (2) the matt attenuated variety. The matt forms of hemolytic streptococci can be degraded to a third variety which forms glossy colonies and is always relatively avirulent. This is accomplished by prolonged cultivation on artificial media, by selection of colonies or by cultivation in homologous anti-M serum. In the process of degradation the cocci lose the major part of their type-specific substance but complete disappearance of type-specific substance rarely occurs. The glossy variant form, when fully degraded, is highly stable; but glossy cultures which have retained some type-specific substance can occasionally be reverted to the original matt form. Toxic filtrates from matt and glossy cultures are approximately equal in skin reactivity. No relationship appears to exist between virulence and toxigenicity.

The lysis of group A hemolytic streptococci by extracellular enzymes of Streptomyces albus has been studied. The most favorable material for fractionation of the lytic enzymes was obtained by surface growth on shallow layers of liquid medium containing an acid hydrolysate of casein, glucose, and salts. The results of fractionation experiments show that the potent proetolytic enzyme of Streptomyces albus is not able to lyse group A streptococci, and that the initiation of lysis is dependent upon the action of a second, non-proteolytic enzyme. The nature of the non-proteolytic enzyme has not been determined. It does not appear to be a ribonuclease or a lysozyme-like enzyme.

The phenomenon of apparent loss of group-specific carbohydrate in the course of mouse passage of group A streptococci has been subjected to further study, and several additional variants showing this property have been described. The loss of group reactivity is shown to be due to an alteration in the chemical structure and serological specificity of the cell wall carbohydrate. This alteration appears to be essentially the same in each of the variants available for study. The carbohydrate of the variant strains (V) contains the same two monosaccharide components as the group A carbohydrate (A), but they are present in different proportions. Precipitating sera reactive with V carbohydrate have been prepared, and the A and V carbohydrates have been compared by qualitative and quantitative precipitin analysis. A second type of variation has been encountered during mouse passage. This variation is characterized by the occurrence of a cell wall carbohydrate (I) intermediate in chemical and serological properties between the A and V carbohydrates. The I carbohydrate reacts with both A and V antisera and does not appear to be a simple mixture of A and V carbohydrate. Similarly, antisera against the intermediate strain contain antibodies reactive with both A and V carbohydrates, and evidence is presented indicating that in part this represents antibody with double specificity.

1. Living pneumococcus cells contain a group of enzymes, the bacteriolytic system, capable of causing the lysis of heat-killed pneumococci (R and S variants irrespective of type derivation). This lysis expresses itself by a loss of the Gram staining reaction, a disintegration of the cell body, and a clearing of the bacterial suspension. 2. Under certain conditions of treatment with the bacteriolytic complex, it is possible to render the cocci Gram-negative without changing their characteristic morphology, or causing any appreciable clearing of the cell suspension. 3. The enzyme responsible for this change has been partially purified, and some of its properties described. 4. The cellular structure which is responsible for the Gram-positive reaction of pneumococci is resistant to proteolytic enzymes, and is still present when tryptic digestion has reduced the heat-killed cell to a body which has lost 75 per cent of its original weight, and contains only 8 per cent nitrogen. 5. The same enzyme preparation which attacks pneumococci is also capable of liberating reducing sugars from some acetyl amino glucose glucuronides of animal and bacterial origin. The possibility is considered, and discussed, that one and the same enzyme in the autolytic complex is capable of attacking both types of substrates.	THE AUTOLYTIC SYSTEM OF PNEUMOCOCCI	Rene J.

1. Proteolytic enzymes destroy the type-specific M antigen of group A hemolytic streptococci not only when the M substance is contained in cell-free extracts but also when it is a component of the living cell. 2. The injection of enzyme-treated cultures into rabbits fails to induce the formation of M antibodies, but does result in the production of T antibodies and, therefore, provides a method of preparing anti-T sera free from M antibodies. 3. Exposure to these enzymes does not kill the bacteria. Virulence and the ability to form M substance are restored on subculture and animal inoculation. 4. The study of the effect of proteolytic enzymes on group A hemolytic streptococci provides new techniques for analyzing the antigenic composition of these microorganisms.

1. Type-specific antibodies were demonstrated by the indirect bacteriostatic test in sera from human adults convalescing from group A streptococcal infection of the upper respiratory tract. The time of appearance of the antibodies varied from 3 to 5 weeks; and they persisted in 2 patients for at least 37 weeks after the onset of the infection. 2. The specificity of the antibody response in one serum was tested with strains of 7 heterologous types; in another, with 6; and in the third, with 2; but in no instance were cross-reactions observed. Moreover, each convalescent serum showed approximately equal bacteriostasis for 7 different strains of the same type as that which caused the infection. 3. The antibodies were specifically absorbed from the serum by homologous heat-killed streptococci, but not significantly by strains of heterologous types. 4. The specific M antigen of the streptococcal cell with its respective antibody, and not the T substance, appeared to be concerned in the reaction. 5. In spite of numerous technical difficulties inherent in the method, this bacteriostatic test provides a useful procedure for studying type-specific immunity in streptococcal infections.

Cell wall preparations of uniform chemical constitution have been obtained from several strains of group A streptococci. The isolated cell walls are dissolved by the same fractions of the Streptomyces albus enzymes that are effective in the lysis of intact cells, and it is likely that enzymatic lysis of group A streptococci is effected by an attack on the cell wall. The streptococcal cell wall, as prepared in this study, consists of approximately two-thirds carbohydrate and one-third protein. Small amounts of other components may be present. The carbohydrate component, which is composed primarily of N-acetyl-glucosamine and rhamnose, is the group-specific C carbohydrate. The evidence indicates that one of the streptomyces enzymes is directed toward the carbohydrate component of the cell wall.

"A group A, type 28 protein antigen, resistant to tryptic digestion and previously considered to be a type-specific substance, was purified and its chemical and immunological properties studied. This protein lacks the characteristic properties of a type-specific M antigen since it is apparently unrelated to virulence and does not induce the formation of protective antibodies although precipitins are readily produced. It is designated the R antigen. The R antigen in addition to occurring in ""type 28"" group A strains also occurs in some strains of streptococci of other serological groups. Protective antibodies, distinct from precipitins for the R antigen, are present in ""type 28"" antibacterial sera. The antigens responsible for protection have not been identified, and it is possible that several different types may be included among strains designated as type 28 on the basis of the R antigen. The purified R antigen is phosphorus-free and has a sulphur content of 1.04 per cent. In the ultraviolet a maximum absorption was obtained at a wave length of 280 mµ and a minimum at 254 mµ. Electrophoretically the R antigen was found to be 95 per cent homogeneous at most pH values, but at pH 4.6 the main peak separated into two peaks of approximately equal areas, both containing serologically active material. The interpretation of this finding is at present uncertain. The isoelectric pH was at 4.5 in sodium acetate buffer of 0.1 ionic strength. The purified R antigen sedimented in the ultracentrifuge as a single boundary."

Type-specific M antigen was extracted by heating type 1 group A streptococci at pH 2 in a boiling water bath. The protein was then purified by digestion with a preparation of crystalline ribonuclease which was free of proteolytic activity. It was further purified by fractional precipitation with (NH4)2SO4. Elementary chemical analysis of the preparation thus obtained showed an absence of phosphorus and a sulfur content of 2.46 per cent. In the ultraviolet the maximum absorption was at a wave length of 276 mµ and the minimum at 255 mµ. In electrophoresis experiments the preparation showed a single peak in the pH range of 3 to 9, but considerable boundary spreading was observed. The type 1 M antigen was isoelectric at pH 5.3 in sodium acetate buffer of ionic strength 0.1. The serological reactivity of the protein isolated was typical of type 1 M antigen. This protein induced the formation in rabbits of type-specific precipitins and protective antibodies. The absorption of type 1 antibacterial serum with the purified M antigen removed both the protective antibodies and the type-specific precipitins from the serum.

Using a highly concentrated and partially purified streptolysin O preparation, migrating agar precipitins have been found in 94 of 143 human sera from patients with a variety of diseases. Most of those showing no bands, had very low antistreptolysin titers. A correlation was found between the migration rates of these bands and the antistreptolysin titer. A strong trend toward a straight line relationship was apparent when the ASO titers were plotted on a logarithmic scale. In addition, a roughly positive correlation was found between the intensity of these bands and the antistreptolysin O titers. The finding of high levels of antistreptolysin O activity and slowly migrating heavy bands in normal pooled human gamma globulin supported the above observations. Very similar results were obtained with rabbit and guinea pig sera after immunization with the streptolysin O concentrates. The data strongly indicate that antistreptolysin O activity in human sera is generally due to precipitating antibody, and that non-specific inhibitors are not usually involved, even with low titered sera. Rabbit and guinea pig antisera to the oxidized inactive and to the reduced active forms of streptolysin O showed no obvious differences. Attempts to demonstrate immunological differences between the two states of streptolysin were apparently complicated by proteolysis, due to contamination of the concentrates with proteinase precursor.

It has been shown by agar precipitin tests (Ouchterlony and Oakley) that human sera may contain from 0 to 5 antibodies against antigens present in a partially purified streptolysin O preparation, and from 0 to 7 antibodies against antigens in a crude ammonium sulfate concentrate of the streptococcal culture supernate used. These antigens were prepared from a Group A hemolytic streptococcus (strain C203S). Strong evidence was presented suggesting that some of the bands seen with streptolysin O concentrate represented antibody reponses to streptococcal antigens heretofore undescribed. Tests were also carried out with other streptococcal antigens, including streptokinase-desoxyribonuclease mixture from Group C streptococci (varidase-Lederle), crystalline proteinase, proteinase precursor, C carbohydrate, and sonic vibrated streptococcal cell extracts (group A, C203S). Fewer bands were seen with these preparations, and with some they were quite uncommon. The observations indicated that the predominating antibody responses in human streptococcal infections were to extracellular products of the micro-organisms, and only very slightly and infrequently to intracellular antigens. The human sera studied included sera from patients with active or convalescent rheumatic fever, and non-rheumatic subjects suffering from a variety of illnesses. As was expected, the rheumatic subjects showed antibody responses to many more of the antigens present in these preparations than did the nonrheumatic group. Pooled normal human gamma globulin was found to contain many of the antibodies found in potent human sera. This finding confirmed the antigen-antibody nature of the bands seen with individual sera. The epidemiological significance of these findings with gamma, globulin was briefly discussed. It was found that rabbit, guinea pig, and human antibody precipitin bands join quite readily in the Ouchterlony tests. This finding adds another tool for the identification of the precipitin bands found with human sera. Evidence was obtained which indicated differing immunological specificities of two samples of streptococcal desoxyribonuclease, one from Group A, the other from a Group C streptococcus. The value of these technics as representing a new approach to the study of human infectious disease was discussed.

"As evidenced by precipitin analysis with pooled human gamma globulin, at least 12 distinct antigens were produced in cultures by one strain of Group A streptococcus (C203S). It was suggested on this basis, that these antigens were produced in vivo during human infections. By the combined use of continuous flow electrophoresis on paper curtains, and column chromatography with calcium phosphate gels, five of these have been isolated in a probable high state of purity. One of the components was obtained from culture filtrates of a Group C streptococcal strain. Three of the purified antigens have been tentatively identified as streptolysin ""O"", diphosphopyridinenucleotidase, and proteinase precursor. The latter could be very readily crystallized, and appears ""identical"" with that described by Elliott. The DPNase was of extremely high potency, 1 mg. being capable of destroying 12.6 gm. of DPN in 7½ minutes at 37°C. The identity of the other two components is uncertain as yet. They are distinct from each other and the above products immunologically, and are not related to the ""C"" carbohydrate. The applicability of these methods for the analysis of infectious diseases generally was discussed."	THE USE OF PRECIPITIN ANALYSIS IN AGAR FOR THE STUDY OF HUMAN STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS III. THE PURIFICATION OF SOME OF THE ANTIGENS DETECTED BY THESE METHODS	Seymour P. Halbert	13575674	1958-09-01	1	
"Studies on the purification of group A streptococcal extracellular antigens detectable with naturally occurring human antibodies from normal individuals have been extended. It has been shown that streptococcal electrophoretic fractions intermediate between the most rapidly migrating components are quite complex. In the calcium phosphate chromatography of adjacent electrophoretic fractions, particular antigenic components desorbed at similar buffer elution steps. It is clear from the results obtained that substantially more extracellular antigens than the twelve heretofore recognized are secreted in human beings during infection, as judged by their detection with human antibodies. The precise number is not yet known, but is probably greater than 16. Of the nine components which thus far have been separated rather well from the others, four were previously identified as streptolysin ""O,"" diphosphopyridine nucleotidase, proteinase precursor, and desoxyribonuclease B. The accumulated data substantiated these previous identifications. The identity of a fifth antigen has been made as a possible complex of C carbohydrate and protein. Tentative evidence for the relationship of a sixth component to scarlet fever toxin has been presented. It has been shown that rechromatography of crystalline proteinase precursor and desoxyribonuclease B on calcium phosphate columns resulted in elution principally at the expected stepwise increase in buffer concentration. Attempts to isolate antigens present as mixtures in some calcium phosphate chromatographic peaks, by rechromatography on DEAE or CM cellulose columns resulted in only limited further purifications."

1. The rapid death which occurred after intravenous injection of activated streptolysin O from. Group A or Group C streptococci was always preceded by profound electrocardiographic alterations. After several multiples of the LD50 doses, cardiac electrical arrest or fibrillation could occur within 2 to 4 seconds after completion of the injection. 2. The streptolysin O preparations used were rather highly purified, but were known to be contaminated with small amounts of one or two other immunologically distinct components. Evidence that the observed results were due to streptolysin O was obtained by tests of the reversibly oxidized materials, and by cholesterol inactivation, as well as by in vivo protection with human gamma globulin rich in antistreptolysin antibodies. 3. Four non-streptolysin streptococcal antigens, partially or highly purified, failed to produce similar electrocardiographic changes, and were much less toxic. One of these was 3 X recrystallized and 1 X rechromatographed streptococcal proteinase. Shigella paradysenteriae type III endotoxin also did not produce striking electrocardiographic abnormalities. 4. A working hypothesis has been developed implicating streptolysin O as the etiological streptococcal factor responsible for the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, which seems to account for the principal features of this illness.

Azoproteins prepared with p-aminophenyl-β-N-acetyl-glucosaminide react in precipitin tests with Group A streptococcal antisera. The reaction is nonreciprocal, and antisera to the azoprotein do not react with Group A carbohydrate. Phenyl-N-acetyl-glucosaminides inhibit the reaction of Group A carbohydrate with homologous antisera and with antisera to the azoprotein. The β-anomer is more effective as an inhibitor than the α-anomer. Formation by a soil bacillus of the enzyme which removes N-acetyl-glucosamine from Group A carbohydrate is induced by phenyl-β-N-acetyl-glucosaminide but not by the α-compound. The enzyme, like the glucosaminidase of emulsin, appears to be specific for β-glucosaminides. Neither the induced enzyme nor emulsin effectively remove all of the N-acetyl-glucosamine from the azoprotein antigens. The findings support the view that β-N-acetyl-glucosaminide side chains represent the major antigenic determinant of Group A streptococcal carbohydrate.

The lysis of cell walls of hemolytic streptococci by a phage-associated lysin has been described. A method is presented for preparing the lysin from Group C streptococcal phage lysates. Following lysis almost all of the cell wall carbohydrate is recovered in solution. This material has the serological reactivity, physical-chemical properties, and values for nitrogen, rhamnose, and glucosamine similar to those of the carbohydrate isolated from the cell walls by the Streptomyces albus enzyme. Group C carbohydrate isolated by either enzyme inactivates Group C bacteriophage. The protein liberated by the lysin from Group A Type 6 cell walls gives a type-specific precipitin reaction with homologous rabbit antiserum. Preliminary data are presented on the ammonium sulfate fractionation and the electrophoretic separation of a protein fraction with the serological reactivity of M protein.

L forms of Group A streptococci have been isolated by the use of penicillin gradient agar plates. Osmotically fragile protoplasts of Group A streptococci have been obtained by the use of Group C phage-associated lysin which lyses Group A streptococci and their isolated cell walls. Membranes surrounding these enzymatically derived protoplasts have been isolated, and chemical and immunological studies indicate that they are free of cell wall carbohydrate and M protein. The streptococcal protoplasts reproduce as colonies which are morphologically indistinguishable from streptococcal L forms. Evidence is presented to show that these two streptococcal derivatives are serologically and physiologically related to each other as well as to the parent streptococcal strain from which they were isolated.

"The chemical and immunological characteristics of the type-specific substance (M) of Streptococcus hæmolyticus are considered. 1. A summary of the evidence for the protein nature of this substance follows: (a) It is precipiated by the usual protein precipitants such as, dilute alcohol, dilute acetic acid, and picric acid. (b) It contains 14 per cent protein nitrogen after considerable purification. (c) It is progressively destroyed by removal of the NH2 group by treatment with nitrous acid. (d) It is completely and readily digested by trypsin and by pepsin. 2. ""Purified"" extracts react in relatively high dilution with homologous antibacterial sera, but do not precipitate most heterologous antibacterial sera or sera potent in non-type-specific antibodies for the group reactive nucleoprotein P or for the species-specific probable carbohydrate C. Attempts to immunize rabbits with the type-specific protein have been unsuccessful, with simple salt solution extracts of streptococci as well as with purified solutions. This protein seems, therefore, to have the characteristics of a haptene. The type-specific substance (M) is contrasted with the so called nucleoprotein (P) which shows group relationships with nucleoproteins of related species and is the only fraction of hemolytic streptococcus extracts so far obtained which, after separation from the bacterial cell, is a true antigen leading to antibody production when injected into rabbits. The occurrence of another non-type-specific protein (Y) is suggested by occasional cross-reactions of purified M with certain antibacterial sera. Since it has not been separated from extracts containing the type-specific M, little is known of it either chemically or serologically.

1. The majority of strains of hemolytic streptococci from puerperal infections of the uterus were identified serologically as members of the Group A described by Lancefield. 2. The majority of strains isolated from the birth canal of women whose puerperium was afebrile were not members of Group A. 3.

1. All except two of 106 strains of hemolytic streptococci isolated from man, other animals, milk, and cheese have been classified into five groups, which bear a definite relationship to the sources of the cultures. These broad groups may be subdivided into specific types by methods discussed elsewhere. The specific group classification is made possible by employing two special reagents: (a) extracts prepared by treatment of the bacteria with hot hydrochloric acid, and (b) serum of animals immunized with formalinized cultures. This differentiation is not detected by the agglutination reaction. The grouping agrees with that described by other investigators on the basis of cultural and biochemical characteristics. 2. The group-specific substance present in strains of Group A has been identified chemically as carbohydrate in nature. The chemical composition of the specific substances upon which the specificity of the other groups depends has not been determined. It seems not unlikely, however, that all of them may belong in the general class of carbohydrates, each being chemically distinct and serologically specific in the individual groups.

1. The occurrence of closely related T antigens in the series composed of types 15, 17, 19, 23, and 30 accounts for most of the cross reactions observed among these types. Similarly T antigens, unrelated to the first series but mutually related, occur in a second series comprising types 4, 24, 26, 28, 29, and 46. 2. Matt variants of each of the eleven types studied possess type-specific M antigens demonstrable either by precipitin or agglutinin reactions. 3. In seven of these types, strains have been encountered which do not possess the T antigen usually associated with the type in question. 4. Procedures are outlined in the appendix for preparing specific antisera for the classification of these types by the slide agglutination technique.

1. In this study a series of experiments showing the antigenic relationship of type 10 and type 12 group A hemolytic streptococci is reported. Agglutinin, precipitin, and passive protection tests with unabsorbed and reciprocally absorbed antisera were employed to show that representative type 10 and 12 strains contain serologically identical M antigens but unrelated type-specific T antigens. 2. Twenty-three other strains of group A hemolytic streptococci previously classified as either type 10 or type 12, collected from various sources, were shown to have an antigenic composition similar to one or the other of the two representative type strains. 3. The relationship of the two specific antigens, M and T, must be considered when any method employing the agglutinin reaction for the typing of group A hemolytic streptococci is used.

1. Group A hemolytic streptococci have been described which do not agglutinate in anti-T serum because they lack T antigen. 2. Other strains occur which contain T antigen yet do not agglutinate in anti-T serum because T agglutination is blocked by the presence of large amounts of M substance in the streptococci. 3. Strains belonging to a number of types have been analyzed to determine their antigenic composition with respect to M and T antigens.

Antigens capable of fixing complement specifically with the appropriate antibodies have been prepared from brain tissue of hamsters and mice infected with the viruses of St. Louis, Japanese, Western, and Eastern encephalitis, and with the West Nile virus. The antigens were freed of the material which reacts with normal serum by means of centrifugation at relatively high speed. In addition, the infectivity of the preparation was destroyed by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Cross reactions were demonstrated by means of the complement-fixation technique with materials from animals infected with the viruses of Eastern and Western equine encephalitis. No relationship was detectable by this procedure between St. Louis, Japanese, and West Nile viruses. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation and correlation of the immunological reactions of the groups of neurotropic viruses, since the equine agents are apparently unrelated when studied by neutralization and cross-immunity tests while these methods provide evidence of the presence of common antigenic structures in the St. Louis, Japanese, and West Nile agents.

1. Nasopharyngeal carrier states of several weeks to several months duration were induced in the Macaca mulatta by the intranasal inoculation with matt strains of group A streptococci. 2. Following such a successful inoculation with a particular type of group A streptococcus, the animal was usually resistant to reimplantation with that same type for several months to a year or more, although reimplantation with a heterologous type could generally be easily effected. 3. This resistance was shown to be closely correlated with the antibodies directed toward the type-specific M antigen, not toward the T antigen of the strains employed. 4. A majority (83.8 per cent) of the animals in which intranasal inoculation was followed by successful implantation developed significant increases in the antistreptolysin O titres of their sera; and in a limited number of instances, type-specific agglutinins and bacteriostatic antibodies were demonstrable in the animals' sera following successful implantation. 5. Nasopharyngeal carrier states could not be induced with the glossy, avirulent variants of group A streptococci; these animals, moreover, failed to show antibody responses and were susceptible to implantation with the matt variants of the homologous glossy strains. 6. The findings are in accord with the known facts regarding immunity to group A streptococci gained through experiments on rodents; and the possible relationship of these observations to the problem of type-specific immunity in human beings is discussed.

"The ""warts"" which tar elicits on rabbit skin (papillomas, carcinomatoids, frill horns) are true tumors, benign growths expressive of slight yet irreversible deviations of epidermal cells from the normal. The neoplastic condition gives the cells a superiority over their neighbors when both are submitted to the same encouraging influences, and then they proliferate into tumors. Their state entails such disabilities, though, that they are unable to maintain themselves under ordinary circumstances, and consequently growths composed of them disappear when no longer aided. Often the neoplastic cells resume the normal aspect and habit of life long before the tumor mass is gone; and they may persist as part of an apparently normal epidermis, retaining their neoplastic potentialities for months after all signs of the growth have disappeared. In these instances it can be made to appear again, sometimes repeatedly, by non-carcinogenic stimulation of the skin (wound healing, turpentining). There is reason however to suppose that in the end the tumor cells, unless helped, die or are cast off. It is plain that the neoplastic state does not necessarily connote independence of behavior or success in tumor formation. On the contrary it may render cells unable to survive or endow them with powers which they can exert only under favoring conditions. This is the case with the cells composing the tar warts of rabbits. In the lack of such conditions the cells of these growths do not manifest themselves but remain in a subthreshold neoplastic state, whereas if aided they form neoplasms. The deviations from the normal represented by the benign tar tumors of rabbits are slight and limited in character, but further deviations in larger variety may be superimposed upon them, with result in malignant tumors, growths possessed of a greater, though not always absolute, independence. Tar cancers usually come about in this way, by successive, step-like deviations from the normal, and so also do the cancers which derive from virus-induced papillomas as well as many human carcinomas. After cells have become cancerous they frequently undergo further changes, some apparently step-like in character, and all taking the direction of greater malignancy. The hypotheses that tumors are due to somatic mutations and to viruses respectively are discussed in the light of these phenomena."

The effects of the rabbit papilloma virus upon tar tumor tissue are widely various, as the present paper and previous ones attest. It enables some of the benign tar tumors of domestic rabbits (papillomas, carcinomatoids) to establish themselves after implantation,—which they are unable to do under ordinary circumstances, being dependent upon favoring factors; and it may drive them to active proliferation without altering their morphology. Some growths it fails to influence and some it converts into virus papillomas. Often, however, it brings about cytological changes which are indicative of a combination of its influence with that of the undetermined factor motivating the original tumor. The resulting neoplasm exhibits a blend of characteristics. The virus makes some benign tar tumors become cancerous forthwith, the malignancy developing without intermediate virus papillomatosis. It can be readily imposed upon some of the squamous cell carcinomas which tar elicits in its natural host, the cottontail rabbit, and it may drive such tumors to proliferate faster, or alter them morphologically, or do both. Its stimulating effect is especially pronounced in the case of those tar cancers that are slow-growing. Since the virus can influence tar cancers markedly, one can scarcely suppose it to be devoid of effect upon the cancers of the same type which derive from the papillomas it has itself engendered. Other implications of the work are discussed.	THE ACTIVATING, TRANSFORMING, AND CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS OF THE RABBIT PAPILLOMA VIRUS (SHOPE) UPON IMPLANTED TAR TUMORS	Peyton Rous, John G. Kidd	19870999	1940-05-31	1	
Methods were developed for a study of the relations existing between viruses and living cells. It was found that vaccinia and the virus causing the infectious fibroma of rabbits (Shope) rapidly become fixed upon tissue cells freed as individuals and submitted to virus in suspension. This happens whether the cells are alive or have been killed with heat or ultraviolet light. The virus does not come away during agitation of the cells with Tyrode solution and repeated washings with large amounts of it. The exposure to neutralizing antisera of cells carrying virus fails to affect this latter significantly if the cells are alive, whereas if they are dead the activity of the virus is nullified. Cells freed as individuals from tissue cultures of vaccinia and the Shope tumor carry these viruses in abundance through repeated washings, and, if living, protect them from the influence of a neutralizing serum, whereas killed cells exert no such protection. The findings would appear to throw light on the way in which viruses gain a foothold in the host; and they suggest reasons for the persistence of some viruses in recovered animals and for the unsatisfactory results of serum treatment instituted during the course of virus diseases. The virus causing the Shope fibroma has been successfully maintained in cultures of the growth. It is closely associated with the cells, almost none being present in the culture fluid. Certain of its other attributes have been determined. Vaccinia greatly damages the cells of cultures of rabbit embryo in which it is under propagation.

"Tarring the ears of rabbits of one sort with a single kind of tar evoked epidermal tumors of a few sharply defined types, namely ordinary papillomas, carcinoids, carcinomas, and ""frill horns."" These last, relatively infrequent, are now recognized for the first time. The carcinoids have proved to be the expression of a spurious malignancy of papillomas, resulting from intercurrent influences, and they were wholly dependent upon these for their threatening aspect and behavior. Chief amongst such influences was continued tarring. It had the effect of establishing the papillomas, stimulated their proliferation, complicated their morphology, and rendered some of them disorderly, aggressive, and anaplastic. It brought all of the tissues of the ears into an excitable state, and often this state endured long after the skin had apparently returned to normal. The characters of the papilloma-carcinoids and of the frill horns were so different and distinctive as to imply the action of differing, specific causes. The papillomas were very like those induced with the Shope virus, and hence a point-to-point comparison was made of their manifestations, including the derivation of carcinomas from them. This comparison demonstrated that the unknown cause of the tar papillomas provoked neoplastic phenomena which were identical in all essential respects with those due to the virus. To suppose, for experimental purposes, that the papillomas which tarring elicits are caused by a virus rendered pathogenic by this procedure, is to demand least of the unknown. Yet it does not follow that they must be due to a virus."	A COMPARISON OF VIRUS-INDUCED RABBIT TUMORS WITH THE TUMORS OF UNKNOWN CAUSE ELICITED BY TARRING	Peyton Rous, John G. Kidd	19870854	1939-02-28	1	
A considerable variety of tumors, both benign and malignant, result from the localization of the rabbit papilloma virus in skin which has been prepared by repeated tarrings. They appear only in individuals highly susceptible to the action of the virus, and are more likely to be engendered by highly pathogenic inocula. No evidence has been found that differences in the potentialities of the virus entities are responsible for the diversity of the growths. This is referable to changes in the epidermal cells; and much more preliminary tarring is required to produce these changes than suffices to cause localization of the virus out of the blood stream with a resulting papillomatosis of the ordinary sort. The character of the individual anomalous tumors depends in some degree upon the extent of the preparatory changes in the cells, malignant growths being more frequent when the epidermis has been tarred for a relatively long period. All are focal or punctate in origin, and they exhibit their peculiar characters from the first, none being due to secondary alterations in ordinary papillomas. Tarring after the virus has localized in the epidermis does not significantly increase their number. They are the outcome of the state of the cells at the time of virus infection. Tarring exerts important influences in addition to changing the cells in such a way that unusual tumors result from the action of the virus. The procedure is notably effective in determining localization of the virus out of the blood stream; enables it to produce growths when otherwise it would not do so though present in the tarred skin; stimulates the proliferation of the tumors engendered; makes them disorderly and aggressive; and hastens the anaplasia of such of them as are malignant. It has similar effects upon the tar tumors, as will be demonstrated in a subsequent paper.	THE CARCINOGENIC EFFECT OF A PAPILLOMA VIRUS ON THE TARRED SKIN OF RABBITS II. MAJOR FACTORS DETERMINING THE PHENOMENON: THE MANIFOLD EFFECTS OF TARRING	John G. Kidd, Peyton Rous	19870803	1938-09-30	1	
"The benign tumors of rabbit skin which appear in response to benzpyrene and methylcholanthrene are nearly all of the same kinds that tar produces, namely frill horns, papillomas, and carcinomatoids; but the collateral effects of these agents render many of them very different from the tar tumors. The connective tissue of the corium is so slowly excited by the pure hydrocarbons that for a long while it furnishes to most of the growths only a scanty stroma, when any, and in consequence they remain small,—low, dry, indolent, bas-relief affairs, made up almost entirely of the neoplastic epithelium,—not florid, fleshy excrescences with a large connective tissue component, such as tarring calls forth. The frill horns usually desquamate instead of building up like those due to tar, and some of their cells undergo a dyskeratotic change with result in spherical, homogeneous, deep-staining bullet-like elements, which give to the growths a singular aspect. In a frill horn due to benzpyrene numerous inclusion bodies were come upon which would seem to have been the result of intercurrent infection with a ""passenger virus."" Benzpyrene and methylcholanthrene produce papillomas, carcinomatoids, and frill horns in very different proportionate numbers from those obtaining when tar is the carcinogen. Tar gives rise much more frequently to carcinomatoids, —papillomas urged on to mimic cancers,—as would follow from its pronounced stimulating influence; yet it seldom produces frill horns whereas the pure hydrocarbons do so frequently. All three agents cause many more cells to become potentially capable of forming tumors than do so ordinarily, but the latent neoplastic elements on which tar exerts a promoting influence, causing them to form visible growths, are in general not the same as those which respond to benzpyrene and methylcholanthrene. Yet the relatively rare occurrence of frill horns due to tar cannot be wholly explained in this way and it becomes necessary to suppose that tar seldom changes normal cells into frill horn cells. Benzpyrene and methylcholanthrene give rise now and again to sebaceous adenomas, as tar does not. But tar does away with the sebaceous glands at an early period whereas the other two carcinogens cause them to increase notably in number. No evidence has been obtained that tar, benzpyrene, methylcholanthrene, arsenical preparations, or benzene,—which produces tumors of rabbit skin occasionally (1),—bring about any neoplastic changes peculiar to them individually when they act upon cells of a single sort, those of the stratum germinativum of rabbit epidermis. Yet the experimental findings make plain that these agents exert no inconsiderable influence on the morphology of the benign cutaneous growths they call forth and on the frequency with which this or that kind occurs. In appraising the action of carcinogens one must take into account not only the capacity of these agents to induce neoplastic change and to promote, or perhaps suppress, tumor growth but an ability to condition to no inconsiderable extent both the kind of tumor arising and its structure."	THE DETERMINING INFLUENCE OF TAR, BENZPYRENE, AND METHYLCHOLANTHRENE ON THE CHARACTER OF THE BENIGN TUMORS INDUCED THEREWITH IN RABBIT SKIN	William F. Friedewald, Peyton Rous	19871402	1944-08-01	1	
Rabbit skin can be rendered abnormally susceptible to papilloma virus infection by preliminary treatments with a variety of agents. The most effective agents thus far found are 0.3 per cent methylcholanthrene in benzene and a mixture in equal parts of turpentine and acetone, applied four or five times at 2 day intervals. When virus is inoculated into skin altered by these agents, either intradermally or by inunction after scarification, papillomas appear earlier and in greater number than on normal skin, and much higher dilutions give rise to growths. The method provides a means of detecting amounts of virus which cause no papillomas upon inoculation into normal skin. Papilloma virus material which is rubbed into scarified normal or hyperplastic skin is largely lost in the scabbing which ensues, and nearly all of it fails to reach susceptible cells. The preparatory agents which increase the effectiveness of the virus bring about marked epidermal hyperplasia, and the hyperplastic tissue regenerates with greater rapidity when scarified. The agents evidently act in large part by providing young epidermal cells in quantity to the virus, as also by inducing a richer vascularization than ordinary in support of the papillomatous proliferation. It is possible that they also act by providing especially susceptible cells. The implications of the findings are discussed.	CELL STATE AS AFFECTING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A VIRUS ENHANCED EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RABBIT PAPILLOMA VIRUS ON HYPERPLASTIC EPIDERMIS	William F. Friedewald	19871177	1942-01-31	1	
By preliminary preparation of the skin in ways that render it hyperplastic the presence of infective virus can be demonstrated in extracts of domestic rabbit papillomas which yield no growths when inoculated by the ordinary methods and which for this reason have been supposed to contain no virus. The amount of virus recovered by the method outlined in the present work, however, is small when compared with the yield obtained in most instances from comparable cottontail rabbit papillomas. The yield is greatly influenced not only by the virus strain used to produce the growths but by the individual rabbit host. Although virus has been obtained from papillomas produced in domestic rabbits by all of the virus strains tested, a total of 21 thus far, only about one-fourth of these strains are readily to be procured again from the growths they cause and the others are demonstrable only in hosts in which the conditions are favorable for reasons unknown. An experimental comparison of the capacity of suspensions of papilloma tissue from domestic and cottontail rabbits to elicit specific antibodies has shown that the titers attained are approximately proportional to the amount of infective virus demonstrable in the suspensions. The findings as a whole indicate that far less virus exists in infective or antigenic form in the papillomas of domestic rabbits than in those of cottontail rabbits.

When pneumococci are grown repeatedly in broth containing immune serum or bile, they become less virulent and less type-specific. These changes are apparently due to the fact that under the conditions mentioned a number of organisms appear which have lost certain properties. These variant organisms form colonies differing in appearance from the colonies of the typical organisms, and cultures made from the atypical colonies are avirulent and are not type-specific, The degree of modification of the original culture is directly related to the relative number of organisms that have undergone variation. After prolonged growth in bile or homologous immune serum variation may have become manifest in all the bacteria of the cultures and the change is then irreversible. The significance of these findings as regards the epidemiology of pneumococcus infections is noted.	VARIATIONS IN SPECIFICITY AND VIRULENCE OF PNEUMOCOCCI DURING GROWTH IN VITRO	Hobart A.

1. Intact pneumococci, possessing specific antigenic powers unimpaired by cultural or other procedures, give rise to agglutinins for organisms of the homologous type and to precipitins for the type-specific carbohydrate derived from them. 2. Solutions of pneumococci free of all formed elements, but containing the carbohydrate and protein of the original cell, fail to stimulate the formation of type-specific antibodies. Sera prepared in this manner do not react with the carbohydrate constituent of the cell and do not agglutinate organisms of the homologous type. The loss of this antigenic function is related to changes incurred during dissolution of the bacterial cell. 3. Solutions of the cellular substances of Pneumococcus, although lacking the specific antigen of the whole cell, induce the formation of antibodies reactive with pneumococcus protein regardless of the type from which the latter is derived.

The data presented in this paper clearly indicate that the isolated carbohydrate and nucleoprotein constituents of Pneumococcus differ both serologically and antigenically one from the other. Moreover, each of these fractions of the cell separately exhibits immunological properties distinct from those manifested by the whole organism of which they form a part. The carbohydrate is a protein-free polysaccharide and as such is devoid of the property of stimulating antibodies. Although in the free state, dissociated from other cellular substances, it is non-antigenic, in this form it still retains the property of reacting specifically in anti-pneumococcus serum of the homologous type. Further, this nonprotein constituent is not reactive with antiprotein serum. In other words, neither pneumococcus carbohydrate nor protein as separate antigen gives rise to antibodies with specific affinities for the carbohydrate or so called soluble specific substance of Pneumococcus. The nucleoprotein of Pneumococcus, on the other hand, is antigenic. Immunization with this cell constituent gives rise to immune serum which precipitates solutions of pneumococcus protein without regard to the type from which it is derived. The interrelations of the carbohydrate and protein of Pneumococcus as they exist in the intact cell to form the complete antigen, and the interpretation of the differences in the antigenic properties of the whole bacterium as contrasted with those of its component parts are reserved for discussion in a subsequent paper.

To determine the nature of the organisms associated with outbreaks of rheumatism at The Pelham Home, in a large number of individuals at the Presbyterian Hospital Nurses' Training School and among rheumatic subjects in New York City under continuous clinical observation, studies of the throat flora have been conducted. Hemolytic streptococcus in most instances appeared in the pharynx from 1 to 5 weeks before the onset of the rheumatic attack. These organisms have been investigated with the usual types of bacteriological tests and, in addition, have been classified serologically according to Lancefield's technique. The results have demonstrated that the organisms were not of a single type, but fell into six antigenic groups. The majority of the freshly isolated strains tested were strong toxin producers. The organisms producing the strongest toxin were cultures from the patients who developed extremely intense rheumatism. About 70 per cent of these toxins were neutralized by a monovalent streptococcus antiserum.	STUDIES ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF STREPTOCOCCUS HEMOLYTICUS TO THE RHEUMATIC PROCESS II.

1. Anantiserum which specifically protects mice against a virulent culture (M variant) of the hemolytic streptococcus contains specific opsonin. Phagocytosis of the organisms can be observed in the peritoneum of the protected mouse. 2. An antiserum prepared by injecting an animal with the living M variant specifically opsonizes both the F and the M variant of the strain. 3. Evidence is presented which indicates the probable identity of the specific opsonin and the anti-M precipitin of Lancefield (7). Agglutination appears to be dependent upon a different antibody. 4. It is possible to type the hemolytic streptococci by means of specific opsonins, and the opsonic method has certain advantages over agglutination, precipitation, and mouse protection tests. It is evident from what little has been done that there are many types. 5. The serum of infants contains no opsonin for the virulent hemolytic streptococci, but the serum of adults may contain specific opsonins for certain strains. Inasmuch as no opsonins were demonstrable in two polyvalent antibacterial sera examined, the possibilities of therapeutic transfusion are discussed.

1. Among group B hemolytic streptococci one serological type previously described as homogeneous has been shown, instead, to contain two closely related types, distinguishable by reciprocal absorption experiments. These streptococci are designated Types Ia and Ib. 2. Homologous organisms in each case absorb all antibodies from their respective antisera, while organisms of the heterologous related type absorb only the antibody responsible for the cross reactions. Group B streptococci of other types do not absorb the antibodies responsible for the cross reactions between these two related types. The precipitin reaction and passive protection tests in mice were employed in this analysis. 3. The type-specific substance of Type Ia is a polysaccharide. Preliminary study indicates that this is also true of Type Ib. While no data are available concerning the chemical relationships of these substances, it seems probable that the two types elaborate polysaccharides, related chemically as well as serologically.

1. Four common variants of the hemolytic streptococcus of human origin have been described. These have been designated the F, M, attenuated M, and C variants. 2. The F and M variants only have been isolated from the blood stream in streptococcal infections. Only the M, however, has any primary virulence for the mouse. 3. Both these variants resist phagocytosis in human blood under suitable conditions, and this appears to be a reliable test for human virulence. 4. The attenuated M variant, found only in laboratory cultures, has a capsule as well developed as that of the virulent variants, and yet does not resist phagocytosis. 5. The C variant has no capsule and is readily phagocyted. It appears to correspond to the avirulent variant in other species. 6. An attempt has been made to correlate these four variants with those already described in the literature. 7. The application of these findings to the problem of virulence has been discussed.

In all instances in which reversion has occurred the ""R"" forms have invariably reverted to the same specific type from which they were originally derived. 3. The transformation ""R"" to ""S"" may be effected in vitro by growth in anti-""R"" sera, as well as in vivo by the method of animal passage. 4. Reversion from ""R"" to ""S"" whether effected in vivo or in vitro, is always accompanied by the acquisition of maximal virulence."

1. Heparin was more satisfactory for preventing blood from clotting than defibrination, potassium and ammonium oxalate, or sodium citrate in bacteriostasis of group A streptococci in the presence of streptococcal antibodies in convalescent serum. 2. Blood from rabbit, guinea pig, or sheep could not be substituted for human blood in promoting bacteriostasis when human antibody was used. Mixtures of human leukocytes and plasma of each of these animals or of animal leukocytes and human plasma were also not effective with human antibody. 3. Complement, leukocytes, and a thermostable factor which was found in human plasma were essential in the indirect bacteriostatic technique employed for the inhibition of streptococcal growth in the presence of convalescent human serum. 4. The thermostable component was active in human serum, as well as in plasma, in 1:12 dilution, withstood storage at 4° C. for at least 7 weeks, and was destroyed by heating at 70° C. for 30 minutes.

Five strains of encapsulated group A streptococci of different serological types, each with a glossy and a matt variant, were studied to compare the rôles of the M substance and the hyaluronic acid capsule in virulence of these microorganisms. The results indicated that both contribute to the virulence of group A streptococci but that the M antigen is the more fundamental factor. Encapsulated variants, both glossy and matt, were slightly less susceptible to phagocytosis than those from which the capsule had been removed with hyaluronidase. Glossy variants, containing no M substance, were readily phagocyted; matt, M-containing variants were resistant to phagocytosis except in the presence of anti-M serum when they became fully susceptible. Only the M-containing, matt strains were mouse-virulent. Mice were protected against infections with these strains: (a) By removal of the capsule with hyaluronidase, which resulted in slight protection, but only against 10 M.L.D. Early and intensive treatment was required to produce this effect; i.e., simultaneous injection of enzyme and streptococci followed by prolonged enzyme therapy. (b) By a single injection of anti-M serum administered the day before inoculation of the streptococci, which resulted in protection against 100,000 M.L.D. (c) By combined use of enzyme and anti-M serum, an additive effect of the two protective agents occurred, which resulted in protection against 1,000,000 M.L.D.

Considerable purification of streptolysin S has been achieved by fractionation of crude bacterial filtrates with methanol, under controlled conditions of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The final material (P III) consisted of two electrophoretic components. The purified material was employed for kinetic studies, the results of which were confirmed with hemolysin isolated electrophoretically from P III. The heat of activation (temperature characteristic) of streptolysin S was found to be 17,900 calories per mole. Time dilution curves of the hemolysin were found to be sigmoid. The influence of certain ions and lipids on the course of hemolysis was investigated. The significance of the prolonged lag period and of the deviation in the behavior of streptolysin S from Ponder's equation has been discussed.

The interaction of washed cocci, prepared under specified conditions, and a polynucleotide (AF) results in the formation of streptolysin S provided a fermentable carbohydrate is present. Maximum toxin formation requires, in addition, the presence of magnesium, potassium, and phosphate ions. Streptolysin S production proceeds anaerobically as well as aerobically but under the latter condition, apparently only if the system is sufficiently reducing. Temperature has a marked effect on the rate of appearance of toxin, the critical thermal increment having a value of approximately 36,000. The formation of streptolysin S is inhibited by mercuric ion, arsenite, iodoacetate, dinitrophenol, azide, and other enzyme poisons. The development of streptolysin S in resting cell systems depends neither upon autolysis nor upon physical extraction of preformed toxin but upon toxin synthesis. From the supernatant fluid of the resting cell system, a product containing 20,000 to 30,000 units of streptolysin S per mg. dry weight can be isolated. Information concerning the pH stability of the product is presented. The product is free of streptokinase, hyaluronidase, and proteinase, but possesses appreciable desoxyribonuclease activity. Chemical analyses and other findings indicate that polynucleotide and carbohydrate are present in major amount, and that a small but undetermined quantity of protein is present. Inactivation of streptolysin S by chymotrypsin, ficin, papain, or cathepsin, and not by a variety of other enzymes, indicates that protein is essential for activity, but the precise chemical composition of the toxin remains to be established.

A method was developed for the extraction of the group A streptococcus polysaccharide employing pepsin digestion of ground streptococcal cells. This method did not result in the isolation of polysaccharide with chemical and physical chemical properties different from those exhibited by preparations extracted with hot formamide. Studies of the chemical composition of this polysaccharide demonstrated it to be composed chiefly of rhamnose and glucosamine monosaccharide units in the approximate ratio of five moles of rhamnose to two moles of glucosamine. The fate of the polysaccharide after intravenous injection into mice was studied using the fluorescent antibody technique. It was found to be rapidly eliminated by the kidney. The presence of the polysaccharide in the renal tubular epithelial cells during the excretory phase was the only evidence of its cellular localization that could be detected under the conditions of these experiments.

All enzyme that destroys DPN has been found in fractionated and highly concentrated streptococcal preparations that also contain streptolysin O. The enzyme—streptococcal DPNase—was shown by electrophoretic separation and by other means to be distinct from streptolysin O. It is non-dialyzable, heat-labile, and has optimal activity in the pH range 7.2 to 7.8. The enzyme has a high degree of specificity for DPN, which it splits at the nicotinamide-ribose linkage.

Among 170 streptococcal strains, there were encountered 98 that yielded culture supernates which caused splitting of diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN). All of the latter belonged to Group A, C, or G. Release of DPNase accompanied the growth of diverse antigenic types of Group A streptococci, and data on the frequency of DPNase-producing strains for certain types are given. In contrast, cultures representing 3 species of yeasts and 42 species of bacteria other than streptococci of the Lancefield groups were examined for the presence of DPNase as an extracellular product of growth, but in none of these was the enzyme detected. Of the Group A streptococci examined, 41 strains had pedigrees suggesting that they were the etiologic agents of acute glomerulonephritis, and 39 of these were found to produce DPNase. There is an association between capacity of streptococi to form DPNase and capacity to kill leukocytes. A possible mechanism of leukotoxicity is suggested.

Group A streptococci were found to produce three different desoxyribonucleases, designated here as A, B, and C. These enzymes migrated separately on analysis with starch zone electrophoresis, were immunologically distinct, and showed certain differences in inhibition by citrate and in optimal pH of activity. The relative amount of each enzyme produced was a function of strain variation.	THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THREE DISTINCT DESOXYRIBONUCLEASES OF GROUP A STREPTOCOCCI	Lewis W.

Two strains of L forms of group A streptococci were examined for group-specific polysaccharide and found to lack this substance. One of these was found to make a substance that had several properties in common with M protein. It is suggested that the absence of the cell wall polysaccharide is responsible for the lack of rigidity of the L form and that the L form of this species closely resembles protoplasts as prepared from other species.

Under uniform diet conditions the normal bile fistula dog will eliminate pretty constant amounts of cholesterol—about 0.5 to 1.0 mg. cholesterol per kilo per 24 hours. Diets rich in cholesterol (egg yolk) will raise the cholesterol output in the bile but compared to the diet intake (1.5 gm. cholesterol) the output increase in the bile is trivial (5–15 mg.). Calves' brains in the diet are inert. Bile salt alone will raise the cholesterol output in the bile as much and often more than a cholesterol rich diet. Bile salt plus egg yolk plus whole bile give maximal output figures for bile cholesterol—60 mg. per 24 hours. Liver injury (chloroform) decreases both bile salt and cholesterol elimination in the bile. Blood destruction (hydrazine) fails to increase the bile cholesterol output and this eliminates the red cell stroma as an important contributing factor. Certain cholagogues (isatin and decholin) will increase the bile flow but cause no change in cholesterol elimination. The ratio of cholesterol to bile salt in the bile normally is about 1 to 100 but the bile salts are more labile in their fluctuations. The ratio is about reversed in the circulating blood plasma where the cholesterol is high (150–300 mg. per cent) and the bile salt concentration very low. Cholesterol runs so closely parallel to bile salt in the bile that one may feel confident of a physical relationship. In addition there is a suspicion that the bile cholesterol is in some obscure fashion linked with the physiological activity of hepatic epithelium.

Broth cultures of hemolytic streptococci derived from patients are capable of rapidly liquefying normal human fibrin clot. The active fibrinolytic principle is also contained in sterile, cell-free filtrates of broth cultures. The degree of activity of filtrates parallels the activity of whole broth cultures sufficiently closely to indicate that large amounts of the fibrinolytic substance are freely excreted into the surrounding medium and pass readily through Berkefeld V, Seitz, and Chamberland filters. The occurrence of fibrinolysis is most strikingly observed when plasma or fibrinogen is mixed with active cultural material before clot formation is effected. Under the standard experimental conditions described, complete dissolution of human plasma clot (whole oxalated plasma + CaCl2) occurs in about 10 minutes; complete dissolution of human fibrinogen clot (chemically isolated fibrinogen + thrombin) takes place in about 2 minutes. Titration of filtrate activity is recorded in Table IV. Twenty-eight strains of Streptococcus hemolyticus, isolated from patients suffering from various manifestations of streptococcus infection, have been tested for the capacity to liquefy fibrin clot. Broth cultures of all of the strains induced fibrinolysis. Of 18 strains of Streptococcus hemolyticus of animal origin, only three were capable of causing dissolution of clot. Completely negative results were obtained with 38 strains of other bacterial species. The list is presented on pages 492 and 493. The plasma of many patients recovered from acute hemolytic streptococcus infections, when clotted in the presence of active cultures, is highly resistant to fibrinolysis. Furthermore, serum, derived from patients whose plasma clot is resistant, often confers on normal plasma clot an antifibrinolytic property. One example of the resistance possessed by the blood of convalescent patients is presented in this report. A second paper, now in preparation, will give in detail a large number of observations on the relation of infection to the development of resistance to the fibrinolytic activity of hemolytic streptococci. In contrast to the susceptibility of normal human fibrin clot to liquefaction by active culture, normal rabbit fibrin clot is totally resistant to dissolution when tested under comparable conditions. The insusceptibility of rabbit fibrin clot is manifest provided the coagulum is composed of rabbit constituents. When human thrombin is used to clot rabbit plasma or fibrinogen in the presence of active cultures, fibrinolysis is not prohibited. The rôle of thrombin in determining the resistance or susceptibility of rabbit fibrin to dissolution offers a suggestive approach to problems relating to the underiving mechanism.

"1. The chemical and immunological characteristics of the species-specific substance (C) of Streptococcus hæmolyticus are considered. (a) It seems to be a carbohydrate because considerably purified preparations of C resisted prolonged tryptic and peptic digestion and were negative for the ordinary protein color tests but gave positive Molisch reactions to the limit of the precipitin titer. One such ""purified"" lot, however, had 4.2 per cent nitrogen and only 28 per cent reducing sugars on hydrolysis. Whether the nitrogen was due to impurities or was combined in the C substance itself, as is true of the Type I pneumococcus specific polysaccharide, cannot be stated without more material. (b) The C substance forms precipitates with antibacterial sera prepared against heterologous, as well as against homologous hemolytic streptococci. These precipitates are typical discs like those formed by type-specific carbohydrates of other species of bacteria. C does not precipitate antinucleoprotein sera. (c) While there is only slight direct evidence that the C substance is not antigenic, there is considerable indirect proof that this is the case. It probably is a haptene in the sense of Landsteiner. 2. A discussion is included of the chemical and immunological relationships of all the serologically active substances so far identified in extracts of the hemolytic streptococcus."

The anaphylactic reactions of two non-type-specific fractions of hemolytic streptococcus extracts parallel the precipitin reactions. The nucleoprotein, P, is a true antigen, in that it stimulates antibody production in rabbits, as shown before, and produces anaphylactic shock in guinea pigs actively as well as passively. The probable carbohydrate, C, on the other hand, does not induce antibody formation in rabbits, so far as known at present, but does produce typical anaphylactic shock in guinea pigs passively sensitized with antibacterial serum provided the serum shows a high titer of C precipitins. This is an instance of a hapten, probably carbohydrate in nature, causing anaphylactic shock in passively sensitized guinea pigs.	THE ANTIGENIC COMPLEX OF STREPTOCOCCUS HÆMOLYTICUS IV.

The virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis can be sedimented in the ultracentrifuge and washed repeatedly; the virus retains its activity provided that a small amount of normal serum is present in the diluent. A soluble substance capable of fixing complement in the presence of immune serum can be separated from the virus. Washed virus fixes complement poorly. The serologically specific soluble antigen is widely distributed in tissues of infected guinea pigs, mice, and monkeys.	A SOLUBLE ANTIGEN OF LYMPHOCYTIC CHORIOMENINGITIS I. SEPARATION OF SOLUBLE ANTIGEN FROM VIRUS	J. E. Smadel, R. D. Baird, M. J. Wall	19870890	1939-06-30	1	
The soluble antigen of lymphocytic choriomeningitis which is readily separable from the virus is a relatively stable substance and appears to be of a protein nature. A specific precipitin reaction can be demonstrated when immune serum is added to solutions of antigen which have been freed of certain serologically inactive substances. The complement-fixation and precipitation reactions which occur in the presence of immune serum and non-infectious extracts of splenic tissue obtained from guinea pigs moribund with lymphocytic choriomeningitis seem to be manifestations of union of the same soluble antigen and its antibody. On the other hand, the antisoluble substance antibodies and neutralizing substances appear to be different entities.	A SOLUBLE ANTIGEN OF LYMPHOCYTIC CHORIOMENINGITIS II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANTIGEN AND ITS USE IN PRECIPITIN REACTIONS	J. E. Smadel, M. J. Wall, R. D. Baird	19870943	1940-01-01	1	
Anti-soluble substance antibodies and neutralizing substances, which develop following infection with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, appear to be separate entities. The times of appearance and regression of the two antibodies are different in both man and the guinea pig; the antisoluble substance antibodies appear earlier and remain a shorter time. Moreover, mice develop them but no demonstrable neutralizing substances. Injection of formalin-treated, virus-free extracts containing considerable amounts of soluble antigen fails to elicit anti-soluble substance antibodies and to induce immunity in normal guinea pigs; administration of such preparations to immune pigs, however, is followed by a marked increase in the titer of anti-soluble substance antibodies in their serum. On the other hand, suspensions of formolized washed virus are effective in normal guinea pigs in stimulating both anti-soluble substance antibodies and protective substances, and in inducing immunity to infection.

"The composition of the insoluble ""integuments"" and soluble ""contents"" fractions of spores of four Bacillus species of widely differing heat resistance were compared. Electron microscopy of thin sections was also used to determine and compare the morphological structures in the integument preparations. The soluble fractions of the thermophiles, B. coagulans and B. stearothermophilus, had a higher content of hexose and dipicolinic acid. The hexose content of both fractions of the four species was related to heat resistance. Integument fractions consisted chiefly of protein together with variable amounts of the mucopeptide constituents, α, ε-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and hexosamine. In the thermophiles the DAP and hexosamine were found chiefly in the insoluble integuments fractions, while in B. cereus and B. subtilis most of this material was soluble. Integument preparations, containing mainly protein with little mucopeptide, consisted chiefly of outer and inner spore coats, while preparations having more mucopeptide contained also residual cortical material and a cortical membrane (possibly the germ cell wall). The results suggest that spore integuments consist of mainly proteinaceous outer and inner coats together with variable amounts of residual cortex and cortical membrane which contain the mucopeptide material."

The papillomas caused by the Shope virus sometimes grow down spontaneously into the subcutaneous tissue and extend along the lymphatics in the same way as do many cancers of the human breast. They may even invade the voluntary muscle under such circumstances, taking on an aspect suggestive of squamous cell carcinomatosis, but ultimately they differentiate in the way characteristic of the papilloma. Slight operative interferences with papillomas may be followed by a development of secondary nodules in the lungs. These result from cell emboli, and the same local conditions determine their fate as are effective in the case of emboli composed of human cancer cells. The virus-induced papilloma is not only a neoplasm in its immediate aspect and habit but sometimes one that verges upon malignancy. The tumors, including the cancers, which eventually derive from it in favorable hosts, are representative of more than a mere enhancement of the activity of the growth. They develop within a relatively brief period of time but only after the papilloma has grown for a long while; and they are morphologically various whereas the parent tumor is remarkably constant in its form. Some of the new growths differ but little from the papilloma, however, even when possessed of the ability to metastasize, and many continue to be influenced by the virus. The Shope virus is heavily conditioned in its carcinogenic activity, yet it is the nearest cause for cancer now known.	OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELATION OF THE VIRUS CAUSING RABBIT PAPILLOMAS TO THE CANCERS DERIVING THEREFROM II. THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY THE TUMORS: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS	Peyton Rous, J. W. Beard, John G. Kidd	19870544	1936-08-31	1	
All the strains of the Shope virus thus far tested which give rise to vigorous, progressively enlarging papillomas in domestic rabbits, function as carcinogenic agents by way of these growths. The more pathogenic the virus as evidenced by the brevity of its incubation period and the vigor of the papillomas produced, the sooner and oftener does cancer occur. The number of virus entities contained in the inoculum notably influences the outcome, cancer appearing most frequently in those confluent, papillomatous masses which have resulted from the greatest concentration of the virus material under test. The papillomas experimentally induced by the ordinary inoculation methods are essentially aggregates of proliferating cell families, each the outcome of some primary cell-virus association. Some of these associations are followed more frequently by cancer than others are in the same animal. Cottontail rabbits, the natural hosts of the virus, are notably resistant to its sustained activity, as compared with domestic rabbits. Though often growing rapidly at first, the papillomas of cottontails soon become relatively inert in most cases, and they usually retrogress, and rarely undergo malignant change. In an instance here reported both a squamous cell carcinoma and a metastasizing sarcoma appeared at the base of some papillomas due to experimental inoculation, which had existed on the ears of a cottontail for nearly 2 years. The meaning of the phenomena is discussed.	OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELATION OF THE VIRUS CAUSING RABBIT PAPILLOMAS TO THE CANCERS DERIVING THEREFROM I.

A carcinogenic tar applied to rabbit skin renders many more epidermal cells neoplastic than ever declare themselves by forming tumors. They may be present in large numbers and persist for a considerable time after brief tarring, yet give rise to no growths unless encouraged. The stimulus of wound healing will suffice to make some of them multiply and form tumors. No evidence has been obtained, in experiments specifically directed to the point, that the cells which tar renders neoplastic respond in this way because they are possessed of peculiarities not shared by the rest of the normal epithelium. The fact that non-specific stimulation (as e.g. wound healing) may act as the deciding influence in tumor formation brings out the need for a sharp distinction between the forces which induce neoplastic change and those which determine, or prevent, its realization in terms of a tumor. The distinction is vital to the appraisal of the many carcinogenic substances worked with nowadays. The ability of tumor cells to lie latent for long periods and respond to non-carcinogenic stimulation by multiplying into growths provides an explanation of those clinical instances in which cancer appears rapidly after acute injury to tissue that had seemed normal.	THE EXPERIMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF LATENT NEOPLASTIC CHANGES IN TARRED SKIN	Ian MacKenzie, Peyton Rous	19871085	1941-02-28	1	
A squamous cell carcinoma derived from a virus-induced rabbit papilloma has been propagated in fourteen successive groups of animals. It grows rapidly now in most individuals to which it is transplanted, killing early and metastasizing frequently. The original cancer was the outcome of alterations in epidermal cells already rendered neoplastic by the virus, and the latter, or an agent nearly related to it, has persisted and increased in the malignant tissue, as a study of the blood of the first ten groups of cancerous animals has shown. An antibody capable of specifically neutralizing the virus in vitro appeared in the blood of every new host in which the tumor enlarged progressively, and reached a titer comparable with that obtaining in animals which had long carried large papillomas. The antibody was absent from normal rabbits and those in which the cancer failed to grow. The implications of these facts are considered.	A TRANSPLANTABLE RABBIT CARCINOMA ORIGINATING IN A VIRUS-INDUCED PAPILLOMA AND CONTAINING THE VIRUS IN MASKED OR ALTERED FORM	John G. Kidd, Peyton Rous	19871000	1940-05-31	1	
The papillomas induced in domestic rabbits with virus procured from cottontails undergo progressive changes in the direction of malignancy when they grow vigorously. From the beginning they exhibit the traits whereby tumors are characterized, and they have malignant potentialities. In seven animals of a group of ten carrying papillomas for more than 200 days, cancer has developed, and in an eighth a tumor of problematic malignancy has arisen. One of the remaining two rabbits died early in the cancer period, and the papillomas of the other eventually retrogressed. Ten cottontails with induced growths of much longer duration have not developed cancer. The malignant tumors have all been acanthomatous in type, and have arisen directly from the papillomas by graded, continuous alterations. These have often gone further after malignancy has been attained, and have eventuated in great anaplasia. Metastasis has been frequent, and transplantation to another host has proved successful. Individual growths have occurred expressive of each stage of the transformation to cancer, as if through a stabilization at this stage; yet despite the variety thus afforded, the tumors must all be looked upon as the consequence of alterations in cells of a single sort, namely epidermal cells affected by the virus, and the alterations themselves have taken a single direction. In the morphology of many of the cancers the influence of the virus is still manifest. The better the papilloma grew, the more likely was cancer to occur, and the greater was the tendency to multiple tumors. In the most favorable rabbits malignant changes took place at numerous locations in the papillomatous tissue, and were imminent at many others. Intercurrent factors had much to do with determining frank carcinosis; and when the tendency to it was not marked their influence sometimes seemed crucial. Analogous instances of a graded alteration from papilloma to cancer are frequent in human pathology. The virus that gives rise to the rabbit papillomas must be looked upon as the primary cause of the cancers developing therefrom. Whether it is their proximate cause has yet to be determined.

The Shope papilloma virus elicits carcinomas forthwith, as well as papillomas in great variety, when it is distributed by way of the blood stream to the tarred epidermis of domestic rabbits. The phenomenon will be analyzed in succeeding papers with the aid of additional instances.	THE CARCINOGENIC EFFECT OF A PAPILLOMA VIRUS ON THE TARRED SKIN OF RABBITS I. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON	Peyton Rous, John G. Kidd	19870729	1938-02-28	1	
The naturally occurring virus papillomas of western cottontail rabbits become malignant occasionally. The cancers derive from the papilloma cells, that is to say from elements already rendered neoplastic by the virus and still infected therewith. Papillomas produced with the virus in jack rabbits and snowshoe rabbits become cancerous in the same way but much more frequently, as is the case in domestic rabbits also. To all three species the virus is foreign. The character of the cancers of the wild rabbits is described and the relation of the virus to them discussed on the basis of experimental findings. The facts support the view that the cancers result from virus variation, this in many instances being but slight.	CANCERS DERIVING FROM THE VIRUS PAPILLOMAS OF WILD RABBITS UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS	John G. Kidd, Peyton Rous	19870976	1940-03-31	1	
"The foregoing experiments have shown that the causative virus is usually ""masked"" in the large, disorderly, fissured and inflamed papillomas of cottontails when antiviral antibody is present in quantity in their blood, though virus can be recovered as a rule from the smaller, discrete, well ordered papillomas of these rabbits, almost irrespective of the amount of antibody in the blood of the individuals bearing them. Other findings are described which indicate that the masking of the virus in the large fissured growths is due to serum antibody present in them as result of exudation or hemorrhage, which neutralizes the virus when the growths are extracted or preserved in vitro. The local conditions that favor extravasation of serum (and the accumulation of antibody) prevail as a rule in the large, confluent growths arising after virus has been sown broadcast on scarified skin, but to lesser extent or not at all in the discrete papillomas that occur naturally or as result of tattoo inoculation. The state of affairs is notably different in the papillomas of domestic rabbits. The virus is regularly masked in these, and usually masked completely, even when there is little antibody in the blood and the local conditions do not favor its extravasation into the growths. The findings indicate that something other than antibody is primarily responsible for the masking in this species."

The serum of a rabbit with large cancers resulting from the transplantation of a squamous cell carcinoma that had arisen from a virusinduced papilloma, possessed the power to neutralize the virus, and so too in less degree did that of an animal of the same transplantation series in which a small nodule had developed. The sera of rabbits carrying tar papillomas or the Brown-Pearce carcinoma proved wholly devoid of effect on the virus. The implantation of Brown-Pearce tumor material mixed with virus did not lead to an enduring establishment of the latter in the resulting growths, nor to any immediate changes in their morphological character. The significance of the facts is discussed.	SEROLOGICAL REACTIONS WITH A VIRUS CAUSING RABBIT PAPILLOMAS WHICH BECOME CANCEROUS II.

A method has been devised for serological tests with a virus producing rabbit papillomas that become carcinomatous. The discrete character of the growths caused by the virus when suitably diluted fits it notably for quantitative experimentation. It shows no tendency to lie latent in domestic rabbits though it does so on occasion in cottontails, the natural hosts. Sera which partially neutralize it do not alter its character, or attenuate it, but merely cut down the number of its effective entities. The serum of normal domestic rabbits is ordinarily devoid of neutralizing influence on the virus, but that of animals carrying the papillomas usually exhibits neutralizing power soon after these appear. The rate at which this power increases depends in general upon the amount of papillomatous tissue developing, but exceptions to the rule occur, the presence of fairly large growths being compatible with a lack of such powers in demonstrable amount. Even when the antiviral power is great it has no evident influence on the course of established papillomas, other factors determining whether these enlarge or retrogress. It acts to prevent successful reinoculation of the animal, however.	SEROLOGICAL REACTIONS WITH A VIRUS CAUSING RABBIT PAPILLOMAS WHICH BECOME CANCEROUS I.

A strain of rabbit fibroma virus (changed virus) producing partly fibromatous, partly inflammatory, lesions is believed to represent a mixture of the original virus with a strain (inflammatory virus) causing only necrotic and inflammatory lesions. The inflammatory virus does not represent a contamination from without, but probably arose as a mutant from the original strain. The occurrence of mutation amongst viruses and the propriety of using the word in this field are briefly discussed. Consideration is also given to the nature of the change in the virus which leads to a tissue reaction so widely different from that produced by the original strain.	A CHANGE IN RABBIT FIBROMA VIRUS SUGGESTING MUTATION III. INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS	C. H. Andrewes, R. E. Shope	19870465	1936-01-31	1	
A strain of rabbit fibroma is described causing in inoculated animals acute inflammatory lesions very different from the fibroma-like growths induced by the original strain. The new inflammatory strain cross-immunised with the normal strain but not with various other viruses. Efforts at changing one strain into the other were unsuccessful. Another, referred to as the changed, strain produced lesions of mixed character, partly inflammatory, partly fibromatous; it continued to behave in this way through numerous passages. An artificial mixture of inflammatory and fibromatous viruses behaved in all respects like the changed strain. Discussion of the significance of the findings is reserved for a separate paper (3) where the facts can be considered in relation to those described by Shope (2).

1. By means of cataphoresis vaccine virus can be obtained from suspensions of tissue which are inactive by the usual tests of animal inoculation. 2. Active virus can be obtained by cataphoresis from the tissues of rabbits long recovered from the effects of cutaneous vaccination. 3. Evidence is brought forward which suggests that immunity in a virus disease, such as vaccinia, may be linked with the persistence in the body of living virus.

An experimental analysis of the factors responsible for the observed differences in the course of virus-induced papillomas of the rabbit has shown that some are referable to the virus, others to the cells, and yet others to host influences. The interplay of these factors affords enlightening illustration of the nature of the cell-virus relationship in virus-induced tumors. Retrogression of the rabbit papillomas appears to be consequent on a generalized resistance of host origin, elicited by and directed against the proliferating, virus-infected cells.	THE COURSE OF VIRUS-INDUCED RABBIT PAPILLOMAS AS DETERMINED BY VIRUS, CELLS, AND HOST	John G. Kidd	19870740	1938-03-31	1	
Experimental study of the rabbit papilloma of Shope, a growth caused by a virus, has shown that it possesses the immediate characters whereby tumors are recognized. Often it looks and acts like a malignant neoplasm. It differs from the tumors as a group, however, in its incidence which is that of an infectious process, and from other mammalian tumors in that its cause has been demonstrated. The possible bearing of the findings upon the problem of tumor causation is discussed. The morphology and behavior of the generality of tumors can no longer be taken to exclude the possibility that these are produced by extraneous, living entities. The incidence of some of the tumors at least, and the failure to demonstrate their cause can both be explained on the assumption that they are due to such entities, widely distributed in or upon the animal population but effective only under special circumstances. Present knowledge makes this assumption reasonable as a basis for further work.	A VIRUS-INDUCED MAMMALIAN GROWTH WITH THE CHARACTERS OF A TUMOR (THE SHOPE RABBIT PAPILLOMA) III.

Benzpyrene brings about neoplastic changes in rabbit epidermis much sooner than has been supposed. The long interval that elapses before visible growths appear is due in the main to the relatively slight power of the carcinogen to encourage multiplication of the cells it renders neoplastic. Yet some slight power of this sort it has. Methylcholanthrene has somewhat more but not nearly so much as tar. It may initiate neoplastic changes within less than 17 days, as compared with less than 10 days for tar, but tumors due to it do not ordinarily appear until months after those called forth by tarring. All three agents give rise to growths of essentially the same kinds, but most of those due to benzpyrene and methlycholanthrene remain for a long while small, dry, and indolent whereas many of the tar tumors are fleshy, vigorous, and rapidly enlarging,—differences wholly consequent on differences in the ability to promote growth. Such ability is an important element in the effectiveness of carcinogens. Tar and the polycyclic hydrocarbons cause many more cells to become tumor cells than give rise to visible growths. Benzpyrene is as effective in initiating neoplastic changes when dissolved in mineral oil as when in benzene, yet no tumors result from it until months after the benzene solution has given rise to them, the reason being that when in oil it is almost devoid of influence to encourage cell proliferation. Benzene itself has a very slight influence of the sort. Solvents may determine not only whether carcinogens initiate neoplastic change but may condition to a crucial degree the influence of these agents to encourage tumor formation. Rabbit epidermis is much more responsive to carcinogenic influences than that of the mouse, as measured in terms of time taken to elicit benign neoplasms. Even benzene will call forth these growths from rabbit skin. In appraising the relative responsiveness to carcinogens of various animal species it is essential to reckon in terms of cells of identical type.

Two intraperitoneal injections of either infectious or non-infectious rabbit papilloma suspensions actively immunize rabbits against papillomatosis. The capacity of the non-infectious suspensions to immunize is considered as evidence that they contain papilloma virus even though none can be demonstrated by the usual infection test.

"A study has been made of the yield of virus and of the complement-binding antigen from the virus-induced papillomas of cottontail and domestic rabbits. Extracts of the discrete, naturally occurring papillomas of cottontail rabbits usually contain virus in large amount; and, as a rule, they also contain the complement-binding antigen in high titer. The confluent growths produced experimentally with the virus in some cottontails, on the other hand, often fail to yield the virus, or furnish it in small amount; and extracts of them have little if any complement-binding capacity. The sera of cottontails with massive papillomas from which the virus cannot be recovered often have high antibody titers. Many extracts were tested of the virus-induced papillomas of domestic rabbits. None contained the virus in large amount, and the majority of them failed to manifest it on sensitive test. A few fixed complement in low titer when mixed with immune sera, but most failed to do so. Crude extracts of the ""non-infectious,"" virus-induced papillomas of domestic rabbits stimulated the formation of virus-neutralizing and complement-binding antibodies in low titer when injected intraperitoneally into normal rabbits of the same breed, but Berkefeld filtrates of the same materials proved devoid of this immunizing effect. The significance of the findings described in the three papers is discussed. The evidence as a whole favors the view that the virus stimulates the formation of the virus-neutralizing and complement-binding antibodies in vivo, and many facts indicate that it is closely associated, and in all probability identical, with the antigen that reacts with immune serum to fix complement in vitro."

"The ""inhibitor"" demonstrable in extracts of the virus-induced rabbit papillomas is identical with the antiviral antibody found in the blood of hosts bearing the growths. The conditions in these latter are frequently favorable to its extravasation in considerable amount into them.

Experiments are described which show that the rabbit papilloma virus elicits an antibody of one type only, this being capable both of neutralizing the virus and of fixing complement in mixture with it. The virus and its antibody have a powerful, specific affinity for one another, each being capable of absorbing the other in great excess when they are brought together in the test tube. The union formed by them in vitro cannot be dissociated in any demonstrable degree by dilution or centrifugation. In many respects the findings differ from those with most viruses previously studied.	UNION IN VITRO OF THE PAPILLOMA VIRUS AND ITS ANTIBODY	William F. Friedewald, John G. Kidd	19871042	1940-10-31	1	
"A study has been made of the immunization procedure described by Shope, with particular reference to the detection of ""masked"" papilloma virus by means of it. Papilloma extracts were frequently encountered which, though non-pathogenic, elicited the specific antiviral antibody and induced resistance to the virus upon injection intraperitoneally into normal rabbits. The results of the immunization experiments were often complicated, however, by the effects of extravasated antibody, which had accumulated in various amounts in many of the papillomas and was consequently present in extracts of them together with ""masked"" virus. The extravasated antibody was often sufficient to render extracts of domestic rabbit papillomas non-antigenic; and sometimes, when present in excess, its passive transfer conferred resistance to reinfection with the virus. The conclusion seems warranted that only positive immunization findings can be interpreted with certainty. Negative results provide no decisive evidence as to whether ""masked"" virus is or is not present in the injected material, unless the amount of extravasated antibody also present is known. The findings may have a bearing on the negative outcome of immunization experiments with extracts of the cancers deriving from the natural papillomas of cottontails. Crude suspensions of domestic rabbit papillomas, which contain little or no virus demonstrable by ordinary methods, are far less antigenic than extracts of the natural growths of wild rabbits, which contain virus in quantity. In explanation of the finding the possibility seems worthy of attention that domestic rabbit papillomas may contain much less virus than the growths of cotton tails, the natural hosts of the virus."

1. A highly virulent strain of pneumococcus, Type I, Neufeld, when grown in an automatic transferring device at 2 hour intervals on different lots of plain broth adjusted respectively to pH = 6.5, 7, 7.5, or 7.8, lost its virulence at a rate in direct ratio to the H ion concentration of the media—the more acid the media, the more rapid the decrease. 2. Growth of a virulent pneumococcus upon plain broth of an H ion concentration changing gradually either to the acid or the alkaline side of neutrality was accompanied by an initial rise in virulence with a subsequent fall, the change being more rapid in the alkaline than in the acid medium. The organism under these conditions underwent an alteration in its behavior toward agglutinating sera; although still specific, its agglutinability became much greater than that of the original organism. This change was more pronounced in the alkaline than in the acid medium. 3. The virulence of a relatively virulent culture of a pneumococcus grown on plain broth underwent different alterations when the organism was transferred at intervals of 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. With the 1 hour interval, there occurred seemingly an immediate decrease in virulence, while at intervals of 2, 4, and 8 hours, there occurred first a rise and then a fall, the rise being greatest with the 8 hour interval of transfer and least with the 2 hour. 4. Meat infusion adjusted to various H ion concentrations—pH = 7, 7.3, and 7.7—and made with different amounts of meat furnished conditions which caused a decrease in virulence, the unfavorable action varying in inverse proportion to the concentration of the infusion. Dextrose added to both plain broth and to meat infusion neutralized to a marked degree the unfavorable action of these media. 5. The growth of pneumococci on the different ingredients of plain broth, with plain broth made from the same supply as a control, revealed the fact that peptone in 2 per cent solution maintained and even increased the virulence of the strain of pneumococcus studied, while meat infusion caused the usual decrease. The rate of decrease with plain broth was slower than with meat infusion, showing that the 2 per cent peptone neutralized to some extent the unfavorable action of the infusion.

1. Refinements in the methods for the isolation of the soluble specific substances of Types II and III pneumococcus are described. These improvements have resulted in the isolation of the end-products in a form free from nitrogen and of enhanced activity with immune serum. 2. The soluble specific substance of Type I pneumococcus is described and shown to differ sharply from the corresponding substances of the other two types, each of which, in turn, differs from the other. 3. Progress is reported on the identification of the sugar units from which the polysaccharides are built up. 4. The evidence so far accumulated is believed to favor strongly the view that the polysaccharides isolated are the actual specific substances of Pneumococcus.

"1. In normal unheated human serum, virulent pneumococci may be prepared for phagocytosis by two separate antibodies, acting in conjunction with complement. One of these is the type-specific anticarbohydrate antibody reacting with the carbohydrate fraction of the pneumococcus. The other is probably also a type-specific antibody, but quite distinct from the former, and therefore must react with a different antigenic constituent of the bacterium. 2. In the normal human serum heated to 56°C., these two antibodies may, after prolonged contact with the organism, promote phagocytosis of the pneumococcus without the adjuvant action of complement. 3. Although these two antibodies are equally effective in the phagocytosis of 24 hour culture organisms by normal blood, the anticarbohydrate antibody tends to become the predominant factor as the pneumococci approach the state in which they exist in the animal body. 4. In so far as we have been able to show, the anticarbohydrate antibody is the only antibody in immune serum which can induce phagocytosis. This substance by itself is active in a phagocytic system, but just as in the normal serum, complement enhances its effect. The failure to demonstrate the presence in the immune serum of an antibody, distinct from the anticarbohydrate antibody, analogous to that found in the normal serum, may be due to the experimental difficulty of removing all the anticarbohydrate antibody from a concentrated immune serum. 5. Thus it is seen that a single well defined antibody (the anticarbohydrate antibody) may be responsible for the phagocytic action of normal unheated serum, normal heated serum, inactivated immune serum, and immune serum activated by complement. These facts appear to us to invalidate Neufeld's division of the phagocytic antibodies into (a) bacteriotropins (antibodies, the phagocytic titre of which is not raised by the addition of complement); (b) opsonic antibodies (antibodies, comparable to the lysins, which are only active in the presence of complement). 6. Complement alone is incapable of inducing phagocytosis of the pneumococcus. In the phagocytic process, it appears simply to increase the speed at which the reaction takes place. Its role may be compared to that of a catalyst in a chemical reaction. 7. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that the term ""tropin"" be discarded as misleading and unnecessary, and that the term ""opsonin"" be retained to denote any heat-stable antibody which prepares bacteria for phagocytosis. Contrary to current usage, it would not suggest a combination of antibody with complement."

The pneumococci hitherto known as Group IV have been separated into ten types which have been designated by Roman numerals from IV to XIII. These have been correlated as far as possible with the types described by others. The prevalence and mortality of cases due to each type have been estimated in the limited number of cases studied. Laboratory tests indicated that therapeutic antiserums for Types I, II and III have very little protective power against the recently separated types. Monovalent antiserums of high agglutinative and protective power were prepared in rabbits for each type. Several monovalent antiserums each specific for a type, which are suitable for agglutination and experimental therapeutic use, have been obtained by immunizing horses. An antiserum prepared for one type had very little cross-protective power against other types.

The paper reports an experimental comparison of the antibody responses of mice and of rabbits to immunization with typical Type III pneumococci and a strain related to Type III. The results as a whole show that the relative antigenic effectiveness of these two kinds of related pneumococci, is different in different animals. In rabbits the strain related to but not identical with Type III elicits the better response; in mice, the typical Type III strain is more effective. These relationships furnish an example of the influence of the species of animal upon the effectiveness of even closely related bacterial antigens.

"The paper reports a study of a virulent, S-producing strain of Pneumococcus which is immunologically related to, but not identical with typical strains of Type III pneumococcus. In a potent anti-Type III serum, the relationship of this strain to typical Type III strains appears to be about the same as the relationship of Avery's Subgroup Type II strains to typical Type II. But a more pronounced distinction is evident in the antiserum produced by immunization with the strain related to Type III. This antiserum contained antobodies specifically reactive with typical Type III bacteria as well as antibodies reactive with the homologous strain, while anti-Subgroup Type II immune sera are devoid of antibodies reactive with typical Type II pneumococci. The result of absorption experiments were the same as those usually obtained with immunologically related, but not identical bacteria. The failure of reciprocal absorption and the marked variations in the relative potencies of the antiserum from different individual animals might be presented as presumptive evidence that two different anti-S antibodies are contained in Type III immune horse serum. The theoretical significance of virulent pneumococci which are related to but not identical with the ""fixed"" types, is discussed from the standpoint of their importance in the biological classification of the Pneumococcus group."

This paper reports inter-reactions of anaphylaxis and precipitation between antigens and antisera derived from the Type II variety of pneumococcus and from one variety of yeast. That the reactions occurred only with Type II and not with Types I and III is proof that the pneumococcus antigen responsible for the anaphylaxis of the antiyeast sensitized animals was the type-specific carbohydrate (S). Pronounced differences in respect to reactivity with the pneumococcus antigen were found between individual antiyeast sera that were of equal potency in respect to reactivity with the yeast antigen. This fact emphasizes the desirability of the use of antisera from a large number of individual animals in the study of microbial inter-relationships.

1. A relationship between the soluble specific substances of pneumococci and the blood group substance A of man can be demonstrated by the inhibition of sheep cell hemolysis by a group specific A-antiserum. However, there are quantitative differences between the various types. 2. A striking difference exists between the acetyl and the de-acetylated polysaccharide of Pneumococcus Type I: The de-acetylated carbohydrate fails to react with the group specific A-antiserum, while the acetyl carbohydrate shows a strong reactivity. 3. The minimum amount of the acetyl polysaccharide, which inhibits sheep cell hemolysis by A-antiserum, is almost as small as that of the group specific carbohydrate isolated by Freudenberg and Eichel from urines of group A. 4. The reactivity of the acetyl polysaccharide can be demonstrated not only by the hemolysis inhibition test, but also by complement fixation and by inhibition of group specific iso-agglutination. 5. Feces filtrates, which possess the ability to destroy the blood group specific substances A and B of man, also affect the acetyl polysaccharide of Pneumococcus Type I. After incubation with an effective feces filtrate, the acetyl polysaccharide almost completely loses its potency toward the group specific A-antiserum and also its ability to inhibit the iso-agglutination of A blood cells. 6. Acetyl polysaccharide of Pneumococcus Type I, having lost its reactivity toward the group-specific A-antiserum after treatment with feces filtrate, still reacts with Type I pneumococcus antiserum which was previously absorbed with de-acetylated polysaccharide, Type I. Thus, the essential effect of the feces filtrate on acetyl polysaccharide, Type I, is not the cleavage of acetyl group, but some other chemical alteration.

The precipitin reaction between the specific polysaccharide of Type III pneumococcus and homologous antibody formed in the horse can be accounted for quantitatively by assuming the chemical combination of the components in a bimolecular reaction, followed by a series of competing bimolecular reactions which depend upon the relative proportions of the components. These reactions would lead to the formation of larger and larger aggregates until precipitation ultimately occurred. The mathematical formulation of this theory on the basis of the mass law is described. The derived expressions are shown to be in accord with the experimental findings and the constants used in these expressions are shown to have definite significance. In spite of the wide variation in the properties of individual sera these expressions permit the complete description of the behavior of an unknown serum with S III without an unduly burdensome number of analyses. The quantitative theory presented has been found applicable to other instances of the precipitin reaction, as will be shown in subsequent papers.

Kendall	19870380	1935-03-31	1	
The soluble specific substance of Pneumococcus Type I has been chemically isolated from the bacterial cells and from autolyzed cultures as an acetyl polysaccharide. So far as could be determined by the methods employed, the acetyl polysaccharide in highly purified form absorbs from Type I antipneumococcus serum all demonstrable type-specific precipitins, agglutinins and protective antibodies. Mice injected intraperitoneally with minute quantities of the acetyl polysaccharide develop active immunity to subsequent infection with Pneumococcus Type I. The immunity thus induced is type-specific. In several instances purpura has been observed in mice following the injection of larger amounts of the acetyl polysaccharide. Under the experimental conditions of this study, no type-specific precipitins, agglutinins or protective antibodies were demonstrable in the serum of rabbits following repeated intravenous injections of the Type I acetyl polysaccharide. The treated rabbits were not immune to subsequent infection with Pnemnococcus Type I. The acetyl polysaccharide is readily converted into its deacetylated derivative by treatment with dilute alkali. The chemical and immunological properties of the deacetylated polysaccharide are identical with those of the soluble specific substance in the chemical form in which it was originally isolated; the deacetylated form of the specific carbohydrate is non-antigenic, does not produce purpura in mice, and only incompletely absorbs the type-specific antibodies from Type I antipneumococcus serum. The immunological significance of the acetyl polysaccharide and its possible relationship to the specific substances isolated from Pneumococcus Type I by other workers are discussed.

Mice vaccinated with yeast were protected against subsequent infection with Type II pneumococci, but not against Types I or III. While the protection was not universal, as high a percentage of mice acquired active anti-Type II immunity, as was obtained by vaccination of another group of mice with Type II pneumococci themselves. This specific protection of mice by active immunization with the yeast antigen, is probably due to the same immunological relationship responsible for the anti-Type II reactivity of the antisera of rabbits immunized with yeast antigen.

1. By partial acid hydrolysis a specific carbohydrate may be isolated from gum arabic (gum acacia). This carbohydrate is comparable in its precipitating activity for Type II (and Type III) antipneumococcus serum with the bacterial soluble specific substances themselves. 2. On hydrolysis this fraction yields galactose and two or more complex sugar acids, one of which appears to be a disaccharide add comparable with those isolated from the specific polysaccharides of the Type III pneumococcus and the Type A Friedländer bacillus. 3.

The alcohol-insoluble polysaccharides of gonococcus and meningococcus were found to contain 4.2 and 3.7 per cent nitrogen respectively, to be protein-free by chemical test, to reduce FehIing-Benedict solution only after hydrolysis. They were non-toxic for rabbits and mice, and failed to engender antibodies (precipitins) in rabbits. They produced no cutaneous reactions in normal, snuffle-free rabbits, but caused typical allergic reactions of the delayed type in rabbits rendered hypersensitive to these organisms. Both carbohydrates reacted in high dilution with Antipneumococcus Serum Type III. For comparison, carbohydrates were prepared also from Micrococcus catarrhalis, Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and a rough strain of pneumococcus.

An encapsulated strain of Escherichia coli has been isolated which is hemolytic, pathogenic for mice, and which has served to illustrate further evidence of heterogenetic specificity. The relationship appears to be limited to the serological reactions between the colon organism and Type I antipneumococcic horse serum. Type I antipneumococcic rabbit serum failed to agglutinate the organism and no reactions occurred with Types II and III antipneumococcic horse serums, normal horse serum, and a variety of other immune horse serums. Serum from rabbits immunized with the colon bacillus agglutinated the homologous organism and precipitated its soluble substance, but failed to cause agglutination of Type I pneumococci or to precipitate Type I pneumococcic polysaccharide. The evidence indicates a connection somewhat analogous to that between Type II pneumococcus and Type B Friedländer's bacillus.

1. Menkin's observations of the failure of inflammatory fixation in areas of acute inflammation due to Streptococcus haemolyticus have been confirmed. 2. The lack of inflammatory fixation in the presence of streptococci is not due to the passive nature of the streptococcus, but may be attributed to the production of (1) fibrinolytic, and (2) antifibrinogenic substances which dissolve the fibrin barrier, or prevent its formation, thus maintaining the patency of the lymphatics and capillaries and facilitating the dissemination of the organisms. 3. The production of fibrinolytic or antifibrinogenic substances, and the invasiveness of a given strain of streptococcus are correlative. 4. Both substances are relatively thermostable. Fibrinolysin is destroyed if held at 100°C. for 1 hour. The antifibrinogenic substance is weakened but is not destroyed under the same conditions. 5. There is evidence that both substances are antigenic, and exhibit some degree of type specificity. 6. The role of fibrinolysin and the antifibrinogenic factor in the invasion of the tissues by streptococci is discussed.	A STUDY ON THE MECHANISM OF INVASIVENESS OF STREPTOCOCCI	Emery Westervelt Dennis, Dicran Berberian	19870324	1934-10-31	1	
1. An automatic apparatus is described by which a new supply of food can be furnished actively growing organisms at any desired interval of time—an automatic transferring device. 2. A single strain of pneumococcus, Type I, Neufeld, which had become avirulent for mice, acquired virulence of maximal degree when grown in the described apparatus with skimmed milk sterilized in an Arnold sterilizer as the medium. Transfers were made at intervals of 2, 4, and 8 hours. It is difficult to determine the best interval of transfer, but the 8 hour interval apparently is most suitable, with the 4 and 2 hour following in preference in the order named. 3. Pasteurized skimmed milk from a single dairy, but obtained on different days, when used as medium at a 2 hour interval, varied in effect on the virulence of pneumococci, the results showing that the virulence might be either increased, decreased, or maintained. 4. Skimmed milk heated for varying lengths of time, 30 minutes at 17 pounds pressure, or 60 or 90 minutes at the same pressure, lost its suitability for maintaining virulence of a pneumococcus when transferred every 2 hours, the effect being in direct proportion to the length of time the milk was heated. 5. The H ion concentration of milk had slight effect on virulence. A virulent strain of pneumococcus was grown in milk adjusted to pH = 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, transfers being made every 2 hours. Virulence was maintained to a like degree on milk titrated to pH = 5, 6, and 7, but when the organism was grown in milk of pH = 8 and 9, virulence decreased, more rapidly at pH = 9 than at pH = 8. 6. A pure line practically avirulent strain of pneumococcus picked by the Barber method, when grown in milk at a 4 hour interval of transfer, increased in virulence 10 million fold; that is to say, until one diplococcus would kill a mouse. Prior to this study, no record has been found in which the virulence of any microorganism has been increased to such a degree by an in vitro method.	STUDIES ON VIRULENCE II.

1. Immune sera prepared with the degraded or variant forms of pneumococci (R strains) are similar in their reactions to sera prepared with the protein or cell solutions of pneumococci. They contain antibodies reactive with the protein of all types of pneumococci, but no antibodies reactive with the type-specific substances. 2. Pneumococci of the variant or R form, regardless of type derivation, are serologically identical and have the antigenic characteristics of pneumococcus protein. They evoke the species-specific and not the type-specific antibodies. 3. Antipneumococcus sera obtained by immunization with S strains may contain species-specific antibodies in addition to those which are type-specific. Each kind of antibody can be removed separately from these sera by selective absorption with the R or S strains of pneumococci.

1. Type-specific M extracts and group-specific C carbohydrate of group A streptococci inhibited bacteriostasis of these microorganisms in the presence of normal whole blood and of sera from patients convalescent from streptococcal infections. The inhibition was not specific with respect to streptococcal types and depended merely on the formation of precipitates in the system. The extracts had no antagonistic action in themselves. 2. Preformed precipitates derived from the interaction of an antigen and its homologous antibody or from finely divided coagulated particles of human plasma or ascitic fluid also interfered with the bacteriostasis. The supernatant fluid in which one of these precipitates was formed did not inhibit bacteriostatic activity; therefore, it seems that other possible products of the antigen-antibody reaction were not inhibitory. The relative size of the precipitate particles was a conditioning factor since small particles of one precipitate inhibited bacteriostasis, but large ones of the same precipitate failed to do so. 3. Stained films of blood cells treated with antigen-antibody mixtures which formed a precipitate revealed large cytoplasmic vacuoles containing precipitates in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes; such engorged cells subsequently failed to phagocytize streptococci in homologous serum. Blood cells treated in the same manner, except that the antigen-antibody mixtures formed no precipitate, contained no vacuoles, and these cells were able to phagocytize the streptococci. 4. Leukocytes studied in the living state in the presence of colored precipitate and streptococci sensitized by convalescent human serum showed unselective phagocytosis of both precipitate and bacteria. The capacity of these leukocytes to ingest material however was limited. 5. As a result of non-selective saturation of their phagocytic capacity in the bacteriostatic systems containing both streptococci and precipitate, the limited number of leukocytes phagocytized only a fraction of the streptococci; consequently the remainder were able to multiply.

A non-antigenic mucoid polysaccharide similar to that described by Kendall, Heidelberger, and Dawson was isolated from group C hemolytic streptococci. A simple method for its quantitative estimation is described. By means of this quantitative method, as well as by the direct isolation of the carbohydrates, the size and persistence of capsules in young cultures of various strains have been related to the non-antigenic mucoid polysaccharide. Similarly, invasiveness in different strains has been related to the mucoid polysaccharide. Data indicating the non-haptene nature of this material are presented. An autolytic process, accelerated by bile, is involved in the loss of capsular material from young streptococci.	THE VIRULENCE OF GROUP C HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI OF ANIMAL ORIGIN	C. V.

1. Confirming the observations of other experimenters, it has been found that group A hemolytic streptococci produce a capsule containing a polysaccharide which is similar to, if not identical with, certain high molecular weight sugars found in the mammalian body. 2. Leech extract possesses a powerful enzyme capable of splitting one of the linkages in this polysaccharide and of decapsulating group A and group C hemolytic streptococci in vitro and in vivo. 3. Mice and guinea pigs can be protected from intraperitoneal infection with a virulent group C streptococcus by the intraperitoneal administration of leech extract. In contrast there is little protective action of leech extract in mice infected with group A hemolytic streptococci. 4. The protective effect of leech extract against streptococcal group C infection is probably due to the removal of the capsule in vivo. 5. The capsule of mouse virulent group C streptococci plays a major rôle in the virulence of that microorganism, while the capsule of certain mouse virulent group A streptococci plays little, if any, rôle in virulence, at least when the infection is intraperitoneal in the mouse.

1. A quantitative turbidimetric method for the estimation of hyaluronidase activity, based on the ability of the enzyme to decrease the capacity of the polysaccharide to precipitate acidified protein has been developed. Two units of hyaluronidase, by this method, are equivalent to one viscosity-reducing unit. 2. Hyaluronidase added to a phagocytic system containing defibrinated human blood, immune or non-immune, greatly increases the rate of phagocytosis of group A streptococci. Phagocytosis of Type I pneumococci is not affected by hyaluronidase under the same conditions. 3. The bactericidal activity of non-immune blood against group A streptococci is increased by hyaluronidase; the activity of immune blood is, however, somewhat inhibited by the enzyme. Killing of pneumococci is not affected by the presence of the enzyme. 4. Mice can be protected against group A streptococcal infection by frequent treatment with 200 turbidity-reducing units of hyaluronidase; the protective action of the enzyme is removed by heating at 60°C. for 1 hour. Mice infected with Type I pneumococcus and treated with hyaluronidase die somewhat sooner than the untreated controls.

1. Ribonucleic acid of yeast causes the formation of a potent hemolysin in broth cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes. 2. The hemolysin whose formation is induced by yeast ribonucleic acid appears to be identical with streptolysin S. 3. Desoxyribonucleic acid, products of acid or alkaline hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid, or many other substances tested, fail to produce a similar effect. 4. Digestion by ribonuclease increases markedly the streptolysin-inducing activity of certain preparations of ribonucleic acid. 5. A fraction (AF) of yeast nucleic acid has been isolated which possesses approximately 100 times the streptolysin-inducing capacity of the starting material. Some of the properties which distinguish AF, a polynucleotide, from ordinary yeast nucleic acid are described. AF is associated with the ribonuclease-resistant fraction of yeast nucleic acid. 6. Ribonucleic acid prepared from streptococci, wheat germ, and mammalian liver, and subsequently treated with ribonuclease, is about as active in causing streptolysin formation as ribonuclease-treated yeast nucleic acid. 7. Ribonucleic acid of tobacco mosaic virus, tested under comparable conditions, was found to be inactive. 8. Ribonucleic acid prepared from streptococci, wheat germ, and tobacco mosaic virus resembles yeast nucleic acid in possessing a ribonuclease-resistant fraction. 9. In addition to AF, a factor (or factors), present in meat infusion and in peptone, was found to be required for the formation of streptolysin. 10. The factor can be partially replaced by any one of several carbohydrates, the most active being maltose, glucosamine, and trehalose, in that order. 11. When appropriate concentrations of AF, maltose, and glucose are used, the nucleic acid-induced streptolysin can be produced in a medium whose chemical composition is essentially defined.

The kinetics of the hemolytic reaction effected by the hemolysin of Clostridium septicum, strain 44, has been studied with regard to the effect of concentration, temperature, and hydrogen ion concentration on the rate of the hemolytic reaction. The kinetics of hemolysis was found to resemble in several respects that of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but differed in the absence of a clearly defined pH optimum. Attention is drawn to differences between the hemolytic system studied and certain other hemolytic systems.	KINETICS OF LYSIS BY CLOSTRIDIUM SEPTICUM HEMOLYSIN	Alan W. Bernheimer	19871420	1944-10-01	1	
The relation of the lethal toxin to the hemolysin produced by Clostridium septicum, strain 44, has been investigated. The following results suggest that the hemolytic and lethal actions of crude toxin are functions of a single substance or that they are functions of two substances which have similar physical, chemical, and antigenic properties. (1) Within the limits of experimental error, the lethal activity of cultures is directly proportional to their hemolytic activity. (2) Treatment of a culture supernate with hydrogen peroxide diminishes to the same extent its hemolytic and lethal activities. (3) The hemolytic principle and the lethal toxin are adsorbed to approximately the same extent by charcoal. (4) The hemolytic principle and the lethal toxin are adsorbed to approximately the same extent by kaolin. (5) Treatment of culture supernate with erythrocytes results in the removal of most of the lethal activity as well as of most of the hemolytic activity. (6) Both lethal toxin and hemolytic principle are partially destroyed in dilute solution at 36°C. The loss in lethal and hemolytic activities occurs in parallel. (7) The lethal and hemolytic activities of cultures are found to be inseparable by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate. (8) The antihemolytic capacity of antitoxic horse serum is found to be directly proportional to the antilethal capacity.

As a preliminary to the study of desoxyribonuclease elaboration by resting cells, 34 strains of streptococci were examined for their capacity to produce desoxyribonuclease in broth cultures. The largest amounts of enzyme were found to be produced by strains belonging to Lancefield group A and by certain strains belonging to groups C and D. Many strains, especially those belonging to other groups, produced little or no enzyme. Washed cocci of certain strains elaborated desoxyribonuclease extracellularly upon suspending them in a solution containing an energy source, phosphate and magnesium ions. When any one of these factors was omitted, no enzyme was produced. The appearance of extracellular desoxyribonuclease was found to be inhibited by a variety of enzyme poisons, and this and other findings indicate that desoxyribonuclease is synthesized in the resting cell system. Cocci were found to contain a substance which partially inhibits the desoxyribonuclease formed by group A strains but which fails to inhibit the desoxyribonuclease formed by strains belonging to groups B and C or to inhibit the desoxyribonuclease derived from yeast, barley, and pancreas. The inhibitor of group A desoxyribonuclease has been identified as streptococcal ribonucleic acid. Preparations of ribonucleic acid derived from yeast differed from streptococcal ribonucleic acid in failing to inhibit the group A desoxyribonuclease.

Concentrates of the extracellular products of group A streptococci were prepared which were essentially free of constituents of the medium. The extracellular products appeared to consist primarily of protein material. The yield of total extracellular products was of the order of magnitude of 10 mg. per liter of supernatant broth. When studied by zone electrophoresis, the concentrates showed protein over a wide distribution with distinct peaks in certain areas. The locations of streptolysin O, streptokinase, desoxyribonuclease, and ribonuclease activities were identified, and partial separation of these enzymes was achieved. Considerable variation in the electrophoretic patterns of the extracellular products from different strains was noted.

1. Type-specific anaphylactic shock was produced with HCI extracts of Streptococcus hæmolyticus in guinea pigs passively sensitized with antibacterial sera. 2. With occasional sera and certain HCl extracts, type-specific shock was not produced unless the serum was first absorbed with heterologous bacteria or unless the guinea pigs were desensitized with heterologous extracts before testing with the homologous extract. The findings indicated that this was due to the presence of the non-type-specific substance which has been provisionally designated as Y. 3. Tryptic digestion destroyed the ability of HCI extracts containing the type-specific M substance and the non-type-specific Y substance to produce anaphylactic shock in passively sensitized guinea pigs. 4. Active sensitization was not accomplished with the type-specific M. It seems probable, therefore, that this substance is a hapten, reacting with antibodies but not stimulating their production after separation from the bacterial cell.

A biological classification has been made of thirty strains of Friedländer's bacillus. This study reveals that there exist among these strains three sharply defined and specific types and one heterogeneous group. The three types are Type A, fifteen strains; Type B, six strains; Type C, three strains; and Group X, six strains. The agglutination, agglutinin adsorption, protection, thread, and precipitin reactions have been employed in the working out of this classification, and the types have been proved highly specific by means of each serological test.

By a method of differential centrifugation and tryptic digestion suspensions of elementary bodies have been prepared from chorioallantoic membranes of chick embryos infected with vaccine virus. The infective titer of the final suspension of elementary bodies was usually the same as that of the original tissue emulsion. Elementary bodies from infected chick membranes were agglutinated as well by antivaccinal serum obtained from different mammalian species as were bodies prepared from inoculated rabbit skin. Seitz filtrates of infected chick material contained soluble precipitable substances of vaccinia; these filtrates and filtrates from infected rabbit skin, respectively, reacted equally well with rabbit serum which contained either L or S antibodies.

Evidence was presented substantiating the idea that our active agent is a virus. The reactions produced in laboratory animals by the active agent were described, and a comparison of it with other viruses was made. The results of experiments indicating the immunological identity of our virus, Armstrong and Lillie's virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and Traub's virus were given in detail. Finally, the evidence in regard to its natural host and its importance as a factor in diseases of human beings was presented and discussed.	MENINGITIS IN MAN CAUSED BY A FILTERABLE VIRUS II.

A soluble malarial antigen which fixes complement with immune serum is found in the serum of monkeys infected with Plasmodium knowlesi. The amount of antigen in the serum is related to the parasite count during the acute phase of the infection. The antigen is not excreted in the urine. Intravenous injection into normal monkeys of serum containing the antigen stimulates the production of specific complement-fixing antibodies which react with antigens extracted from parasitized cells, as well as with the antigen present in serum obtained during the acute phase of infection. Monkeys immunized with serum antigen apparently possess very little or no immunity to infection. The soluble malarial antigen is labile to acids and alkalies, is not destroyed by a temperature of 56°C., and is precipitated, for the most part, in the albumin fraction of the serum by ammonium sulfate.

A method has been described by which a stable, serologically active substance has been isolated in a relatively pure state from tissues infected with vaccine virus. It has the characteristics of an alcohol-soluble protein which is not precipitated by boiling in a neutral aqueous solution. In a dilution of 1:640,000 it gives a precipitate when mixed with a serum containing antibodies against Craigie's S antigen of vaccine virus, but no visible reaction occurs when it is mixed with serum depleted of S antibodies by means of absorption.

The soluble antigen of myxoma is a heat-labile protein which has an isoelectric point near pH 4.5 and is precipitated from half saturated solutions of ammonium sulfate. It can be partially purified by methods of differential precipitation based on variations in the pH and electrolyte concentration. Rabbits receiving the labile, soluble substance of myxoma develop homologous precipitins and their serum agglutinates elementary bodies of myxoma, provided the dermal pulp from which the bodies are obtained contains the soluble substance; neutralizing antibodies do not appear, however, and the animals are not resistant to infection with the virus of myxoma. Elementary bodies of myxoma appear to have a heat-stable agglutinogen that operates when brought in contact with serum from animals recovered from myxoma, but little, if at all, when in contact with anti-soluble substance serum.

"Spore integuments of Bacillus coagulans were prepared containing nearly all the hexosamine and α, ε-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) present in intact spores. Subsequent autolytic action resulted in the destruction and removal of the residual cortical structure and ""cortical membrane"" leaving the appearance of the inner and outer spore coats unchanged in electron micrographs. Concurrently, all the hexosamine and DAP in the preparation was released mainly as non-diffusible mucopeptide containing alanine, glutamic acid, DAP, and all the glucosamine and muramic acid. Some diffusible peptides containing alanine, glutamic acid, and DAP were also present but there was little protein or carbohydrate. Lysozyme digestion of integument preparations from heated spores of Bacillus 636, B. subtilis, B. coagulans, and B. stearothermophilus specifically removed the residual cortex and cortical membrane with the release of the mucopeptide. In B. cereus T, only the residual cortex and part of the mucopeptide were solubilized by lysozyme. The effect of several reagents and enzymes upon the appearance and removal of hexosamine from B. coagul ans spore integuments is reported. The results show that spore mucopeptide is mainly located in the residual cortex and cortical membrane and suggest that these structures consist essentially of mucopeptide. The implications of these results in relation to the ""contractile cortex"" theory of heat resistance in spores are discussed."	LOCATION AND COMPOSITION OF SPORE MUCOPEPTIDE IN BACILLUS SPECIES	A. D.

A substance is regularly present in saline extracts of the Brown-Pearce rabbit carcinoma growth which is capable of fixing complement specifically in mixture with the sera of certain rabbits bearing the tumor or in which this has recently retrogressed, as the foregoing experiments have shown. The substance was not demonstrable in extracts of the normal tissues, virus papillomas, or uterine cancers of rabbits, nor in extracts of rabbit tissues infected with certain viruses (vaccine virus, Virus III, fibroma virus). The sera of normal rabbits, of those immune to a variety of infectious diseases, including syphilis, vaccinia, fibromatosis, and Virus III, and of others with uterine cancers or virus-induced papillomas, failed to fix complement specifically in mixture with extracts containing the antigen of the Brown-Pearce tumor. The significance of the findings will be discussed in the succeeding paper, after consideration has been given to some of the properties of the serologically active material derived from the Brown-Pearce tumor.

The results of seven methods of transplantation of a malignant tumor of the rabbit are reported and contrasted with results obtained by intratesticular inoculation. It was found that inoculations made into the brain, the anterior chamber of the eye, and the muscles gave an almost uniform series of takes with the production of comparatively large and vigorously growing tumors. Intracutaneous inoculations were less favorable, while with subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraperitoneal inoculations, a growth was obtained in only 20 to 25 per cent of the animals. In contrast with the malignant course of the disease produced by testicular transplantation, the tumors produced by methods other than intracerebral inoculation were relatively benign. In all cases, the growth was of a purely local character; in some instances, there was invasion of the surrounding tissues with local or regional extension of the growth, but no metastases developed in distant organs. Tumors in the brain soon caused death as a result of pressure, and the ultimate fate of tumors in the eye was not determined, but the growth produced by other methods of local inoculation was of relatively short duration and terminated with spontaneous resolution. It was found that while a good growth could be obtained with material which had been subjected to repeated freezing, thawing, and grinding, the use of cell-free filtrates or desiccated tumor tissue gave negative results. In discussing the experiments reported, it was pointed out that there were three groups of factors which had played important parts in determining the results of transplantation. These were the capacity for growth of the tumor cells, animal resistance, and the advantage given the tumor or the animal by the use of a particular method of inoculation. From an analysis of the results obtained with reference to the operation of these factors, the conclusion was reached that while the quality of malignancy displayed by the tumor was conditioned upon the capacity for growth of the tumor cells, the degree of malignancy exhibited in any given instance was a function of animal resistance which was not entirely specific but corresponded closely with the ability of the animal to meet excess demands arising from other causes and, to this extent, represented an expression of the functional capacity of a mechanism which is concerned primarily with the maintenance of the general animal economy.

The results obtained by intratesticular inoculation of a malignant tumor of the rabbit are presented in the form of a general summary covering the phenomena of growth and spontaneous regression of the tumor and the clinical evidence of disease in tumor animals. Under ordinary circumstances, growth is obtained by this method of inoculation in practically all animals, and the majority of them show metastases. The ultimate fate of tumor animals is variable. Spontaneous regression is of frequent occurrence, and apparent recovery may take place even after extensive metastases have developed. More often, the disease terminates fatally. The course of the disease may be fulminating in character with death occurring 6 to 7 weeks after inoculation, or it may be prolonged over a period of more than 6 months, but death usually occurs between 7 weeks and 3 months after inoculation. The symptomatology varies with the course of tumor growth but is in general that of a debilitating disease of an acute or chronic character in which the picture is frequently complicated by symptoms referable to mechanical causes or to one or more of the glands of internal secretion. The most prominent of these are due to the presence of metastases in the suprarenals or pituitary body, in which case symptoms of Addison's disease or diseases of the pituitary may be superimposed upon those attributable to the presence of extensive tumor growths. In the absence of such growths, however, the symptoms of suprarenal or pituitary involvement may dominate the picture.	STUDIES BASED ON A MALIGNANT TUMOR OF THE RABBIT III.

A report is given of the results obtained by intratesticular inoculation of a malignant tumor of the rabbit based on a study of the first twenty generations. The subject is presented from the standpoint of variations in growth and malignancy as they occurred with continued transplantation. Essential features of the experimental conditions and of clinical and postmortem observations are condensed and recorded graphically. On analyzing the results of these experiments, it was found that many changes had occurred in the behavior of the tumor during transplantation, but that the changes were of a very irregular character and as a rule did not proceed constantly in any given direction. Moreover, the evidence as to the effect of transplantation on the growth and malignancy of the tumor was contradictory in that there was a great deal of evidence to show that there had been a decided increase in the activity and capacity for growth on the part of the tumor cells. But, with the exception of a few generations, there was an apparent reduction in the incidence and percentage distribution of secondary tumors, while the death rate was unaltered or actually diminished. It was believed that this paradoxical situation afforded a basis for an explanation of the results that had been obtained by transplantation.	STUDIES BASED ON A MALIGNANT TUMOR OF THE RABBIT VI.

A change in the type of lesion produced by the fibroma virus has been observed. At about its 18th serial transfer in domestic rabbits the virus lost its ability to induce fibromas when administered subcutaneously. Instead, lesions developing in either the subcutaneous tissue or in the testicle were predominantly inflammatory in character and partly composed of lymphocytes and large mononuclear cells in place of fibroblast-like cells. Andrewes, working with the same virus in England, has observed a somewhat similar change. Passage of my changed virus through cottontail rabbits results in a transient recovery of the capacity to produce fibromata, while similar passage of Andrewes' inflammatory virus is without effect.

A study of a malignant disease in rabbits has been made with reference to the presence or absence of a filterable virus, Virus III, in the tumor. The results are analyzed from the standpoint of certain characteristic features of the tumor process in order to determine any differences in degrees of malignancy. It was found that a more severe disease developed in the series in which the virus-bearing tumor was used than in the series in which the tumor was free of the virus, although the differences were not very marked and were not entirely constant. The influence of Virus III as a factor affecting malignancy has been discussed from the standpoint of its possible effect upon (α) the tumor cells and (b) the host reaction. It has been suggested that the greater malignancy of the pathological process usually induced by the virus-bearing tumor is attributable to a change in the response of the host to the tumor, which change is of the nature of a decreased resistance associated with the reaction of the host to the virus infection.

The application of methylcholanthrene and tar to virus-induced papillomas of the domestic rabbit caused them to become carcinomatous with great rapidity, and the malignant changes were frequently multiple. In bringing on the cancers the chemical agents acted in their specific capacity as carcinogens, not as ordinary stimulants of cell proliferation. The cancers derived from the virus-infected cells and were of the same types as arise from these elements spontaneously after a much longer time. The evidence would seem to indicate that the chemical carcinogens acted by way of the virus.	THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL CARCINOGENS ON VIRUS-INDUCED RABBIT PAPILLOMAS	Peyton Rous, William F.

Foreign bodies and bezoars are commonly encountered in children. We describe a child aged 11 years who ingested large amounts of plastic material used for knitting chairs and charpoys. The conglomerate of plastic threads, entrapped food material and other debris, formed a huge mass occupying the whole stomach. Chronic irritation of the gastric antral mucosa led to ulceration and formation of hyperplastic polyps. We labeled this new entity as a “plastobezoar”. The entire bezoar could be removed endoscopically.

A 58 year old man underwent a laparotomy for intestinal obstruction, which proved to be due to intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Following a slow postoperative course, he was discovered to have a gastric phytobezoar. The association between bezoars and pseudo-obstruction has not been previously described, but might be expected. The gastric phytobezoar could not be fragmented mechanically, but it completely disappeared when enteral feeding was commenced. The possibility of a future role of enteral feeding in this situation is suggested.	Gastric phytobezoar: unusual association and resolution.	J. P. Wyatt, G. Haddock, R. J.

Nutrient malabsorption and diarrhea are characteristic of the blind loop syndrome. Alterations in motility have been implicated as a cause of bacterial overgrowth, but the possibility that altered motility may result from alterations in the flora has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to characterize the myoelectric activity of the small intestine in the blind loop rat model. Eight groups of rats were studied: rats with self-filling blind loops, which develop bacterial overgrowth; rats with self-emptying blind loops, which are surgical controls that do not develop overgrowth; unoperated litter mates; rats with self-filling blind loops and unoperated controls treated with chloramphenicol, 200 mg/d i.p.; rats with surgically removed self-filling blind loops; operated control rats; and gnotobiotic rats with self-filling blind loops. In the untreated rats with self-filling blind loops, there was altered myoelectric activity characterized by an increased percentage of slow waves occupied by action potentials and by organized activity similar to the migrating action potential complex. Migrating action potential complex activity and percentage of slow waves occupied by action potentials were significantly decreased with chloramphenicol therapy; that decrease correlated with a decrease in aerobes and anaerobes. Migrating action potential complex activity was abolished in rats with surgically removed self-filling blind loops; they also showed a significant decrease in percentage of slow waves occupied by action potentials. Gnotobiotic rats with self-filling blind loops showed no alteration in myoelectric activity. These data indicate: (a) bacterial overgrowth is associated with a significant increase in percentage of slow waves occupied by action potentials and migrating action potential complex activity; (b) chloramphenicol significantly reduced both percentage of slow waves occupied by action potentials and migrating action potential complex activity; and (c) surgical removal of the loop reduced the alterations in motor function. This study suggests that the altered myoelectric activity in this model of bacterial overgrowth was due, in part, to the abnormal bacterial flora and supports the concept that alterations in motility may contribute to the diarrhea that is characteristic of the blind loop syndrome.

The possibility that malabsorbed fat passing through the human ileum exerts an inhibitory feedback control on jejunal motility has been investigated in 24 normal subjects by perfusing the ileum with a fat containing solution designed to produce ileal luminal fat concentrations similar to those in steatorrhoea (30-40 mg/ml). Mean transit times through a 30 cm saline perfused jejunal segment were measured by a dye dilution technique. Thirty minutes after ileal fat perfusion, mean transit times rose markedly to 18.9 +/- 2.5 minutes from a control value of 7.5 +/- 0.9 minutes (n = 5; p less than 0.05). This was associated with an increase in volume of the perfused segment which rose to 175.1 +/- 22.9 ml (control 97.6 +/- 10.3 ml, n = 5; p less than 0.05). Transit times and segmental volumes had returned towards basal values 90 minutes after completing the fat perfusion. Further studies showed that ileal fat perfusion produced a pronounced inhibition of jejunal pressure wave activity, percentage duration of activity falling from a control level of 40.3 +/- 5.0% to 14.9 +/- 2.8% in the hour after ileal perfusion (p less than 0.01). Ileal fat perfusion was associated with marked rises in plasma enteroglucagon and neurotensin, the peak values (218 +/- 37 and 68 +/- 13.1 pmol/l) being comparable with those observed postprandially in coeliac disease. These observations show the existence in man of an inhibitory intestinal control mechanism, whereby ileal fat perfusion inhibits jejunal motility and delays caudal transit of jejunal contents.

The occurrence of clinical manifestations of mechanical intestinal obstruction in eight cases of systemic amyloidosis is reported. Seven similar cases have been recorded in the literature and are briefly reviewed. Correct diagnosis is important in these cases if useless surgical treatment or prolonged diagnostic investigations are to be avoided. Gastrointestinal involvement by systemic amyloidosis should be considered in a patient presenting with clinical manifestations of mechanical obstruction but paralytic ileus seen on plain films. In these cases an attempt should be made, by means of a barium enema, to exclude an obstructing lesion of the colon or distal small bowel. Once amyloidosis is considered, it can be confirmed easily and safely by biopsy of the rectal or small-intestinal mucosa.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3	Intestinal pseudo-obstruction in systemic amyloidosis	David A.

Twenty-seven per cent of atopic patients initially presenting with infantile eczema or hay fever were defective for yeast opsonization and 18% had low levels of C2; these deficiencies were mutually exclusive, suggesting that they are primary.

Using myoelectric recording techniques, we examined the myoelectric effects of castor oil; ricinoleic acid (cis isomer), the active ingredient of castor oil; and ricinelaidic acid (trans isomer) in the small intestine of New Zealand white rabbits. Ricinoleic acid, 2 microgram/kg per min (6mM), was perfused into a distal 12-cm ileal loop. An abnormal myoelectric pattern developed that was similar to the alteration in the electrical activity that has previously been reported for cholera enterotoxin. Castor oil, 0.85 ml/kg, had a similar effect. Ricinelaidic acid, 2 microgram/kg per min, induced no activity. A second preparation consisted of an intraluminal perfusion of ricinoleic acid, 2 microgram/kg per min, into the first section of the duodenum. The abnormal myoelectric pattern was observed in the jejunum and the ileum but not the duodenum. The mean onset time for the development of this altered myoelectric state for all experiments was 3.5 h. These studies suggest that an active motility component in addition to the secretory state exists throughout the small intestine that is exposed to castor oil or ricinoleic acid.

The incidence of small intestinal colonization in unoperated duodenal ulcer patients was low and similar to that in the normal population. The majority of patients seven to 10 days following truncal vagotomy and drainage were colonized whereas none of a control group of patients following simple closure of a perforated duodenal ulcer was colonized. In patients with pyloroplasty, this high incidence fell to control levels on average 18 months postoperatively, but in patients with a gastro-jejunostomy, the incidence remained raised probably due to the presence of the afferent loop.Only two patients developed episodic diarrhoea and there was no obvious association with small bowel colonization.

The myoelectric response of the rabbit ileum was studied in response to live Vibrio cholerae culture, a whole cell lysate of cholera, and the purified enterotoxin. Each cholera preparation produced a series of highly organized migrating action potential complexes (MAPC). An MAPC was defined as action potential discharge with a duration of 2.5 s or longer, followed by similar activity on at least one other consecutive electrode site. The mean and modal onset time of MAPC activity occurred 4 h after the infection with live Vibrio cholerae culture, the freeze-dried whole cell lysate preparation, or the purified enterotoxin. After the onset of activity this pattern persisted for the duration of the recording period (up to 12 h). The MAPC had a mean propagation velocity of 0.85+/-0.07 cm/s (mean+/-SEM), which remained constant with time. Direct visual observation of the loop revealed that the MAPC's resulted in contractions that propelled intraluminal contents in an aborad direction. The mean fluid output from the 12-cm ileal loops was 6.4+/-1.1 ml/h (mean+/-SEM). Control experiments consisted of recordings from: (a) a ligated ileal loop into which nothing was placed; (b) a ligated ileal loop into which either uninfected culture broth or 0.9% NaCl solution was injected; (c) a ligated ileal loop infused with 0.9% NaCl solution at a rate of 11.2 ml/h, and (d) rapid injection of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0-ml boluses of 0.9% NaCl into the proximal catheter. MAPC activity was not observed in any of the control experiments. These studies indicate that in addition to a secretory component to cholera, there exists a highly organized MAPC that results in contractions that propel intraluminal contents in an aborad direction.

1. The afferent discharge of mesenteric nerves has been recorded while perfusing salines of different composition through the lumen of rat ileum. The p.d. across the ileum and hexose absorption have also been measured. 2. The ileal mesenteric nerves were sensitive to actively transported hexoses. The discharge recorded increased dramatically on perfusion with 10 or 50 mM-glucose, quietening within 3 min of returning to glucose-free saline. A similar response was obtained with galactose. 3. No change in afferent discharge could be detected on perfusion of mannitol or the slowly transferred hexose, mannose. It is concluded that the response to glucose and galactose is not dependent on the stimulation of non-specific luminal osmoreceptors. 4. Phlorhizin prevented glucose from increasing the afferent nerve discharge. Subsequent perfusion with saline removed the phlorhizin and an afferent nerve response to glucose was restored. It is concluded that this response requires glucose transfer beyond the phlorhizin-sensitive glucose entry mechanism at the luminal side of the mucosal epithelial cell. 5. Very small amounts of glucose or galactose were absorbed under the conditions employed. The time course for the change in p.d. correlated well with that described for the alteration in afferent nerve discharge. 6. Electron micrographs show that ileal nerves consist of bundles of small non-myelinated fibres of approximately 1 micron diameter. 7. The significance of the findings is discussed remembering that carbohydrate absorption is considered to be completed normally in the jejunum.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Plate 1	Effect of actively transported hexoses on afferent nerve discharge from rat small intestine.

The prevalence of homozygous and heterozygous deficiency of the second component of complement (C2) was determined in patients with rheumatic disease including 137 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 274 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and 134 with rheumatoid arthritis. 1 C2 homozygous deficient and 19 possible heterozygous deficient individuals were identified by using both immunochemical and functional assays to determine C2 levels. Of the 20, 8 had SLE (5.9%), 10 had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (3.7%), and 2 had rheumatoid arthritis (1.4%), the homozygous deficient individual having SLE. The prevalence of C2 deficiency in the SLE and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients was significantly increased (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.02, respectively) when compared with controls, 6 (1.2%) of 509 blood donors having C2 levels consistent with heterozygous deficiency. 15 of the 20 C2 deficient patients were HLA typed and found to have antigens A10(Aw25), B18, or both. The patients with C2 deficiency and SLE had earlier age of onset of disease and less antinuclear antibody when compared with the C2 normal SLE patients. 11 families of the propositi were studied and found to have one or more C2 heterozygous deficient individuals. The family members had an equal distribution of rheumatic disease and antinuclear antibody in the C2 deficient and C2 normal groups. C2 deficient individuals were found to have significantly lower levels of properdin Factor B (242 mug/ml+/-54) when compared with the non-C2 deficient family members (282 mug/ml+/-73). These data support the concept that inherited deficiency of C2 is significantly associated with both SLE and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	Inherited deficiency of the second component of complement.

A technique is described for collecting thoracic duct lymph in a portable glass saddle from an unrestrained rat.Uniformly labelled oleic acid in various physical states was given to rats with thoracic duct and bile fistulae to study the influence of bile salts on the amount absorbed and on the route of transport and esterification after absorption. It is suggested that in addition to their emulsifying action bile salts may stimulate the esterification of absorbed oleic acid by the intestinal mucosa.

The effects of cholera enterotoxin on intestinal ion transport were examined in vitro. Addition of dialyzed filtrate of Vibrio cholerae (crude toxin) to the luminal side of isolated rabbit ileal mucosa caused a delayed and gradually progressive increase in transmural electric potential difference (PD) and shortcircuit current (SCC). A similar pattern was observed upon addition of a highly purified preparation of cholera toxin, although the changes in PD and SCC were smaller. Na and Cl fluxes across the short-circuited mucosa were determined with radioisotopes 3-4 hr after addition of crude toxin or at a comparable time in control tissues. The toxin caused a net secretory flux of Cl and reduced to zero the net absorptive flux of Na. Similar flux changes were observed when either crude or purified toxin was added in vivo and tissues were mounted in vitro 3-4 hr later. Additon of D-glucose to the luminal side of toxin-treated mucosa produced a large net absorptive flux of Na without altering the net Cl and residual ion fluxes.Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate (cyclic AMP) and theophylline had previously been shown to cause a rapid increase in SCC and ion flux changes similar to those induced by cholera toxin. Pretreatment of ileal mucosa with either crude or purified cholera toxin greatly reduced the SCC response to theophylline and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which, together with the flux data, suggest that both cyclic AMP and cholera toxin stimulate active secretion by a common pathway. Inhibition of the SCC response to theophylline was observed after luminal but not after serosal addition of toxin. In vitro effects of cholera toxin correlated closely with in vivo effects: heating toxin destroyed both; two V. cholerae filtrates which were inactive in vivo proved also to be inactive in vitro; PD and volume flow measurements in isolated, in vivo ileal loops of rabbit revealed that the PD pattern after addition of toxin is similar to that seen in vitro and also correlates closely with changes in fluid movement. The results suggest that stimulation by cholera toxin of a cyclic AMP-dependent active secretory process of the intestinal epithelial cells is a major cause of fluid loss in cholera.

The mechanism of hydroxy fatty acid-induced secretion was investigated in perfused hamster small intestine in vivo. Sodium ricinoleate at an 8-mM concentration resulted in not only secretion of water and sodium, but an increase in intestinal clearance of inulin and a 16,000 mol wt dextran as well. A concentration of ricinoleate (2 mM) which did not affect water transport, however, did not alter intestinal permeability. Ricinoleate-induced intestinal secretion was also accompanied by increased mucosal cell exfoliation as measured by the appearance of DNA in the perfusate and by apparent injury to epithelial cell membranes as judged by measurement of sucrase activity and phospholipid in cell-free aliquots of luminal fluid. Light and electron microscopic studies demonstrated substantial mucosal architectural changes with 8 mM ricinoleate with villus shortening and injury to epithelial cells at the villus tips. In contrast, cholera enterotoxin caused marked secretion of sodium and water, presumably by a cyclic AMP mechanism, but did not alter inulin clearance or enhance DNA or sucrase appearance in the lumen. These studies suggest that at least a component of ricinoleate-induced intestinal secretion is related to structural alterations of the mucosa.Images	The effects of sodium ricinoleate on small intestinal function and structure.

The postprandial concentrations of free and conjugated bile acids were measured in total content and micellar phase of jejunal aspirates from nine patients with steatorrhoea due to the stagnant loop syndrome and from 11 normal controls. Aspirates from the stagnant loop syndrome patients, but not from the normal controls, had a high concentration of free (unconjugated) bile acids. There was a reciprocal decrease in the concentration of conjugated bile acids, but total bile acid concentration in the whole aspirate remained normal. Total bile acid concentration in the micellar phase of intestinal content was reduced, indicating precipitation of bile acids. These findings suggest that precipitation of unconjugated bile acids, rather than passive absorption, leads to a reduced postprandial concentration of bile acids in the micellar phase of jejunal content, and are consistent with the hypothesis that fat malabsorption in the stagnant loop syndrome results from decreased micellar dispersion of lipolytic products.

Both cholera enterotoxin and certain prostaglandins have been shown to stimulate intestinal fluid secretion in vivo, to cause ion flux changes in vitro similar to those caused by addition of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and to activate intestinal mucosal adenyl cyclase. It has been suggested that the effects of the enterotoxin on intestinal cyclic AMP metabolism may be indirect, and that locally synthesized prostaglandins may serve as required intermediates for the effects of the enterotoxin in activating intestinal mucosal adenyl cyclase. In order to clarify certain aspects of the mechanisms by which these two agents alter intestinal mucosal cyclic AMP metabolism and ion transport, their effects on cyclic AMP accumulation in rabbit ileal mucosa were examined in vitro. Addition of 5 μg per ml (75 μg per 150 mg mucosa) of purified cholera enterotoxin produced a peak increase in cyclic AMP level in 3 h but there was a time delay of at least 30 min before any effect was observed. Inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with theophylline failed to reduce this time delay. In contrast, addition of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) increased the cyclic AMP level rapidly, a peak effect being observed in 2 min. The time of the peak prostaglandin-induced changes in cyclic AMP level and short-circuit current correlated closely. A maximal increment in cyclic AMP level was achieved with 5 × 10−5 M PGE1. When 10−4 M PGE1 was added to mucosa already maximally stimulated with cholera toxin, the resulting cyclic AMP level was equal to the sum of the levels reached when each agent was added alone. Furthermore, the effects of the enterotoxin on mucosal cyclic AMP levels were not influenced by indomethacin under conditions where mucosal prostaglandins synthesis was inhibited. The results suggest that endogenous prostaglandins do not provide an essential link in the activation of intestinal mucosal adenyl cyclase by cholera enterotoxin. The present study also indicates that the effect of cholera enterotoxin on intestinal mucosal cyclic AMP metabolism involves a definite time delay which is not due to cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.

1. Acetylcholine increases the potential difference across rat proximal colon both in vivo and in vitro.2. There is a sigmoid relationship between the change in potential difference and the logarithm of the dose of acetylcholine. The dose—response curve is shifted to the left by neostigmine and to the right by atropine, suggesting that the action of acetylcholine is mediated by a muscarinic type of receptor.3. The dose-response curve for acetylcholine in vivo is not altered by the ganglion-blocking agents hexamethonium and pentolinium, suggesting a direct effect of this transmitter on the colon.4. Acetylcholine causes an increase in potential difference, a small decrease in resistance and hence a rise in the current generated by both normal and stripped everted sacs of rat colon.5. In the absence of sodium, the calculated current change produced by acetylcholine is reduced, and the removal of chloride has a similar inhibitory effect. The absence of bicarbonate does not significantly affect the response.6. Acetylcholine virtually abolished net sodium movement and induced net chloride secretion and these changes accounted for the increased short-circuit current.7. Acetylcholine had no effect on oxygen consumption by rings of colon.8. Tracts staining for acetylcholinesterase were observed running from the submucous plexus towards the mucosal epithelium.9. This study shows that acetylcholine can influence ion movement by rat colonic mucosa and suggests that the autonomic nervous system might be involved in the regulation of transport mechanisms in this tissue.ImagesPlate 1	The role of acetylcholine in the regulation of ion transport by rat colon mucosa	J.

The possibility that the autonomic nervous system may influence the function of intestinal mucosa was investigated by assessing the effect of acetyl choline on ion transport in human intestine. Isolated pieces of stripped ileal mucosa were mounted in Perspex flux-chambers and bathed in isotonic glucose Ringer's solution. Acetyl choline caused a rise in mean potential difference (8.8-12.3 mV, P less than 0.002) and short circuit current (287.7-417.2 muA-cm-2, P less than 0.01) (n = 12), observable at a concentration of 0.01 mM and maximal at 0.1 mM. This effect was enhanced by neostigmine and blocked by atropine. Isotopic flux determinations revealed a change from a small mean net Cl absorption (58) to a net Cl secretion (-4.3mueq-cm-2-h-1P less than 0.001) due predominantly to an increase in the serosal to mucosal unidirectional flux of Cl (10.63-14.35 mueq-cm-2-h-1P less than 0.05) and a smaller reduction in the mucosal to serosal flux (11.22 to 10.02 mueq-cm-2-h-1P less than 0.05). Unidirectional and net Na transport was unaffected. A similar electrical and ion transport response was observed in a single study of two pieces of jejunal mucosa. In the absence of glucose net chloride secretion was produced and again an insignificant effect on net sodium transport was noted. Acetyl choline did not provoke a sustained effect on mucosal cyclic adenine nucleotide levels although a short-lived cyclic adenine nucleotide response was seen in some tissues 20-30 s after drug addition. These studies demonstrate that acetyl choline does influence human intestinal ion transport by stimulating chloride secretion and suggest a possible mechanism by which the parasympathetic nervous system could be concerned in the control of ion transport.Images	In vitro behavior of human intestinal mucosa.

In a general hospital, 391 consecutive necropsies in which at least seven organs were available, were examined retrospectively by polarizing microscopy of Congo-red-stained sections for the presence of local amyloid deposits.Non-systemic microdeposits of amyloid were encountered in 72 cases, an overall incidence of 18·4%. They were usually small and frequently detectable only by virtue of polarizing microscopy. There is no indication that these microdeposits of amyloid are of pathogenetic significance. Although they sometimes occur in more than one organ, such deposits can be readily distinguished from those of systemic amyloidosis by their histological features.Images	Incidence and origin of non-systemic microdeposits of amyloid	Mordechai Ravid, Joseph Gafni, Ezra Sohar, Hans-Peter Missmahl	5334538	1967-01-01	15

Mice infected shortly after birth with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus are not immunologically tolerant, although they carry the virus throughout life. These LCM carrier mice make anti-LCM antibody, which apparently complexes with viral antigen in the circulation and these complexes accumulate in the glomeruli. LCM carrier mice of different strains vary significantly as to concentration of detectable infectious virus in their tissue, amount and time of appearance of anti-LCM antibody, and development of an associated chronic disease. The chronic disease consists primarily of glomerulonephritis, focal hepatic necrosis, and disseminated lymphoid infiltrations. LCM carriers of the SWR/J strain contain high tissue concentrations of virus, considerable anti-LCM antibody detectable in the glomeruli by 3 wk to 2 months of age and develop chronic disease within the first 2–3 months of life. In contrast, C3H strain LCM carriers contain 1/1000 as much infectious virus, less detectable anti-LCM antibody, and have not, over a 24 month observation period, developed any detectable disease. B10D2 old and new carrier mice with intermediate amounts of virus develop chronic disease during the latter half of the first year of life. The pathogenesis of the glomerulonephritis of chronic LCM disease is apparently related to the formation of circulating virus-antibody complexes which are trapped in the glomerular filter. There is no evidence for direct glomerular injury by the virus nor for any autoimmune response by the host.

Ajax mice fed a diet with a reduced proportion of protein, cleared carbon more slowly, and produced less antibody of lower affinity, when immunized with human serum transferrin (HST) in saline than did normally fed controls. This finding is discussed in terms of the defective antibody response in protein-malnourished children, and the possible contribution such environmental factors may have on immunopathological and neoplastic effects of infection.

The rate of elimination of soluble protein antigen injected intravenously differs in different inbred strains of mice previously immunized to the antigen. This difference is apparently related to the affinity of the antibody they produce. Animals producing high affinity antibody eliminate antigen more effectively than those producing low affinity antibody. Passive transfer of antibody shows that the difference of antigen elimination is a property of the antibody, rather than the cellular mechanisms involved. The immunopathological significance of these findings is discussed.	Differences in immune elimination in inbred mice: the role of low affinity antibody	J. H. Alpers, M. W. Steward, J. F.

Random-bred TO mice have been selectively bred into two lines on the basis of the relative affinity (KR) of antibody produced to protein antigens, one line producing high and the other low KR antibody. After four generations of selective breeding the difference in KR between the two lines was highly significant (P less than 0-001). The selection on the basis of KR did not result in a corresponding selection for antibody levels (Abt), which were not significantly different in the two lines. These results indicate that antibody affinity is a genetically controlled parameter of the immune response. Furthermore, this control appears to be expressed by a mechanism which is independent of the amount of antibody produced.	The genetic control of antibody affinity in mice.

Mice of two inbred strains, prone to nephritis following neonatal lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, produced antibody of lower affinity to two soluble protein antigens, human serum albumin and transferrin, than did two nephritis-resistant strains. Antigen in adjuvant elicited higher affinity antibody than did antigen in saline, in the nephritis-prone mice. The significance of these findings in the pathogenesis and treatment of nephritis, arthritis and other possible soluble complex disease is discussed.

Anti-RNA antibodies were found in 82% of 28 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) probands and in 16% of 124 of their family members. The incidence in 76 control family members was only 5%. In the SLE family members, the antibodies were found exclusively in 21% of the 94 close household contacts of the probands. The incidence of anti-native DNA (nDNA) antibodies was 68% for the SLE probands. The incidence of anti-nDNA antibodies in close household contacts of the probands was 6%, which was not significantly different from the 1% incidence found in control families. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies occurred in 57% of the SLE family members as a whole and in 68% of the close household contacts. In the SLE probands, lymphocytotoxic antibodies correlated with anti-single-stranded RNA (poly A) and anti-nDNA but not with anti-double-stranded RNA (poly A-poly U). On the other hand, lymphocytotoxic antibodies in the household contacts correlated with anti-double-stranded RNA (poly A-poly U) but not with anti-poly A or anti-nDNA. The anti-RNA antibodies were present in consanguineous household contacts but not in nonconsanguineous household contacts. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that both an environmental agent, possibly a virus, as well as the genetic response are important in the pathogenesis of SLE. Family members may therefore be a logical population in whom to search for specific antibodies to a viral agent.

In these studies, a number of human cell lines including epithelial, neural, glial, and lymphoid cells infected with several strains of measles virus were found to be lysed upon incubation with fresh sera from humans containing antibody measles virus. In all instances, the cytolytic event was mediated by alternative complement (C) pathway without a significant contribution from classical pathway. In contrast, isolated measles virus in conjunction with antibody was found to selectively activate the classical C pathway. Measles antibodies of the IgG class, but not the IgA class, possessed cytolytic potential against cells infected with measles virus. Human IgG antibodies could directly activate the alternative C pathway. No defect was found in cytolytic measles antibody in sera or cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, nor was the alternative C pathway impaired in sera from these patients. Sera from newborn humans exhibited a functional alternative C pathway.	Immunologic injury of cultured cells infected with measles virus.

Herediatary C2-deficiency has been shown to be transmitted asn an autosomal recessive characteristic. Recent evidence indicates that some genetic factors involved in the control of the complement (C) system in both man and mice are governed by genes localized within the major histocompatibility regionmthis study describes a large pedigree of the paternal family of a C2-deficient patient with systemic lupus erythematosusl It is shown that this condition is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, the heterozygous carriers having approximately half normal levels of C2. Furthermore, this trait was shown to be inherited in close linkage with an infrequent HL-A typw, 2,4A2. The maternal, C2-defective chromosome was shown to be transmitted by HL-AW10, W18 haplotypemthis same haplotype was described in a similar study by Fu et al. (6) to be associated with C2 deficiencymfinally, a third haplotype HL-A2,W18 carrying a defective C2 gene was demonstrated in a part of this pedigree.

57% of sera from 124 relatives of 28 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were found to have antibody directed against lymphocytes. The incidence in 60 members of 16 control families was 3%. Both consanguineous and nonconsanguineous relatives had the antibody in their sera. 68% of close household contacts of the SLE patients showed lymphocytotoxic antibody whereas only 23% of consanguineous relatives who had no household contact with the probands had this antibody.

HL-A analysis of a family with C2 deficiency revealed evidence for close linkage between the C2 defect and the histocompatibility HL-A loci. The propositus was homozygous both for C2 deficiency and the HL-A haplotype 10,W18. Among seven children of three double backcross matings, no recombinants were found. The possible significance of such linkage is discussed.	EVIDENCE FOR LINKAGE BETWEEN HL-A HISTOCOMPATIBILITY GENES AND THOSE INVOLVED IN THE SYNTHESIS OF THE SECOND COMPONENT OF COMPLEMENT	S. M.

In an in vivo study in mice, suppression by the C3-cleaving protein of cobra venom (CoF), and other C3-reactive agents (zymosan, aggregated IgG, anti-C3 antibodies, and type III pneumococcal polysaccharide) of the thymus-dependent antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes, ovalbumin, and human IgG was demonstrated. The thymus-independent antibody response to polyvinyl-pyrrolidone was however unaffected by CoF. These and other published observations suggest that there may be a requirement for functional C3 in induction of thymus-dependent but not thymus-independent antibody production. A model for the role of C3 in lymphocyte cooperation is proposed based on these data analyzed in the light of existing knowledge of this process. It is postulated that fixed C3 interacting with macrophage See PDF for Structure and B-cell C3 receptors might enhance or facilitate T-dependent presentation of antigen to B cells.

A counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) technique has been developed for the rapid, simple, specific detection of nucleic acids as antigens, or for the detection of precipitating antibodies to nucleic acids or nuclear antigens. The majority of precipitins could be detected within 1 hr. As little as 0·0015 μg of antigen per ml (e.g. poly A: poly U) could be detected. Specificity of rabbit antisera to nucleic acids was demonstrated by selective reactions using a panel of polynucleotides. 1091 patient sera were examined for precipitins to DNA, single-stranded DNA, nucleoprotein and calf thymus nucleoprotein. Precipitins to DNA were found in 42% of systemic lupus erythematosus sera, 9% of rheumatoid arthritis sera and 4% of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis sera. Results with the CIEP method showed equal sensitivity as results obtained by complement fixation or binding assays, but were more sensitive than double diffusion in agar (Ouchterlony).

The study of serum from a patient with C2 deficiency is described. The patient had an episode of pneumococcal meningitis at 5 mo of age with seizures and transient hemiparesis and apparent purpuric skin lesions. He was first admitted to the University of Minnesota Hospitals at 10 yr of age following the discovery of proteinuria accidentally by his mother. Since then he has been admitted repeatedly to this hospital with numerous clinical findings including arthralgia, recurrent abdominal pain, proteinuria, membranous nephropathy, malar butterfly rash, seizures, personality aberrations, and recurrent fever. In June 1971, the patient developed positive DNA and DNP antibodies and positive LE cells. When the C profile was studied before and after recognition of lupus, C1q, C1s, and C4 dropped. C3 levels were elevated as were C5, C6, and C7, C3 proactivator had been reduced in the patient even before he developed lupus. Also because of a traumatic renal biopsy leading to a perirenal hematoma, he required surgery and a blood transfusion. 1 h after blood transfusion, a C2 titer of 23 hemolytic units was detected. Almost immediately levels of C3, C5, C6, and C7 dropped, C8 and C9 remained elevated. The addition of C2 from normal blood permitted dramatic activation of C3.These findings support the view that the rare deficiency in production of C2 predisposes to serious susceptibility to infection, vascular and mesenchymal disease as well as to renal disease and a lupus syndrome.Images	C2 Deficiency DEVELOPMENT OF LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS	Noorbibi K.

A patient, with deficiency of the second component of complement (C2), who has had anaphylactoid purpura for 12 years is described. Other classical complement components were present normally and the very markedly low total haemolytic complement activity was restored by the addition of functionally purified C2. Glycine-rich β-glycoprotein (GBG), measured antigenically, was reduced to about 50% of normal but the alternate pathway to complement activation was normal as judged by the platelet factor three activation test. Structures identified morphologically as mycoplasma were present in the patient's serum.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 4	Deficiency of the second component of complement associated with anaphylactoid purpura and presence of mycoplasma in the serum	M.

The studies of sera from two siblings with C1r deficiency are described. The brother (18 yr old) has shown clinical manifestations resembling lupus erythematosus for 5 yr, and the sister (24 yr old) has had arthralgia and recurrent episodes of rhinobronchitis since early childhood. Three siblings have died: one brother died at age 12 with symptoms similar to the disease of the male patient studied here, and two other siblings died in infancy, probably from infection. The low hemolytic C1 activity of the patients could be restored by the addition of purified C1r to their sera. Bactericidal activity and immune adherence were found to be impaired. When alternate pathways of the complement system were studied, both sera permitted activation of terminal components with endotoxin and cobra venom factor. These findings support the view that an alternate pathway for activation of the terminal portion of the complement cascade exists which does not utilize the conventional pathway operating through the usual early components.Images	C1r deficiency: an inborn error associated with cutaneous and renal disease	N.

Measurements of the nine components of complement in the serums of 16 members of a kindred have established the diagnosis of hereditary deficiency of the second component of complement (C2). The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance resembles that of previously described families with C2 deficiency. Both C2 activity determinations with a stoichiometric haemolytic assay and C2 protein measurements with electroimmunodiffusion against antibody monospecific for C2 detect the heterozygous deficient state. Antigenic analysis, in vitro reconstitution experiments, and the constant ratio of C2 function to C2 protein indicate that the C2 synthesized by heterozygotes is indistinguishable from normal human C2. Studies of neonatal homozygous deficient serum and maternal heterozygous deficient serum show that transplacental passage of C2 does not occur. C2 deficiency in this family is not associated with clinical defects in host resistance.ImagesFIG. 3	Hereditary deficiency of the second component of complement (C2) in man: correlation of C2 haemolytic activity with immunochemical measurements of C2 protein	S.

"Four families with C2 deficiency were studied.  Among eight HL-A haplotypes involved with C2 deficiency, five were HL-A 10,W18.	Three homozygotes for C2 deficiency from different families were mutually nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) and the heterozygotes from the fourth family failed to react to the homozygous cells.  It appeared that identical MLC determinants were associated with all the genes from the different families that related to C2 deficiency. Further experiments identified the MLC determinant, LD-7a, as being involved.  These results suggest marked linkage disequilibrium between the genes for C2 deficiency and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).  Studies of possible recombinants have offered tentative evidence for the positioning of the locus for C2 deficiency with respect to other segments of the MHC."

The intestinal pathway for absorbed fat was traced in thin sections of intestinal villi from rats fed corn oil by stomach tube after a fast of 24 to 40 hours. For electron microscopy the tissues were fixed in chilled buffered osmium tetroxide and embedded in methacrylate. For light microscopy, other specimens from the same animals were fixed in formal-calcium, mordanted in K2Cr2O7, and embedded in gelatin. Frozen sections were stained with Sudan black B or Sudan IV. About 20 minutes after feeding, small fat droplets (65 mµ maximal diameter) appear in the striated border between microvilli. At the same time fat particles are seen within pinocytotic vesicles in the immediately subjacent terminal web. In later specimens the fat droplets are generally larger (50 to 240 mµ) and lie deeper in the apical cytoplasm. All intracellular fat droplets are loosely enveloped in a thin membrane, the outer surface of which is sometimes studded with the fine particulate component of the cytoplasm. This envelope, apparently derived from the cell surface by pinocytosis, has at this stage evidently become a part of the endoplasmic reticulum. Just above the nucleus numerous fat droplets lie clustered within the dilated cisternae of the Golgi complex. As absorption progresses fat droplets appear in the intercellular spaces of the epithelium, in the interstitial connective tissue spaces of the lamina propria, and in the lumen of the lacteals. All of these extracellular fat droplets are devoid of a membranous envelope. The picture of fat absorption as reconstructed from these studies involves a stream of fat droplets filtering through the striated border, entering the epithelial cell by pinocytosis at the bases of the intermicrovillous spaces, and coursing through the endoplasmic reticulum to be discharged at the sides of the epithelial cell into extracellular spaces. From the epithelial spaces, the droplets move into the lamina propria and thence into the lymph. If the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is considered as continuous with the extracellular phase, then the entire pathway of fat absorption may be regarded as extracellular. However, it is impossible to evaluate from the electron microscopic evidence thus far available the quantitative importance of particulate fat absorption by the mechanism described.

The structure of the intestinal villus of the rat was studied in thin sections of tissue fixed in buffered osmium tetroxide and embedded in methacrylate. The simple columnar epithelium investing the villus is surmounted by a striated border consisting of slender projections of the cell surface. These microvilli are arranged in almost crystalline, hexagonal array, and increase the apical surface area of the cell by a factor of 24. The core of each microvillus is filled with fine fibrils which arise from the filamentous substance of the terminal web underlying the striated border. Each microvillus is covered by a tubular extension of the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell. Pinocytotic vesicles originating from the plasma membrane occur at the bases of the intermicrovillous spaces. The nucleus, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum of the epithelial cell display no unusual features. Small bits of ergastoplasm occur in the apical cytoplasm. A thin basement membrane separates the epithelium from the lamina propria which consists of vessels, nerves, and numerous lymphocytes, eosinophiles, mast cells, plasma cells, smooth muscle fibers, and macrophages suspended in a delicate stroma of fibroblasts and collagen fibers. Intercellular fat droplets often occur in this stroma, even in animals fasted for 40 hours. The blood capillaries are distinguished by their extremely attenuated, fenestrated endothelial cells. The lacteal has a thicker endothelium which, although not fenestrated, appears to have significant interruptions, especially at the margins between neighboring lining cells. Strands of smooth muscle always accompany the lacteal but do not form an integral part of its wall. Unmyelinated nerves, many of which are too small to be distinguished with the light microscope, course through the lamina propria in association with the vessels. The nerve fibers evidently do not cross the basement membrane into the epithelium. Neuromuscular junctions or other terminal apparatus were not found.

"The flows of sodium, potassium, and chloride under electrical and chemical gradients and of salt and water in the presence of osmotic pressure gradients are described by phenomenological equations based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The aim was to give the simplest possible description, that is to postulate the least number of active transport processes and the least number of separate pathways across the intestine. On this basis, the results were consistent with the following picture of the intestine: Two channels exist across this tissue, one allowing only passive transport of ions and the other only active. In the passive channel, the predominant resistance to ion flow is friction with the water in the channel. The electroosmotic flow indicates that the passive channel is lined with negative fixed charged groups having a surface charge density of 3000 esu cm-2. The values of the ion-water frictional coefficients, and the relationship between ionic concentrations and flows indicate that the passive channel is extracellular. The active channel behaves as two membranes in series, the first membrane being semipermeable but allowing active transport of sodium, and the second membrane being similar to the passive channel. Friction with the ions in the second ""membrane"" is the predominant resistance to water flow."

The fine structure and distribution of tight (zonula occludens) and gap junctions in epithelia of the rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, and duodenum, and in smooth muscle were examined in paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde-fixed, tracer-permeated (K-pyroantimonate and lanthanum), and freeze-fractured tissue preparations. While many pentalaminar and septilaminar foci seen in thin-section and tracer preparations can be recognized as corresponding to well-characterized freeze-fracture images of tight and gap junction membrane modifications, many others cannot be unequivocally categorized—nor can all freeze-etched aggregates of membrane particles. Generally, epithelia of exocrine glands (pancreas and liver) have moderate-sized tight junctions and large gap junctions, with many of their gap junctions basal to the junctional complex. In contrast, the adrenal cortex, a ductless gland, may not have a tight junction but does possess large gap junctions. Mucosal epithelia (epididymis and intestine) have extensive tight junctions, but their gap junctions are not as well developed as those of glandular tissue. Smooth muscle contains numerous small gap junctions The incidence, size, and configuration of the junctions we observed correlate well with the known functions of the junctions and of the tissues where they are found.

The permeability of Sertoli cell tight junctions to lanthanum administered during fixation has been compared in rats after ligation of the ductus deferens and after ligation of the ductuli efferentes. In both control and vasoligated testes, lanthanum penetrated only short distances into the Sertoli cell tight junctions before stopping abruptly. The tight junction, consisting of numerous pentalaminar fusions of contiguous Sertoli cell membranes, prevented diffusion of lanthanum into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. In rats with ligated ductuli efferentes, lanthanum completely permeated many Sertoli cell tight junctions and occupied intercellular spaces of the adluminal compartment. In spite of their newly acquired permeability to lanthanum, tight junctions retained characteristic ultrastructural features, including numerous membrane fusions. When lanthanum-filled tight junctions were sectioned en face, membrane fusions appeared as pale lines in lakes of electron-opaque tracer. These linearly extensive fasciae occludentes occasionally ended blindly, suggesting that lanthanum may have traversed the junction by diffusing around such incomplete barriers. The increased permeability of Sertoli cell tight junctions after efferent ductule ligation, which caused rapid testicular weight gain followed by atrophy, indicates that tight junctions are sensitive to enforced retention of testicular secretions inside the seminiferous tubules. The apparent normalcy of Sertoli cell tight junctions after vasoligation, which had no effect on testis weight, supports the view that blockage of testicular secretions distal to the epididymis is relatively innocuous.

This study was performed to investigate whether the malabsorption of fat in the blind loop syndrome is due to the presence of free bile acids or to a deficiency of conjugated bile salts produced by bacterial degradation of normal bile salts, as well as to learn something of the mechanisms by which bile salts might regulate fat absorption. In the everted gut sac of the rat in vitro, conjugated bile salts were necessary for maximal rates of fatty acid esterification to triglycerides, whereas free bile acids inhibited this process even in the presence of physiologically normal or higher concentrations of conjugated bile salts. In contrast, in the living animal the addition of similar or higher concentrations of free bile acids to infusions of fatty acids in taurocholate micellar solutions produced no reduction in the amount of fatty acid absorbed into lymph or the amount of fatty acid esterified into lymph triglyceride. Both in vitro and in the living animal, reduction in the conjugated bile salt concentration reduced both the rate of fatty acid uptake by the intestine and the esterification into triglycerides. It is concluded that the steatorrhea of the blind loop syndrome or other conditions in which upper intestinal stasis allows bacterial proliferation is not due to presence of increased gut luminal concentrations of free bile acids, but rather is a consequence of lowered concentrations of conjugated bile salts.Images	Bile salt regulation of fatty acid absorption and esterification in rat everted jejunal sacs in vitro and into thoracic duct lymph in vivo	Michael L.

The type and distribution of bacteria in the jejunal juice of patients with a variety of gastrointestinal conditions that might affect the small intestinal flora were examined.Bacterial colonization of the jejunum defined, in this context, as the occurrence of a bile salttolerant flora consisting of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria qualitatively resembling that of faeces, was observed only in patients with some form of blind loop. Prominent among the bacteria isolated from these colonized juices were non-sporing anaerobic bacteria, most usually Bacteroides, able to hydrolyse bile salts.No simple correlation between the patient's fat excretion and bacterial colonization of the jejunum could be demonstrated.

Incubation in vitro of the intestine of the hamster and guinea pig with 5 mM sodium cholate and with 2 mM sodium deoxycholate and sodium chenodeoxycholate resulted in significant morphological changes compared with control incubations. Generally, no major differences were observed between proximal and distal small intestine or between the species used. Only when guinea pig intestine was incubated with 5 mM cholate was less damage found proximally than distally.Perfusion in vivo of the intestine of the hamster and guinea pig with Krebs-Ringer phosphate results in separation of the epithelium from the lamina propria without excessive shedding of epithelial cells from villous tips. This change was also seen in specimens taken before perfusion and probably represents unavoidable trauma during handling of the intestine.In contrast to studies in vitro, regional differences are readily demonstrable with perfusion of bile salts in vivo. Dihydroxy bile salts produce more marked alterations of both proximal and distal small intestine than the trihydroxy bile salt, sodium cholate. Dihydroxy bile salts result in significantly greater alterations in proximal than in distal mucosa.When 5 mM cholate at pH 6·8 is perfused in the guinea pig, absorption occurs approximately 30 times more rapidly from distal than from proximal segments, while in proximal segments 2 mM chenodeoxycholate is absorbed approximately 15 times more rapidly than 5 mM cholate. A correlation is suggested between the morphological alteration produced in the region of the small intestine by a bile acid and the amount of bile salt passing through the cell. Furthermore, it is proposed that the ileal cells may be damaged to a lesser extent by bile acids normally found in that particular species.ImagesFig. 1a and bFig. 2a and bFig. 3a and b	Morphological changes of the small-intestinal mucosa of guinea pig and hamster following incubation in vitro and perfusion in vivo with unconjugated bile salts	Thomas S.

Prior studies have indicated that effects of cholera enterotoxin (CT) on the small intestine are delayed in onset and involve an interaction with adenyl cyclase in the mucosa. It has also been shown that the administration of cycloheximide to rabbits in doses which inhibit crypt cell mitoses (20 mg/kg), diminishes CT-induced fluid production in jejunal loops. These latter studies have been interpreted as indications that CT-related intestinal secretion is a crypt cell function and that it is mediated by a CT-induced protein.The present study was undertaken to delineate more precisely the nature of the interaction in the intestine between cycloheximide and cholera toxin. Pretreatment of rabbits with cycloheximide reduced by 60% the secretory response to CT in isolated ileal loops with intact blood supply. Sodium and chloride flux measurements on mucosa isolated from these and control loops indicated that this antisecretory effect of cycloheximide persists in vitro. Measurements of radioactive leucine incorporation into mucosal protein indicated that the dose of cycloheximide employed inhibited protein synthesis by 90%. This inhibitory effect was shown to be independent of any effect of cycloheximide on amino acid uptake across the brush border. Measurements of adenyl cyclase activity and cyclic AMP levels in ileal mucosa of cycloheximide pretreated and control animals indicated that cycloheximide did not diminish the CT-induced increases in these parameters.These observations demonstrate that cycloheximide reduces CT-induced intestinal fluid production without interfering with the CT-induced augmentation of adenyl cyclase activity or the consequent rise in cyclic. AMP concentration. Since the antisecretory effect of cycloheximide persists in vitro, it probably involves a direct interaction of the antibiotic with mucosal cell ion transport mechanisms rather than an indirect effect mediated by other humoral or neurogenic factors. The present observations also suggest that the secretory response of the intestine to CT involves neither the synthesis of new adenyl cyclase nor that of a protein modifying its activity.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), originally isolated from hog small intestinal mucosa, has been shown to cause small intestinal secretion. More recently, this peptide has been identified in the plasma and tumors of patients with the so-called “pancreatic cholera” syndrome. In order to explore the possible role of VIP in the pathogenesis of this syndrome, we examined the effects of this peptide and other hormones on the cyclic AMP levels, adenylate cyclase activity, and ion transport in in vitro preparations of ileal mucosa. In rabbit ileal mucosa, VIP (20 μg/ml) caused a prompt fivefold increase in cyclic AMP level, whereas nine other hormones, which have been postulated to cause intestinal secretion, failed to exert such an effect. Pentagastrin and glucagon also failed to increase cyclic AMP levels in canine ileal mucosa. An increase in mucosal cyclic AMP levels was observed at a VIP concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and appeared to be nearly maximal at 2.0 μg/ml. VIP (100 μg/ml) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a membrane preparation from rabbit ileal mucosa. Secretin (6.0 × 10-5 M) failed to do so. When added to the serosal side of isolated rabbit ileal mucosa clamped in an Ussing chamber, VIP (2 μg/ml) increased short-circuit current (SCC) and caused net secretion of both Cl and Na. Net Cl secretion exceeded net Na secretion. These effects of VIP on mucosal cyclic AMP metabolism and ion transport are similar to those observed with cholera enterotoxin and certain prostaglandins. VIP was also tested with normal human ileal mucosa. At a concentration of 2 μg/ml it caused a fivefold increase in cyclic AMP level and an increase in SCC of the same magnitude as that caused by 5 mM theophylline. Addition of a second 2-μg/ml dose of VIP and addition of theophylline after VIP produced no further change in SCC. We conclude the VIP stimulates adenylate cyclase and active ion secretion in both rabbit and human ileal mucosa. This may be related to the pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients with the pancreatic cholera syndrome.	Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Stimulation of Adenylate Cyclase and Active Electrolyte Secretion in Intestinal Mucosa	Charles J. Schwartz, Daniel V. Kimberg, Harland E. Sheerin, Michael Field, Sami I.

1. Using a preparation of rat colon mucosa mounted in vitro in small chambers, some factors which influence the electrical properties of the mucosa have been investigated.2. The mucosa behaved mainly as an ohmic resistance although a very brief transient occurred on first passing current. At 32° C, the fresh preparation had a mean resistance of 108Ω/cm2 and a mean short circuit current (s.c.c.) of 143 μA/cm2. Tissues taken from Na-depleted and adrenalectomized rats differed little from normal tissues in electrical resistance but those from Na-depleted rats had higher potential difference (p.d.) and s.c.c.3. Increase of temperature led to a rise of conductance of similar order to that found for ions in aqueous solution. S.c.c. also rose with increase of temperature but the effect was relatively greater consistent with its being dependent on metabolic processes.4. Anoxia or the addition of cyanide, iodoacetate or 2,4-dinitrophenol to the bath fluid caused considerable fall in the p.d. and s.c.c.5. Ouabain decreased the p.d. and s.c.c. when added to the serosal side but had no effect when on the luminal side.6. Aldosterone and acetazolamide had no effect.7. Varying serosal side [K] produced only minor changes in p.d.8. Reducing [Na] of the luminal solution caused a considerable fall of p.d. but similar reduction of [Na] on the serosal side had little effect.9. The frequently employed model which represents the transepithelial p.d. as the sum of diffusion potentials originating at the luminal and serosal sides of the cell layer is not consistent with the present results. The colonic transmucosal p.d. probably originates in the electrogenic transport of Na by a mechanism located on the serosal side of the epithelium.

1. Ascending and descending colonic segments of normal and Na-depleted rats were perfused in vivo with isotonic solutions of varying Na concentration and the unidirectional Na fluxes and secretion rate of K and bicarbonate and the transmucosal electrical p.d. were measured.2. Potential difference was greater in Na-depleted rats, especially towards the distal end of the descending colon. With reduction of luminal Na concentration, p.d. was reduced.3. The ascending and descending segments were similar in regard to Na transport except that the latter had lower passive permeability. Na depletion caused an increase of Na influx rate, Na net flux rate and Na exchange diffusion whilst the mucosal passive Na permeability decreased. These changes resulted in a reduction in the critical luminal Na concentration, i.e. the concentration at which the unidirectional fluxes were equal.4. K secretion rate was similar in the ascending and descending colon and was increased by Na depletion. In all rats, it was reduced when the luminal Na concentration was low.5. Bicarbonate secretion rate was unaffected by the Na depletion and all solutions remained isotonic during perfusion.6. The results confirmed that active Na transport was stimulated by Na depletion but indicated that this was probably not the only factor in the elevation of transmucosal p.d.

"The effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on osmotic water flow across toad bladder and cyclic AMP content of the mucosal epithelial cells has been determined under basal conditions and in the presence of either theophylline or antidiuretic hormone (ADH); Under basal conditions and with PGE1 concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M no evidence of stimulation of water flow was observed, and with 10(-7) M PGE1 a significant inhibition was foundmcyclic AMP content under control conditions was 8 pmol/mg protein. It was 9 at 10(-8) M PGE1, 13 at 10(-7) M, 16 at 10(-6) M, and 23 at 10(-5) M. In the presence of theophylline, 10(-8) and 10(-7) M PGE1 inhibited the theophylline-induced water flow as expected. In contrast, 10(-6) and 10(-5) M PGE1 enhanced the rate of water flow. Theophylline increased cyclic AMP content from 8 to 18 pmol/mg protein. PGE1 in the presence of theophylline caused marked increases in cyclic AMP content; The content was 23 at 10(-7) M, 41 at 10(-6) M, and 130 at 10(-5) M; Thus PGE1 stimulates theophylline-induced water flow at cyclic AMP concentrations somewhere between 23 and 41 pmol/mg. Further evidence along these lines was obtained from experiments in which the effects of PGE1 on ADH-induced water flow were studied. Inhibitory effects of PGE1 were not observed at concentrations of PGE1 which raised the level of intracellular cyclic AMP to 30 pmol/mg protein or higher. These results were obtained despite the fact that all four concentrations of PGE1 tested were found capable of inhibiting ADH-induced water flow under appropriate conditions or, in other words, were inhibiting the adenylate cyclase controlling water flow, Thus the increase in cyclic AMP content in response to PGE1 is not derived from this enzyme. Thus the stimulation of water flow by PGE1 in the presence of theophylline is thought to be caused by cyclic AMP spilling over from one compartment to the water flow compartment. No evidence was obtained to directly suggest spillover into the sodium transport compartment. Furthermore evidence is discussed to suggest that most of the cyclic AMP generated in the tissue does not originate from the enzyme controlling sodium transport. As cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow and sodium transport are thought to occur in one cell type, the granular cells, distinct pools of cyclic AMP are thought to be present in one and the same cell type. Thus one pool controls water flow and one controls sodium transport. With high concentrations of PGE1 in the presence of theophylline or high concentrations of ADH, the adenylate cyclase responsible for water flow is inhibited; However, PGE1 can stimulate a tissue adenylate cyclase to sufficiently high levels that cyclic AMP spills over into the ""water flow compartment"" and thus stimulates water flow.Images"	Stimulation of osmotic water flow in toad bladder by prostaglandin E1.

1. The inhibitory innervation of the taenia of the guinea-pig caecum has been studied, after blocking the responses to stimulation of excitatory cholinergic nerves with atropine.2. Stimulation of the perivascular nerves supplying the taenia caused relaxations. These nerves had properties which were typical of sympathetic post-ganglionic adrenergic nerves. The relaxations caused by stimulation were maximal at frequencies of stimulation above 30 pulses/sec and they were abolished by bretylium, guanethidine and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP).3. The taenia is also innervated by intramural inhibitory nerves with their cell bodies in Auerbach's plexus. These nerves can be excited by electrical stimulation of the taenia or by the application of ganglion-stimulating drugs.4. The intramural inhibitory nerves have different properties from sympathetic adrenergic nerves. Relaxations in response to stimulation were maximal with frequencies of stimulation of about 5 pulses/sec and they were not blocked by bretylium, guanethidine or DMPP.5. Preganglionic cholinergic fibres in the caecal wall make synaptic connexions with the intramural inhibitory neurones.6. The role of the intramural inhibitory neurones in intestinal activity and their possible connexions with the central nervous system have been discussed.

A technique has been described for the demonstration of a human complement component by an immunofluorescent method. The component detected is β1C-globulin, a moiety of the third complement component, which has previously been obtained in pure form and to which a specific antiserum has been prepared. It has been shown in a model system that the binding of β1C-globulin as shown by immunofluorescence is strictly equivalent to complement fixation as assessed by standard serological methods. This technique has been applied to the detection of in vivo bound complement in pathological human tissues. It was found that in vivo complement binding occurs in the lesions of several human diseases, but not elsewhere in the same tissues. In a rather limited survey of diseases that has been carried out, in vivo complement binding was found particularly in systemic L.E., various nephritides, and amyloidosis, as well as in single cases of some other diseases. The spectrum of in vivo complement binding has been compared with that of γ-globulin binding (7S and 19S types) and with the demonstration of in vitro complement fixation and rheumatoid factor fixation. It was distinct from each of these. Rheumatoid factor fixation, detected by anti-19S antiserum showed promise as a method for the detection of antigen-antibody complexes and aggregated γ-globulin in tissue sections. The interpretation of these findings in regard to the nature of the binding sites, and their possible significance in regard to pathogenic mechanisms have been discussed.

Thirteen patients suffering from Crohn's disease or subjected to small bowel resection were studied under metabolic ward conditions for an average of 32 days. Most of these patients had chronic, severe diarrhoea and varying degrees of steatorrhoea. All were studied at two levels of fat intake, 100 g and 40 g daily.After the introduction of the low-fat diet, there was a marked reduction in the faecal excretion of water and sodium in most patients and 10 of them passed solid faeces. Two other subjects improved only after the addition of cholestyramine. In one patient with an ileostomy, no improvement occurred. On the low-fat diet, there was a positive balance of nitrogen and potassium in many cases. Faecal fat excretion decreased, but there was no change in the fractional absorption of fat.The most gratifying improvement was seen in patients with a functioning gallbladder. Previous resection of the colon seemed to limit the reduction of faecal water and sodium excretion which followed the reduction in fat intake.A fat-reduced diet is recommended in the symptomatic therapy of chronic diarrhoea in patients suffering from diseases of the ileum.

This study was performed to investigate the mechanism whereby immediate enteral feeding after burn injury reduces postburn hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism. Fifty-seven burned guinea pigs (30% TBSA) were divided into three groups: A (N = 19), given 175 kcal/kg/day beginning 2 hours after burn; B (N = 20), given 175 kcal/kg/day with an initial 72-hour adaptation period; and C (N = 18), given 200 kcal/kg/day with the same adaptation period as B. Resting metabolic expenditure (RME) on PBD 13 was lowest in group A (109% of preburn level), compared with group B (144%, p less than 0.001) and group C (137%, p less than 0.01). On PBD 1, group A had the greatest jejunal mucosal weight and thickness (p less than 0.001), and mucosal weight had negative correlations with plasma cortisol (r = 0.829, p less than 0.001) and glucagon (r = 0.888, p less than 0.001). Two weeks after burn, urinary vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) excretion, plasma cortisol, and glucagon were lowest in group A (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). These hormones also significantly correlated with RME (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that immediate postburn enteral feeding can prevent hypermetabolism via preservation of gut mucosal integrity and prevention of excessive secretion of catabolic hormones.ImagesFIGS. 3A-C.

Intestinal permeability has been investigated in the normal rat by measuring the five hour urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA after intragastric administration. Twelve control animals excreted 2.06% +/- 0.22 (mean +/- SE) of the administered dose. Prolonged intestinal transit times with atropine had no significant effect on the apparent permeability with a urine excretion 2.31% +/- 0.36. The concomitant administration of a hypertonic, but rapidly absorbed glycerol solution, was accompanied by increased urinary excretion (3.05% +/- 0.33) while the administration of a poorly absorbed sugar, lactulose, significantly decreased the apparent permeability (urine excretion 0.61% +/- 0.14) showing that passive intestinal permeability estimations are affected by test dose composition. Enteropathy was induced by ethanol, cetrimide, or methotrexate and each was associated with increased permeability, with urine excretions of 4.19% +/- 0.47, 4.20% +/- 0.66 and 3.97% +/- 0.49 respectively. It is thus suggested that the normal rat mucosa is maximally resistant to the absorption of foreign compounds such as 51Cr-EDTA and intestinal damage will disrupt this barrier.

Suspensions of isolated epithelial cells (colonocytes) from the human colon were used to assess utilisation of respiratory fuels which are normally available to the colonic mucosa in vivo. Cells were prepared from operative specimens of the ascending colon (seven) and descending colon (seven). The fuels that were used were the short chain fatty acid n-butyrate, produced only by anaerobic bacteria in the colonic lumen, together with glucose and glutamine, normally present in the circulation. The percentage oxygen consumption attributable to n-butyrate, when this was the only substrate, was 73% in the ascending colon and 75% in the descending colon. In the presence of 10 mM glucose these proportions changed to 59% and 72%. Aerobic glycolysis was observed in both the ascending and descending colon. Glucose oxidation accounted for 85% of the oxygen consumption in the ascending colon and 30% in the descending colon. In the presence of 10 mM n-butyrate these proportions decreased to 41% in the ascending colon and 16% in the descending colon. Based on the assumption that events in the isolated colonocytes reflect utilization of fuels in vivo, the hypothesis is put forward that fatty acids of anaerobic bacteria are a major source of energy for the colonic mucosa, particularly of the distal colon.

The development of glomerulonephritis in NZB/W mice is closely related to the formation of antinuclear, particularly anti-DNA, antibodies. The developing inflammatory glomerular lesions are characterized by the deposition of γG- and β1C-globulins plus DNA and possibly other nuclear antigens, presumably as complexes, in a granular to lumpy pattern along the capillary walls and in the mesangia. Elution studies revealed the γG-globulin in the glomeruli to be largely γG2A-type antibody to soluble nuclear antigens. Enhancement of the antinuclear antibody response by active immunization of young NZB/W mice with DNA-methylated BSA hastens the development and increases the severity of the glomerulonephritis. Similarly, injections of soluble DNA into NZB/W mice with circulating anti-DNA antibodies but with as yet little nephritis causes rapid progression of nephritis.

Rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis may show fixation of complement (C') in the glomeruli during two periods. The first period occurs immediately after the injection of the antisera and extends until the host response occurs. The second period is related to the deposit of rat gamma globulin in the glomeruli presumably occurring at the time of the immune response to the heterologous nephrotoxic serum (NTS). This second period terminates about 2 to 3 weeks after injection of NTS, presumably at the time the rat stops making antibodies to the nephrotoxic gamma globulin fixed in the glomeruli. After this period, the glomerular lesion is incapable of fixing detectable amounts of circulating C' unless the antibody response to the heterologous globulin is reactivated. The immunological events which take place in the initial 2 to 3 week period appear to produce a permanent and irreparable lesion in the glomeruli leading to chronic nephritis. Rabbit NTS produces fixation of rat C' during both periods. Duck NTS shows no detectable fixation of rat C' until rat gamma globulin fixes in the glomeruli at the time of the host immune response to the heterologous nephrotoxic gamma globulin. Decomplementation of rats injected with rabbit NTS produces an amelioration of the initial period of nephrotoxic serum nephritis. The fixation of C' in the glomerular lesions was studied with the use of fluorescent antibody methods. The detection of host beta-1C globulin and gamma globulin in the glomerulus pointed to an immune reaction but not necessarily an active one. The tissue C' fixation test using kidney slices and guinea pig C' proved to be a more sensitive method of detecting tissue reactants capable of fixing C', but its relationship to in vivo events is not certain.

RE cultures infected with a fixed rabies virus were studied. The virus can propagate itself in these cells for an indefinite period of time without interfering with cell growth. The present study characterizes this truly endosymbiotic relationship. Virus-specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of each cell by fluorescein-labeled antirabies serum but only 4 to 5 per cent of the cells released infectious virus. All cells undergoing division showed viral antigen throughout the mitotic process. Also, the growth rate, plating efficiency, and morphological characteristics of both the infected and control cultures were identical. No difference was detected between the RE and the RE-CVS cell populations by RNA and DNA labeling experiments, using H3-thymidine, and H3-uridine. Although antirabies serum effectively inhibited the spread of extracellular virus, it did not interfere with cell-to-cell transmission of the virus during mitosis, in the course of 9 cell transfers during 53 days. RE-CVS cells, when exposed to fresh antirabies serum, lysed completely but inactivated serum had no lytic effect. The addition of fresh hamster complement to the inactivated serum restored its cytolytic properties. The serially passaged RE-CVS virus gradually became less virulent for mice and displayed a weak antigenicity in the mouse protection test. Another feature of the RE-CVS cell system is its resistance to infection with homologous and heterologous viruses despite the apparent absence of an interferon-like substance.

The range of relative affinity of antibody to HSA in mice from ten strains is presented. Previously reported high and low affinity strains are not exceptional.Age, sex, dose and time after immunization have little effect on relative affinity of antibody to HSA and HST.Antibodies, raised by injecting DNP-HSA or DNP-RSA, and tested by 3H-εDNP-L-lysine, show similar interstrain differences of affinity. This excludes recognition of only a limited proportion of the diverse antigenic sites on complex protein antigens as the sole explanation of this phenomenon.

The interstrain differences in relative affinity of mouse anti-HSA antibody previously shown by studies at equilibrium are also observed when rates of association and dissociation and avidity indices are measured. Marked differences are demonstrated in the binding characteristics of high and low relative affinity antibody to both protein and hapten antigens. These results are explained on the basis of heterogeneity of antibody-binding affinity.	The antigen-binding characteristics of antibody pools of different relative affinity	M. W. Steward, R. E.

Macrohage function, as measured by carbon clearance, differs in different inbred strains. Low affinity (KR) antibody response to HST is associated either with poor carbon clearance, or slow recovery from carbon blockade by macrophages.Carbon blockade reduces KR, but not Abt in mice with high carbon clearance and KR.Stilboestrol increases carbon clearance and KR in mice with slow clearance and low KR.The significance of these findings in pathogenesis and treatment of chronic soluble complex disease is discussed.

The relationship between certain physicochemical properties of circulating immune complexes and their ability to localize in vessel walls during a state of increased permeability was studied. The ability to become deposited was related to the large size of complexes, rather than to their net charge or to a specific affinity between complexes and structures of vessel walls. Soluble complexes with sedimentation rates greater than 19S were capable of being entrapped along the vessel wall membranes, while complexes smaller than this were not. These large complexes were removed rapidly from the circulation, while smaller complexes persisted. Minimal levels of total complexes in the circulation necessary for detectable vascular localization were found to be as low as 15 µg antibody N/ml plasma. In experimental serum sickness, a disease known to be induced by circulating immune complexes, the development of vascular and glomerular lesions occurred almost exclusively in rabbits having large (greater than 19S) circulating immune complexes. Animals with smaller complexes did not show deposition of complexes in glomeruli or development of glomerulonephritis. Their incidence of vasculitis was markedly reduced.

Three of 16 rabbits injected (intravenously) daily with crystalline bovine serum albumin (BSA) for periods in excess of 10 wk developed chronic glomerulonephritis. In vivo, animals with chronic proteinuria formed variable quantities of soluble complex after injection of antigen while animals without proteinuria exhibited rapid removal of the injected BSA. In vitro studies demonstrated that a major part of the antibodies produced by rabbits with chronic nephritis lacked precipitating properties. Interpretations of these observations were presented in the discussion. It is suggested that, in addition to quantity, quality of antibody plays an important role in the development of chronic serum sickness. Complexes formed with nonprecipitating antibody, which are less rapidly removed from circulation, would have a greater opportunity to deposit in glomeruli and induce inflammation.

A minority of rabbits immunized daily with soluble preparations of heterologous serum albumin respond with the formation of non-precipitating antibodies. Precipitating and non-precipitating antibodies, in the present study, were similar with regard to electrophoretic distribution, molecular size, and elution appearing on DEAE Sephadex. Guinea-pig antisera against purified non-precipitating antibodies did not recognize unique antigenic determinants. The present studies suggest that non-precipitating antibodies result from a limited recognition of multiple antigenic determinants on complex antigens.ImagesFIG. 5FIG. 6	Character of non-precipitating antibodies	C.

Solid phase immunoadsorbents were prepared by coupling antigens to agarose. With this technique specific antibodies were easily isolated in large amounts. The γG-globulin class of antibodies isolated in this manner were not denatured as judged by their normal biological half-life in rabbits. Soluble immune complexes at fivefold antigen excess were prepared from isolated specific antibodies and HSA, human λ-chains, human λG-globulins, and a Waldenström's macroglobulin as antigens. In all these preparations a characteristic immune complex was encountered that represented the smallest stable antigen-antibody union. In the HSA-anti-HSA system they were found to be AgAb2 complexes, and Ag2Ab complexes in the γG-anti-γG system. These stable complexes fixed complement ineffectively. Also, a spectrum of larger complexes was present in each system, and these complexes fixed complement effectively. With intact antibodies the disappearance curves of immune complexes from the circulation were composed of three exponential components. The immune complexes larger than AgAb2 were quickly removed from the circulation with half-lives of 0.09–0.37 hr. Their clearance was not dependent on complement components, in that depletion of complement by cobra venom factor and aggregated γG-globulin did not alter the pattern of their removal from the circulation. However, when the interchain disulfide bonds of antibodies were reduced and alkylated, the removal of the λ-anti-λ, HSA-anti-HSA, and γG-anti-γG complexes was altered. In these experiments the disappearance curves were composed of two exponential components and the rapid removal of the greater than AgAb2 complexes did not occur. The immune complexes prepared from reduced and alkylated antibodies fixed complement ineffectively. The presented data indicate that the rapid removal of circulating immune complexes, containing γG-globulin molecules as antibodies, depends primarily on the number of antibodies involved. Furthermore, complement fixation is not involved in the rapid removal of such complexes. Nevertheless, the rapid removal of immune complexes and their ability to fix complement have similarities for optimal function in that both processes require intact interchain disulfide bonds of antibodies and complexes that exceed the AgAb2 combination.

The level and avidity of anti-DNA antibody in the serum of New Zealand Black/White (NZB/W F1) hybrid mice has been determined. The results show that there is an age and sex-related variation in the avidity of this antibody. In mice of both sexes, the avidity of circulating anti-DNA antibody increases up to 5 months of age; thereafter the avidity falls with increasing age. These variations are more marked in males, but female mice consistently have lower avidity anti-DNA antibody than males. Thus the time of onset, time course and severity of the murine lupus syndrome in NZB/W F1 mice are associated with the presence of increasing levels of low avidity anti-DNA antibody in the serum. These results are discussed in the context of the possible role of low avidity antibody in immune complex disease.	The role of low affinity antibody in immune complex disease.

New Zealand mice—NZB, NZW and NZB/W F1 hybrids—were immunized with human serum transferrin in saline. The number of responder animals, levels and relative affinity of the antibody produced to this antigen were determined. Distinct trends in those immunologic parameters were noted with strain, sex and age at immunization. The relative affinity of the antibodies produced by the strains was lower than that previously demonstrated for several other inbred mouse strains. These results are discussed with reference to the spontaneous soluble complex disease developed by the New Zealand mice.	Relative affinity of anti-protein antibodies in New Zealand mice	R. E.

Two types of light polypeptide chain (κ and λ) are present in guinea pig immunoglobulins. The ratios of K/L molecules in anti-hapten antibodies differ sometimes markedly from that found in normal serum. Anti-DNP antibodies and anti-pipsyl antibodies have, respectively, a higher and a lower than normal K/L ratio. The possibility that the L chain type affects the range of configurations which the antibody-combining site may assume was investigated. Fractional precipitation of anti-DNP antibodies from serum of guinea pigs immunized with DNP44-BSA was performed using limiting amounts of antigen. Antibody fractions were purified from each precipitate, their affinities for ε-DNP-L-lysine measured by fluorescence quenching (K0) and the K/L ratio estimated by precipitation with specific antisera. Increasing concentrations of L molecules were found in fractions with decreasing K0. In other experiments, fractional precipitation and purification of antibodies which cross-react with DNP was performed in serum of animals immunized with pipsyl-BGG. The K/L ratio in antibodies isolated from these fractions was much higher than in fractions which do not cross-react with DNP. These results show that K molecules are better adapted to react with the DNP hapten than L molecules. The K/L ratio in anti-DNP antibody was shown to increase in the course of immunization, at the same time that the K0 is increasing. This rise in K0 is markedly delayed when larger doses of antigen are employed.	ANTIHAPTEN ANTIBODY SPECIFICITY AND L CHAIN TYPE	Victor Nussenzweig, Baruj Benacerraf	4168100	1967-10-01	15	
The presence of viruses was sought in a colony of dogs bred from parents with systemic lupus crythematosus (SLE). Cell-free filtrates prepared from the spleens of these animals were injected into newborn dogs, mice, and rats. The canine recipients developed antinuclear antibody (ANA) and positive lupus erythematosus (LE) cell tests: ANA and, in some cases, antinative DNA antibodies were produced by the murine recipients: no abnormalities were detected in the rats. Serial passage of spleen cells or cell-free filtrates of spleen tissue in syngeneic mice reduced the time required for appearance of ANA from 9 to 4 mo. Some murine recipients of the canine filtrate developed malignant lymphomas. Murine leukemia viruses were identified in these tumors by electron microscopic, virologic, and serologic technics. These neoplasms, but not other tumors known to contain murine leukemia viruses, were associated with the production of ANA. Puppies inoculated with the canine filtrate-induced mouse lymphoma developed ANA and positive LE cell tests within 4 mo.The results were interpreted to indicate the presence in canine SLE of a virus capable of: (a) inducing the serologic abnormalities of SLE in normal dogs and mice: (b) activating latent murine leukemia viruses: and (c) spreading by both horizonal and vertical routes.Images	Canine Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

The specificities of anti-RNA antibodies of diverse origin were studied by inhibition of the binding of radioative polyinosinic polycytidylic acid. The antibodies were from human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), older NZB/NZW F1 mice who have SLE, and young NZB/NZW F1 mice immunized with either synthetic or viral double-stranded (ds) RNA. The inhibitors were two viral ds and two synthetic ds RNAs, ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. The human sera were more heterogeneous than the mouse lupus sera, and had greatest specificity for reovirus RNA. The mouse lupus sera were more homogeneous and, in general, were inhibited efficiently by all four ds RNAs. Sera from mice immunized with synthetic RNA reacted poorly with viral RNA, whereas sera from mice immunized with viral RNA reacted with all four ds RNAs and resembled the lupus sera. These results suggest a role for viruses in the induction of anti-RNA antibodies, and are compatible with the concept that virus infection as well as excessive antibody responses are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE.

NZB mice were found to produce natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody in high prevalence and antibody titre. This autoantibody in NZB mice was detectable by the cytotoxicity test at both 4°C and 37°C; the prevalence and antibody titre were generally higher at 4°C. Mice of other strains also produced natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody although in lower prevalence and antibody titre and in some instances the activity was greater at 37°C than at 4°C. Natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody in NZB mice reacted equally with the thymocytes of virtually all strains of mice tested but to a lesser degree with the thymocytes of SJL/J mice. A serum pool obtained from old NZB mice had an extremely high titre of natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody (1:1024 at 4°C). Nevertheless, the cells in lymph nodes, spleen and blood leucocytes were only partially sensitive to this serum pool, and bone marrow cells were for the most part negative. By absorption, the antigen reacting with natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody was found in thymus, lymph node, spleen and brain of adult mice, thymus of newborn mice and some leukaemias. Natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody in NZB mice was an IgM-globulin as determined by sensitivity to 2-mercaptoethanol treatment and by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography in contrast to other natural antibodies (antinuclear, antierythrocyte and G antibodies) of IgG-globulin class. NZB mice also produced natural antibodies against thymocytes of the rat and the hamster; these antibodies were species-specific and did not react with the thymocytes of any but the homologous species.

The specificities of anti-polynucleotide antibodies found in human sera were studied using several immunological procedures. Anti-native DNA (NDNA) antibodies and certain anti-double-stranded RNA (DSRNA) antibodies were found to react with single-stranded DNA (SDNA), and anti-NDNA antibodies were observed to react more avidly with SDNA than with NDNA in most sera tested. Antibodies to NDNA showed no preferential reactivity with NDNA or SDNA derived from mammalian tissue, bacterial, or viral sources. Precipitating antibodies reactive with individual bases, with common determinants of bases, and with common determinants of SDNA and NDNA were detected utilizing synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides. Antibodies to DSRNA were also heterogeneous and reactive with both Poly A · Poly U and Poly I · Poly C in addition to reactivity with Poly A and SDNA. In contrast, antibodies to a ribonucleo-protein determined by hemagglutination and by precipitation showed no reaction with NDNA, SDNA, or DSRNA. Serial studies of serum specimens from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) indicated that anti-NDNA antibodies were closely associated with disease activity. Titers of antibodies to SDNA or DSRNA were also frequently increased during these periods but in addition showed peaks during quiescent periods. Anti-NDNA antibodies were detected in most patients' sera at sometime during the course of the disease. Three patients were observed with active SLE, who did not develop anti-NDNA antibodies, even in the presence of severe renal disease. Evidence that other antigen-antibody systems may also play a role in the pathogenesis of the renal disease was particularly apparent in these patients. Anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies were not well correlated with the peaks of antibody activity of other polynucleotide antibodies, suggesting that an independent immunogen was responsible for induction of these antibodies. The close association of certain populations of anti-polynucleotide antibodies during the course of active SLE, the presence of cross-reacting antigenic determinants of SDNA, NDNA, and DSRNA, the preferential avidity of anti-NDNA antibodies for SDNA, and the frequent increase of anti-SDNA antibodies in SLE and other diseases associated with active tissue destruction suggest that SDNA is a ubiquitous antigen that may stimulate the formation of antibodies reactive with a variety of polynucleotides.

NZB and NZB/NZW (B/W) mice were studied for natural thymocytoxic autoantibody(NTA) and antibody to reovirus RNA by cytotoxicity and radioimmunoassay respectively.NZB mice developed NTA by 2-3 months of age.  RNA antibodies appeared later if atall.  NTA and anti-RNA were present in B/W mice starting at 4-5 months and increased in frequency with age.  Either activity could appear first and could be present without the other.  Thus, all four possible patterns of autoantibody occurrence were found.  NTA and anti-RNA in 12-month B/W sera were separable by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation; NTA is a 19S IgM antibody whereas anti-RNA is 7S.

Cultured human lymphoid cells sensitized with human histocompatibility (HL-A) antibodies were able to activate the human complement system in vitro. Some HL-A alloantisera selectively activated the alternate complement pathway while other antisera activated only the classical pathway. A third group of alloantisera was equally able to initiate complement action by way of either pathway. The mechanism of complement activation did not correlate with the HL-A antigen present on the cells or the HL-A specificity of the alloantisera, indicating that the antigenic determinants or distribution on the cell surface play on direct role in selecting the pathway of activation. In this completely homologous system the alternate pathway was found to have the same cytolytic potential as the classical pathway. Thus, an altered or damaged membrane is not a prerequisite for the production of cytolytic damage by the alternate pathway. A complete understanding of the mechanism of interaction of membrane bound antigens and antibodies with the complement system may provide a versatile tool for the investigation of membrane antigen expression.Images	Activation of Human Complement by Human Lymphoid Cells Sensitized with Histocompatibility Alloantisera*	S.

Nephritic factor (C3NeF) has been isolated from plasma of patients with hypocomplementemic chronic glomerulonephritis (HCG) by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. This material was further treated with solidified anti-Ig antiserum. The purified material failed to react with antiserum to human IgG, IgG3, Fab, Fc, and kappa and lambda chains, but retained full C3NeF activity. The nonidentity of C3NeF with IgG was further demonstrated by Ouchterlony analysis using anti-IgG and anti-C3NeF. Isolated C3NeF was found to be a protein with a sedimentation coefficient of 7S and a mol wt of 150,000 daltons, which on microzone electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6 behaved as a γ-globulin. C3NeF is not a C1q precipitin and does not activate the classical complement pathway. Unlike cobra venom factor, it failed to enter into a complex with C3 proactivator (C3PA) when incubated with normal human serum (NHS) and then subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The action of isolated C3NeF on C3 requires C3PA, C3PA convertase (C3PAse), and properdin (P). Similarly, C3PA conversion by C3NeF requires P, C3PAse, and C3. Total hemolytic activity was lost by incubation of 64 µg of C3NeF/1 ml NHS at 37°C for 30 min. Both C3a and C5a anaphylatoxin could be generated by C3NeF in serum previously depleted of anaphylatoxin inactivator. Anti-C3NeF was found to detect an antigen in all NHS tested. Treatment of NHS with solidified anti-C3NeF caused impairment of the alternate complement pathway. It failed to sustain lysis of glutathione-treated human erythrocytes initiated by inulin. It is conceivable that the normal serum constituent which is removed by anti-C3NeF constitutes the inactive precursor of C3NeF, and a heretofore unrecognized component of the alternate pathway.

AKR/J (H-2kk) mice have higher serum C3 levels than DBA/2J (H-2dd). The F1 hybrids have intermediate levels. Analysis of the progeny of backcrosses at 21 days of age shows that C3 levels in mice of H-2dk type are significantly higher than those with H-2dd type and lower than those with H-2kk type. In addition, mice of H-2kk, H-2dk, and H-2dd types have C3 levels not significantly different from those of AKR/J, AKD2F1, and DBA/2J respectively. These findings demonstrate linkage between a gene controlling C3 levels and the H-2 complex.

Five pediatric patients who were known to be previously healthy acutely developed lymphopenia during various viral or mycoplasma infections. In one case, fatal generalized varicella occurred and in another, severe toxic epidermal necrolysis ensued.To further investigate this phenomenon, a study was done to determine the incidence of and elucidate the pathogenesis of lymphopenia occurring during the acute phase of viral or mycoplasma infections. Acute and convalescent sera from patients with viral or mycoplasma infection and children immunized with live measles virus were screened for lymphocytotoxic activity against normal lymphocytes by the microcytotoxicity method of Terasaki and McClelland (1). Sera with lymphocytotoxic activity were found in 15 of 48 cases of viral infections, 4 of 22 mycoplasma infections, and 1 of 11 measles virus immunized persons. All those who had sera which were cytotoxic to lymphocytes in vitro had lymphopenia. The lymphocytotoxic activity resided in 19S fractions in 8 of 11 positive sera while the remaining 3 had activity both in 19S and 7S fractions and could be completely removed by absorption with antilight chain antiserum. The cytotoxic activities were all complement-dependent and were greater at 37°C than at 4°C.The significance of acute acquired immunologic deficiency due to the development of antibody-associated lymphotoxin (AbAL) during acute infections is discussed and five cases having more severe clinical manifestations are presented (Appendix).

42 human sera showing in vitro cytotoxic activity of restricted or broad HL-A specificities with test human lymphocytes were studied for the molecular and immunoglobulin class of cytotoxic antibody using sucrose gradient separations, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Sera originated from patients with previous multiple pregnancies (19), multiply transfused patients (8), subacute bacterial endocarditis (4), systemic lupus (2), and human umbilical cord sera (9). In 32 of 42 instances, predominant cytotoxic activity was found in high molecular weight gradient fractions; however, DEAE chromatographic separations revealed cytotoxic activity in initial buffer fractions containing primarily γG globulin. Gradient separations of cytotoxic activity within initial γG DEAE fractions showed localization of cytotoxicity only in high molecular weight materials. Confirmation of high molecular weight γG cytotoxic activity was obtained by resistance to mercaptoethanol treatment, abolition of activity after absorption only with specific anti-γG antisera, and by the finding that high molecular weight cytotoxic activity in gradients or gel filtration run at neutral pH 7.4 became 7S when separations were rerun at an acidic pH of 4.0. Such 7S activity again became rapidly sedimenting when the same fractions were again rerun in gradients at neutral pH.19S γM cytotoxic activity was documented in a panel of 15 human sera containing anti-“I” cold agglutinins. In this instance the cytotoxic activity appeared to be related to the cold agglutinin antibody since it was mercaptoethanol sensitive and could be demonstrated in monoclonal antibody eluates containing primarily γM.No in vitro protection again cytotoxic effect was demonstrated when isolated human 19S anti-γ-globulins were aded to the lymphocytotoxic assay system.With the exception of cold agglutinins, human cytotoxic antibodies appear to be primarily γG producing in vitro lymphocyte killing either as 7S γG globulin or as rapidly sedimenting aggregates or complexes of γG molecules.Images	Studies of human sera with cytotoxic activity	Ralph C.

A model system for the investigation of immune cellular injury in primary isolates of a fixed-tissue cell of human origin has been described, using metabolism-inhibition and uptake of trypan blue as independent criteria of cytoxicity. Cytotoxic effects on human amnion cells were produced by the combination of specific rabbit antibody and factors in normal human serum which were indistinguishable from the components of hemolytic complement and calcium and magnesium ions. The data have been discussed in relation to the apparent multiplicity of serologic systems which can effect cellular injury. The nature of the cell and the source of antibody or normal serum constituents have been emphasized as factors which may influence the experimental selection of a given humoral mechanism.

1. Fluorescence quenching has been calibrated, by comparison with equilibrium dialysis, for measurement of antibody-hapten association constants with guinea pig antibody to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) determinant. The maximum quenching with all sites occupied which gave best agreement with equilibrium dialysis was found to be 100%. 2. The carrier to which the DNP-hapten is coupled influences significantly the amount, class (γ1 or γ2), and affinity of the antibody of DNP specificity made by individual guinea pigs. 3. The affinities of γ1- and γ2-antibodies from individual guinea pigs are generally very similar. 4. Precipitin curves with γ1-antibodies show more marked inhibition of precipitation in antigen excess than do precipitin curves with the less charged γ2-antibodies, indicating the importance of nonspecific forces in the precipitation reactions.

The response of strain 2 guinea pigs to limiting doses of bovine serum albumin is under dominant genetic control linked with the poly-L-lysine gene. Inbred strains 2 and 13 guinea pigs make similar antibody responses to 10 μg bovine serum albumin, whereas strain 2 but not strain 13 animals produce significant amounts of antibodies in response to 0.1 μg. The relationship between the presence of the poly-L-lysine gene and the ability to respond to limiting doses of bovine serum albumin has also been investigated in random-bred Hartley strain guinea pigs.

Preimmunization of either guinea pigs or rabbits to bovine gamma globulin (BGG) prepares the animals for markedly enhanced antibody responses to 2,4-dinitrophenyl-BGG (DNP-BGG). This phenomenon is observed both in the primary anti-DNP antibody response to DNP-BGG and in the secondary anti-DNP antibody response to DNP-BGG in animals primed with DNP-ovalbumin (DNP-OVA). The BGG preimmunization is most effective if the antigen is administered as a complete Freund's adjuvant emulsion; in rabbits, a dose of 1 µg of BGG is more effective than a dose of 50 µg, whereas the reverse is true in guinea pigs. Transfusion of homologous anti-BGG sera fails to replace active immunization with BGG in the preparation of animals for these enhanced anti-DNP antibody responses. Both the immunoglobulin class and the average association constant for ε-DNP-L-lysine of the anti-DNP antibody produced in these enhanced responses is determined by the mode and time of immunization with haptenic conjugates and is not appreciably influenced by the nature of the carrier preimmunization. These studies indicate that the carrier specificity of hapten-specific anamnestic antibody responses is largely due to the interaction of two independent cell associated recognition units, one specialized for carrier and the other specific for haptenic determinants.

To determine the tissue localization of lymphocytes provisionally termed „complement-receptor lymphocytes,” which are characterized by having a membrane receptor for antigen-antibody-complement complexes, we investigated the adherence of sensitized and nonsensitized sheep red cells to frozen sections of mouse lymphoid organs. Nonsensitized erythrocytes became bound exclusively to sinus-lining cells of spleen and lymph nodes, whereas erythrocytes sensitized with antibody and complement adhered to lymphocytes in the follicular areas and the marginal zone of the spleen and in the true cortex of lymph nodes. However, the doubly sensitized erythrocytes failed to bind to the „thymus-dependent” areas of peripheral lymphoid organs or to the thymus itself. We suggest that complement-receptor lymphocytes are of extrathymic origin and that they contribute substantially to follicular antigen localization, which appears to be complement-dependent.Images	Tissue Localization of Lymphocytes Bearing a Membrane Receptor for Antigen-Antibody-Complement Complexes	Peter Dukor, Celso Bianco, Victor Nussenzweig	5289036	1970-10-01	15	
Injection of rabbits with Freund's complete adjuvant containing bovine γ-globulin substituted to near saturation with dinitrophenyl groups leads to the production of large amounts of antibodies specific for the 2,4-dinitrophenyl substituent. These antibodies can be isolated from sera in satisfactory yield (40 per cent) and in a high state of purity (90 per cent specifically precipitable). Hapten dissolution, which was used to screen haptens for their potential usefulness as specific reagents in the purification procedure, provides a means for evaluating, in relative terms, antibody-hapten affinities (in competition with antigen).

Sheep red blood cells sensitized by 7S, but not by 19S rabbit anti-Forssman antibodies, adhere and form rosettes on mouse macrophages and on a few monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). When, however, C' factors from mouse serum are added to the antigen-19S antibody complex (EAC'), rosettes are formed on most mouse peritoneal macrophages and PMN and on a few monocytes. In addition EAC' also adheres to 10–25% of lymph node lymphocytes but not to thymus lymphocytes. EAC' prepared with 7S anti-Forssman antibodies has identical properties. The adherence of red cells induces an increase in the membrane activity of the leukocytes and causes injury to the red cells which rapidly become deformed and fragmented. Adherence of EAC' occurs at 37°C and is minimal at 4°C. Probably only the first four C' components are involved in this phenomenon as mouse serum deficient in C'5 or rabbit serum, deficient in C'6 can be used as a source of C' components. Treatment of EAC' with EDTA does not modify its leukocyte-adherence properties. The adherence of EAC' to the leukocytes is not inhibited in the presence of serum. The receptors for C' on macrophages, PMN, and monocytes differ from those found on lymphocytes. Rosette formation by EAC' on macrophages, PMN, and monocytes depends on divalent cations (Mg++) and can be reversed by Na3H EDTA, while adherence to lymphocytes is independent of these ions and occurs in the presence of 0.01 M Na3H EDTA. Both types of receptors for C' components are destroyed by trypsin treatment of the leukocytes, in contrast with the receptors for 7S antibodies on the same cells which persist after enzyme treatment.

Mouse spleen cells were found to associate in cell clusters during the primary immune response to sheep erythrocytes in vitro. About 10% of the cell clusters had the following unique properties; (a) they contained most, if not all, antibody-forming cells, (b) they contained only cells forming antibody to one antigen when cell cultures were immunized with two antigens, (c) the cells in clusters reaggregated specifically after dispersion, and (d) the specific reaggregation of clusters appeared to be blocked by antibody to the antigen. The integrity of cell clusters was required for the proliferation of antibody-forming cells, and prevention of clustering by mechanical means or by excess antibody blocked the immune response. Antibody and antigenic determinants on the surfaces of cells probably provide the basis for interaction. The unique microenvironment of cell clusters was essential for the primary immune response in vitro.

"Tissue cultures with two compartments, separated by a cell impermeable nuclepore membrane (1 µ pore size), were used to investigate the mechanism of T-B lymphocyte cooperation. It was found that collaboration was as effective when the T and B lymphocyte populations were separated by the membrane as when they were mixed together. Critical tests were performed to verify that the membranes used were in fact cell impermeable. The specificity of the augmentation of the B cell response by various T cell populations was investigated. Only the response of B cells reactive to determinants on the same molecule as recognized by the T cells was augmented markedly. Specific activation of thymocytes by antigen was necessary for efficient collaboration across the membrane. The response of both unprimed and hapten-primed spleen cells was augmented by the T cell ""factor"" although, as expected, hapten-primed cells yielded greater responses. The T cell factor acted as efficiently if T cells were present or absent in the lower chamber. Thus the site of action of the T cell factor was not on other T cells, but was either on macrophages or the B cells themselves. The T cell-specific immunizing factor did not pass through dialysis membranes. The experiments reported here help rule out some of the possible theories of T-B cell collaboration. Clearly T-B cell contact was not necessary for successful cooperation to occur in this system. Possible theoretical interpretations of the results and their bearing on the detailed mechanism of T-B lymphocyte cooperation are discussed."	CELL INTERACTIONS IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN VITRO III.

It has been proposed that two distinct signals are required for the triggering of the precursors of antibody-forming bone marrow-derived cells (B cells): (a) the binding of antigen or of a mitogen to the corresponding receptor sites on B-cell membranes and (b) the interaction of activated C3 with the C3 receptor of B lymphocytes. There is growing evidence that B-cell mitogens and T (thymus-derived cell)-independent antigens are capable of activating the alternate pathway of the complement system (bypass). Therefore, the effect of another potent bypass inducer was investigated with regard to B-cell activation and the role of C3. Purified, pyrogen-free cobra venom factor was mitogenic for both T and B lymphocytes (cortisone-resistant mouse thymus cells and lymph node lymphocytes from congenitally athymic mice). Venom factor could substitute for T cells by restoring the potential of antibody formation to sheep red blood cells in mouse B-cell cultures supplemented with macrophages or 2-mercaptoethanol. Venom factor may be capable of conferring activated C3 to the C3 receptor of B lymphocytes: preincubation of lymphoid cells with homologous serum or plasma, 10 mM EDTA, and sepharose-coupled venom factor converted with serum to an enzyme active against C3, inhibited their capacity to subsequently form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes sensitized with amboceptor and C5-deficient mouse complement. In the absence of EDTA, preincubation of freshly prepared B-cell suspensions with C3-sufficient homologous serum also blocked their subsequent interaction with complement-sensitized erythrocytes and at the same time rendered them reactive to an otherwise T-cell-specific mitogen. Moreover, mitogen induced B-cell proliferation in lymph node (but not in spleen) cell cultures, appeared to depend on the availability of exogenous C3: zymosan-absorbed fetal bovine serum (only 8.3% site-forming units remaining) supported T-cell activation by phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and venom factor, but failed to sustain B-cell stimulation by pokeweed mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, and venom factor. T-cell-dependent antibody formation in composite cultures containing T cells or T-cell-substituting B-cell mitogens, B cells, and macrophages, always required the presence of C3-sufficient serum.

Double diffusion in agarose was employed for the characterization of a soluble nucleoprotein antigen that gave precipitin reactions with sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The soluble antigen that was isolated from calf thymus nuclei was demonstrated by enzyme degradation and ultracentrifugation studies, and by immunologic analysis, to be a complex of deoxyribonucleic acid and a moiety susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Antibody to soluble nucleoprotein did not react with the DNA portion of the complex released after proteolytic digestion or with purified calf thymus DNA. Immunologic reaction of identity was obtained between the soluble nucleoprotein antigen and synthesized DNA-histone complex, suggesting that the protein moiety of soluble nucleoprotein might in part be composed of histone. Antibody to soluble nucleoprotein was present in 51% of systemic lupus erythematosus sera examined and was more common than antibody to deoxyribonucleic acid.Images	An Immunologic Precipitin System between Soluble Nucleoprotein and Serum Antibody in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus*	Eng M.

Using a hemagglutination test which can detect antibodies to (a) native and denatured deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and (b) an extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), a comparative study of patterns of autoantibody formation has been done in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and related rheumatic diseases. Antibody to native DNA was present in the serum in 96% of patients with active SLE and disappeared during remissions. Antibody to ENA was found in 86% of those patients with SLE nephritis who responded to treatment but in only 8% of those who did not. The highest titers of antibody to ENA were found in patients having a mixed connective tissue disease syndrome with features of SLE, scleroderma, and myositis. The latter syndrome was notable for the absence of renal disease and for a striking responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy. Hemagglutination testing of 277 sera from normal persons and patients with a wide variety of acute diseases other than SLE revealed the presence of antibody to native DNA in only 1.4% and antibody to ENA in only 0.4%.These results yield significant correlations among the pattern of autoimmune reactivity, the clinical form of the rheumatic disease, and responsiveness to treatment. They implicate the qualitative nature of the patient's immune response as a conditioning factor in the type of disease. Together with other correlations they may allow classification of rheumatic diseases into more biologically meaningful groups and lead to more selective methods of therapy.

A soluble preparation of nucleoprotein (sNP), a complex of native deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histones, was isolated from calf thymus nuclei and labeled with [125I]iodide. Isotope-labeled antigen ([125I]sNP) was used in a primary binding radioimmunoassay method to detect antibodies to both sNP and native DNA. Sera with antibody to native DNA reacted with the DNA moiety of sNP and bound [125I] sNP, but this binding was completely inhibited by addition of unlabeled native DNA. Antibody to sNP which reacted with DNA-histone complex was not inhibited in the radioimmunoassay by addition of unlabeled DNA. Thus, antibodies to sNP and native DNA could be detected and differentiated by use of a single isotopically labeled antigen. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sera with binding to [125I]sNP was present in 21/36 (58%) patients. The majority (18/21) had antibodies to sNP and native DNA present simultaneously, one had antibody only to sNP and two had antibody only to DNA. In contrast, patients with other connective tissue diseases rarely showed binding to [125I]sNP. Serial studies on SLE patients showed that high serum binding to [125I]sNP paralleled renal disease activity as reflected by the degree of proteinuria. A fall in binding was observed with subsidence of renal disease and reappearance of increased binding coincided with exacerbation. In these patients, antibodies to sNP and DNA appeared or disappeared pari passu suggesting that in addition to the previously demonstrated role of antibody to native DNA, antibody to sNP might also be implicated in the pathogenesis of immunologically-mediated tissue lesions such as SLE nephritis.Images	Relationship between Deoxyribonucleoprotein and Deoxyribonucleic Acid Antibodies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	Pierre Robitaille, Eng M.

In both C'1q protein and agglutination assays, markedly reduced mean titres (27 and <10% normal, respectively) were observed in Swiss type lymphopenic agammaglobulinaemia. Mean C'1q titres were somewhat decreased in other forms of agammaglobulinaemia, but not to the same degree (78 and 46% normal, respectively). C'1q titres were normal or elevated in other diseases associated with repeated infections and malignancy.We conclude that the C'1q globulins, like the immunoglobulins, characteristically are deficient in agammaglobulinaemia syndromes. Since the greatest C'1q deficiencies were seen in lymphopenic agammaglobulinaemia of the Swiss type, titration of C'1q seems to be a convenient aid in diagnosing this disease early in life.Thus, the inborn error of agammaglobulinaemia seems to be reflected in the complement system.

This report demonstrates that complement and classical complement component activities are detectable by standard haemolytic methods in foetal porcine serum as early as the 40th day of the 115–120 gestational period. At this stage of development only miniscule amounts of immunoglobulins are detectable in the serum. Complement activity equal to that of the adult pig is present in the serum of the piglet at 1 week of age. Pig colostrum, from which lipids were removed, contained large amounts of haemolytic C′1, C′2 and classical C′3 as well as C′1q protein and C′1q agglutinating activity. It is of major interest that the activities of C′1q, haemolytic C′1 and C′2 are five to thirty times higher in suckling than in age matched non-suckling piglets. These observations suggest that biologically active complement proteins are transferred from the colostrum through the intestine to the piglet protein pool.ImagesFIG. 1FIG. 2	Ontogenetic development of the complement system	Noorbibi K.

The experiments presented here utilize a human serum markedly deficient in hemolytic complement activity to show that: (a) The hemolytic deficiency is the result of a selective deficiency in hemolytic C1. (b) The relative absence of hemolytic C1 is due to a profound deficit in C1r function associated with less than normal C1s protein and hemolytic function and normal C1q protein concentration and function. This deficit in C1r in the face of normal C1q suggests that different cell types are responsible for the synthesis of each of these components. (c) Whatever the basis for the deficiency of C1r function, this defect results in an inadequate association of the remaining C1 subcomponents, C1q and C1s, even in the presence of calcium ions, thus suggesting that C1r has an important role in the assembly and/or maintenance of macromolecular C1.

Kidney tissue from 97 patients was studied by immunofluorescent techniques using antiserum to purified properdin. All patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis showed deposition of properdin and the third component of complement (C3), either as “humps” on the basement membrane, or in the mesangium. In all cases of chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, properdin and C3 were localized in the glomeruli, most commonly in a lobular pattern on the basement membrane. Activation of C3 by the properdin system may explain the depressed serum levels of C3 and terminal complement components even though levels of earlier components are normal, and the deposition of C3, often without immunoglobulins, in the kidneys of patients with acute glomerulonephritis or chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.Images	Glomerular deposition of properdin in acute and chronic glomerulonephritis with hypocomplementemia	N.

A method to obtain C1r, a subunit of the first complement component, in a highly purified state has been described for the first time. The stepwise method starts with a neutral euglobulin precipitation, after diethylaminoethyl- and carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography and a final preparative polyacrylamide electrophoresis step. Such C1r preparations are devoid of C1q and C1s activities and show only one protein band on analytic polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Rabbits injected with this preparation produced antisera showing only one precipitation band. The stability of C1r activity was determined under different conditions, and C1r was found to be labile at 37°C, pH 7-8 and low ionic strength.The electrophoretic mobility of purified C1r is that of a β-globulin on disc acrylamide electrophoresis and on agarose electrophoresis at pH 8.6. Its molecular weight as estimated by sephadex chromatography is 168,100.A sensitive hemolytic assay based on the property of C1r to link C1s to C1q and thereby to generate macromolecular C[unk]1 is described. The number of C[unk]1 molecules generated is stoichiometrically related to the concentration of C1r for a fixed C1q and C1s concentration provided that the titration is carried out below the plateau zone. Macromolecular C1 can be separated from free C1s as the former is cell bound.This method of purification and assay should allow the development of monospecific antisera and further chemical study of C1r.Images	C1r, subunit of the first complement component: purification, properties, and assay based on its linking role	Maria M.

Rabbit anticryoprotein and anticomplement antisera recognized a heat-labile antigen in normal human serum. This antigen best fitted the previously described US protein because of its presence in fresh human serum, euglobulin, and purified 11S preparations and its absence in heated serum, R11S, and pseudoglobulin preparations. The 11S hemolytic activity correlated well with the presence of this heat-labile antigen in the 11S region in sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and in the gamma globulin region on zone electrophoresis. It could be identified as a single component in the gamma globulin region in immunoelectrophoresis. The intermediate complex EAC'11S was lysed by R11S reagents and agglutinated by these antisera. The antisera also agglutinated a human complement-binding Rh-positive cell system if the 11S protein had been previously bound.

The absorption of phenolsulfonphthalein (phenol red) was used as a measure in vivo of intestinal permeability in anesthetized rats. A chelating agent, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (NaEDTA), placed in the lumen evoked a fivefold increase in membrane permeability; at the same time the mucosal content of magnesium and calcium decreased significantly. Making either magnesium or calcium available to the luminal surface of the membrane in isotonic solution restored normal permeability and brought the cation contents above the original levels. Electron micrographs of tissues treated in vivo with NaEDTA revealed (a) rounded swellings on the microvilli in the area of the junctional complexes between adjacent epithelial cells, (b) widening of intercellular channels particularly in the region of the intermediate junctions (zonulae adhaerentes), and (c) loss of architectural detail in the region of the desmosomes (maculae adhaerentes) with separation of their dense borders. All of these alterations in fine structure could be reversed by in vivo cation replacements which reinstated normal permeability. The implications of these findings on mechanisms of fluid transport across epithelial membranes are discussed, and a working hypothesis for the role of divalent cations in membrane permeability regulation is presented.

"A correlation is made between the appearances of the nexus (""gap junction"") as revealed by thin-section and by freeze-cleave electron microscopy techniques. These methods reveal different aspects of a complex subunit assembly forming the nexus membranes. In thin sections, the nexus is formed by the very close apposition of two ""unit"" membranes. The electron-opaque tracer, colloidal lanthanum hydroxide, outlines an aspect of electron-lucent subunits that project into the central region of the nexus. The freeze-cleave technique demonstrates novel membrane faces that are generated from within the interior of plasma membranes by splitting them into two lamellae (Lm): Lm 1 adjacent to the cytoplasm, and Lm 2 adjacent to the extracellular space. Each of the two membranes forming the nexus can be split into these two lamellae. On the new face of Lm 1, particles approximately 50 A in diameter are closely packed in an array which is often hexagonal with a 90–100 A center-to-center spacing. The two apposed lamellae (Lm 2-Lm 2) of the nexus are constructed of sheets of subunits in a similar array. The Lm 1 particles appear to extend into the Lm 2 subunits to form macromolecular complexes. The Lm 2 subunits extend to the center of the nexus to form the contacts outlined by lanthanum in sections. It is postulated that central hydrophilic channels may extend through the subunit assembly to provide a direct route for intercellular communication."

Although circumstantial evidence has suggested that gap junctions mediate intercellular electrotonic coupling, it has not been possible in most tissues to exclude the involvement of other, coexisting cell junctions. We have made an electron microscopic study of replicas of frozen-fractured BHK21 cells (from tissue culture) and of brown fat cells of newborn mice. Both of these cell types are known to exhibit intercellular electrical coupling. In each case, the only junctions found between the cells are small macular gap junctions (less than 1 μm in diameter) characterized by clusters of 6-nm (60 Å) particles or depressions on membrane cleavage faces. Several replicas confirm the association of these particles and depressions with regions of narrowing of the intercellular space, i.e., with the sites of cell junctions. We have also determined the frequency of occurrence of gap junctions on the membrane cleavage faces of both cell types. Gap junctions occupy about 1-2% of the surface area of brown fat cells, but only 0.05% of the surface area of BHK21 cells. These observations indicate that gap junctions, when they are the only intercellular junctions present, are sufficient to account for electronic coupling between cells.Images	Gap Junctions between Electrotonically Coupled Cells in Tissue Culture and in Brown Fat	J.

Nexuses, that is, fusions of plasma membranes of adjacent cells, are described in mammalian smooth and cardiac muscle, median giant axon of earthworm, frog skin, and rat submandibular gland. In smooth muscle they usually occur where a process from one cell either meets a process of, or projects into a neighboring cell. On the other hand, in mammalian heart muscle and in earthworm giant axon the nexuses occur along the intercalated disc and intercellular segmental septa, respectively. Their occurrence between these excitable cells is correlated with propagation of action potentials by an electrical rather than chemical mechanism. Since the nexuses may offer pathways for electric current between cell interiors, it seems possible that they constitute a link in the structural basis for electrical transmission in these systems. In epithelia, nexuses usually appear as part of a terminal bar complex. This is true in the rat salivary gland studied here. In the epidermis of frog skin, nexuses are less numerous between the basilar columnar cells than between the subjacent squamous cells. The nexuses which occur in epithelia in frog skin and rat salivary gland are distributed as though to provide seals against electrochemical backleaks and sites of chemical exchange between cell interiors.

This report provides information on the morphology of fat absorption in rat intestinal epithelial cells. Three types of experiments were performed: (a) intubation of corn oil into fasted rats, (b) injection of physiological fatty-chyme prepared from fat-fed donor rats into ligated segments of jejunum of fasted animals, and (c) administration of electron-opaque particles in corn oil and markers given concurrently with the fat. These results support the hypothesis that fat is absorbed by selective diffusion of monoglycerides and fatty acids from micelles rather than by pinocytosis of unhydrolized triglycerides. Evidence is presented that the pits between the microvilli, previously believed to function in the transport of fat, are not involved in this process. Instead they appear to contribute their contents to lysosomes in the apical cytoplasm. Arguments are offered that the monoglycerides and fatty acids diffuse from the micelle while the latter is associated with the microvillous membrane of the absorptive cell. These micellar components penetrate the plasma membrane and diffuse into the cytoplasmic matrix where they encounter the SER. Triglyceride synthesis occurs in the SER and results in the deposition of fat droplets within its lumina. The synthesis of triglycerides and their sequestration into the SER establishes an inward diffusion gradient of monoglycerides and fatty acids.

Steatorrhoea in rats with an intestinal cul-de-sac is mainly due to malabsorption of alimentary fats but faecal lipids of endogenous origin are also increased. Steatorrhoea depends on the site of the blind loop in the small intestine and is mainly caused by bacterial proliferation in the lumen of the gut. The aetiological role of Gram-positive anaerobic microbes, especially Clostridium welchii, is suggested.ImagesFIG. 3FIG. 4FIG. 5FIG. 6	Steatorrhoea in rats with an intestinal cul-de-sac	P. P.

A lipid mixture (monoolein, oleic acid-1-14C, and palmitic acid-9,10-3H) was infused intraduodenally at a steady rate for 8 hr in fasted, unanesthetized rats. The same dose of lipid was given together with pure conjugated bile salts either as an emulsion, 2.5 mM bile salts, or as a micellar solution, 10 mM bile salts. The emulsion contained very little or no micellar lipid. Thoracic duct lymph was collected and in some experiments bile and pancreatic juice were drained to the exterior. After 4-5 hr infusion the same steady lymphatic output of radioactive fatty acids was obtained with emulsion as with micellar solution. It was concluded that absorption of fatty acid could proceed efficiently in the virtual absence of micellar solubilization. In rats with biliary plus pancreatic fistulae, labeled triglyceride was absorbed poorly relative to free fatty acids in the same emulsified particles. This suggested that fatty acids were transferred to the absorptive cells in monomolecular solution and not as emulsion particles.Substitution of a synthetic nonionic detergent for bile salts in lipid mixtures given to rats with biliary and pancreatic fistulae did not affect the lymphatic output of radioactive fatty acids. This indicated that mucosal esterification of labeled free fatty acids was normal in the absence of bile salts. The physical state of the lipid did not affect the pathway of absorption. Finally, comparison of the increased output of esterified fat in the lymph with the output of labeled fat suggested that fat absorption did not greatly affect the turnover of endogenous, unlabeled fat. Results were consistent with the view that most of the endogenous lymph fat comes from reabsorbed biliary lipid.	Absorption of oleic and palmitic acids from emulsions and micellar solutions	W. J.

1. A technique is described for the removal of subcellular contaminants from intact rat intestinal brush borders, and for the subsequent separation of a microvillus membrane fraction from a fibrillar residue. 2. Increments in invertase activity, microscopic homogeneity and low nucleic acid content indicate that the microvillus plasma membrane has been extensively purified. Multiple membrane preparations have been shown to be highly reproducible with respect to their invertase specific activity, cholesterol content and phospholipid content. Alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, Mg2+- and Ca2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and seven separate disaccharidases were shown to be predominantly confined to the membrane fraction. 3. The fibrillar fraction has been shown to contain approximately 30% of the total protein of purified brush borders, plus most of the residual nucleic acid contaminant. No evidence was found for the localization of any specific enzyme in this fraction.ImagesPLATE 1PLATE 2	Rat intestinal microvillus membranes. Purification and biochemical characterization	G. G.

A technique is described for the isolation of a plasma-membrane fraction from the rat intestinal epithelial cell which is distinct from the microvillus membrane of that cell. The isolated fraction contains only about 0.2% of the sucrase activity in the original homogenate and negligible quantities of nuclear and mitochondrial membrane markers. It contains 12% of the total Na+,K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and 7% of the alkaline phosphatase, with significant increments in specific activity of these enzymes. Multiple membrane preparations were highly reproducible with respect to the specific activities of the markers studied. The small intestine of one rat yields material containing about 1.3mg of protein. In addition an assay is described suitable for determining 5′-nucleotidase in the small intestine.ImagesPLATE 1PLATE 2PLATE 3PLATE 4	Preparation and characterization of the lateral and basal plasma membranes of the rat intestinal epithelial cell	A.

An `in-vitro' technique is described for measuring quantitatively the absorption and secretion of water and electrolytes, the short circuiting current, and the simultaneous bidirectional flux rates of ions across the healthy and diseased colonic mucosa. The results show that the normal colon absorbs both sodium and water and secretes potassium.In both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease there is a reversal of sodium and water flux and potassium secretion is increased.A measure of the simultaneous bidirectional flux rates under conditions of zero potential has allowed us to use the Ussing equation to analyse some of the factors involved in sodium transport across the healthy and diseased mucosa.

Using a triple-lumen constant perfusion system, we have studied ileal electrolyte transport in a patient with congenital alkalosis with diarrhea and made the following observations. First, chloride cannot be transported against electrochemical gradients, but can be readily absorbed or secreted down electrochemical gradients. Second, chloride secretion down an electrochemical gradient can be increased by raising lumen bicarbonate concentration. Third, sodium absorption does occur against electrochemical gradients and is associated with hydrogen ion secretion. Fourth, electrical potential difference (PD) between lumen and blood is near zero when lumen sodium concentration is 140 mEq/liter. Fifth, a normal sodium diffusion potential is present. Sixth, potassium is transported passively in response to electrochemical gradients.The ileal electrolyte transport disorder of congenital alkalosis with diarrhea can be simulated exactly in normal subjects perfused with a solution in which chloride is replaced with poorly absorbable sulfate and phosphate.These results can be explained by postulating a single defect in the double ion exchange model (sodium-hydrogen, chloride-bicarbonate) previously proposed for normal ileal transport: i.e., normal sodium-hydrogen exchange, but a chloride-bicarbonate exchange that is incapable of transporting chloride against an electrochemical gradient, yet continues to transport anions passively. In contrast, the results appear incompatible with the concept of ileal electrogenic sodium transport.

A dialysis method for the study of intestinal absorption is described. Its use has been assessed in animals and normal human subjects and it has been applied to the measurement of rectal transport of sodium and water.When the luminal solution was of high sodium concentration (145 m-equiv/1), the sodium influx rate (lumen to plasma) was about five times greater than the sodium efflux rate (plasma to lumen). The luminal sodium concentration associated with zero net sodium flux was very low (<15 m-equiv/1). As the mucosa was charged with the luminal side negative, the epithelium must therefore possess a powerful sodium absorbing `pump'. With isotonic solutions in the lumen, the amount of water absorbed depended on the sodium concentration and when this was 30 m-equiv/1 or less, no significant water absorption was detectable. When, however, water absorption was altered by imposing osmotic gradients, sodium absorption was not significantly affected. The luminal solution tended to become issomolar with plasma; osmotic gradients across the epithelium did not develop.The particular transport properties of rectal epithelium enabling it to remove sodium from the lumen against considerable electrochemical gradients are well adapted to its function.

An investigation of small intestinal electrolyte transport was performed in a subject with congenital chloridorrhoea using a constant perfusion technique. The results indicate that the diarrhoea was not due to an abnormally high rate of secretion of fluid into the duodenum, and transport of electrolytes and glucose was normal in the jejunum. In contrast there was a marked abnormality of electrolyte transport in the ileum, chloride, sodium, and water entering the lumen and bicarbonate being absorbed in the absence of any concentration gradients for these ions. This is clearly different from the finding in normal subjects of sodium chloride and water absorption and bicarbonate secretion.It is suggested that the likely prime mechanism for these abnormalities is a chloride/bicarbonate exchange acting in the direction of chloride secretion, that is, in the opposite direction to the normal anion exchange. The hydrogen ion gradient set up by this exchange could have induced a secondary reversal of the normal sodium/hydrogen exchange so that hydrogen was absorbed and sodium secreted.From an analysis of the stool electrolyte concentrations and the rectal electrical potential difference it is suggested that in the colon chloride was secreted and bicarbonate absorbed against electrochemical gradients. Here too a reversed chloride/bicarbonate exchange is possibly responsible for the composition of the faecal electrolytes. As evidenced by the low faecal sodium concentration and the normal rectal potential difference, sodium transport is probably normal in the colon.

A method is described which allows rapid measurement of the electrical potential difference across colonic mucosal epithelium to be carried out during routine sigmoidoscopy. The potential differences measured had a mean value of 25 mV (range 4 to 51 mV) in 27 subjects with normal bowel. Six hours after two intravenous injections of 0·5 mg aldosterone the potential difference had risen to 60 mV (range 37 to 101 mV). The time course of responses studied after a single injection of aldosterone showed that the potential allowance rose within four hours and had fallen again after 18 hours. Urinary sodium concentrations and sodium/potassium ratios fell after aldosterone injections, the time course of the changes being similar to that of the potential differences of the colon. Sodium concentration of stool fluid also fell. The concentration of chloride in the stool fluid was consistent with a passive distribution of chloride according to the electrochemical gradient, but that of potassium was considerably greater than expected from a passive distribution, suggesting that potassium is actively secreted into the lumen of the colon.

The transmucosal electrical potential difference (pd) and the sodium and potassium flux rates (using a dialysis method) have been measured in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon of patients with ulcerative colitis and compared with measurements made in individuals having normal bowel function. In active colitis, a very low transmucosal pd was found and was associated with loss of the characteristic ability of the mucosa to absorb sodium against considerable electrochemical gradients; a marked increase in the plasma-to-lumen sodium flux rate, suggesting increased leakiness of the mucosa; and loss of the active sodium absorption mechanism. In resolving colitis, the pd was higher and all these changes of sodium transport tended to return towards normal. With full recovery, epithelial function was normal to the present tests. Potassium secretion rate showed little difference at various stages of the disease, but the nearly normal secretion of potassium in ulcerative colitis when the pd was low suggested that potassium loss to the lumen was excessive. Mucus collected from patients with ulcerative colitis had a relatively high sodium and potassium content. Measurement of pd and absorption by using a dialysis tube offers a simple means of rapid assessment of mucosal functional integrity.

1. An investigation has been carried out into various factors which influence the transmucosal potential difference (p.d.) of rat colon in vivo when the p.d. is either high (> 30 mV) or low (< 20 mV).2. The p.d. was uninfluenced by short duration anaesthesia with ether or pentobarbitone. When anaesthesia was prolonged for several hours, p.d. rose steadily. The gradient of p.d. along the descending colon which developed and its elimination by adrenalectomy suggested that the rise was due to increased secretion of adrenal steroids.3. P.d. was increased by Na depletion after a delay of about 18 hr and fell again following Na repletion with a similar time delay. A characteristic gradient of p.d. along the descending colon was seen.4. Both haemorrhage and anoxia caused a rapid fall of p.d. P.d. was restored rapidly to its previous level when anoxia was corrected.5. Vasopressin (I.V.) in low dose was without effect; in high dose it caused a transient fall of p.d. associated with intense vasoconstriction of gut blood vessels.6. The following factors studied were without effect on p.d.: presence of glucose within the lumen; considerable osmotic gradients across the mucosa; variation of luminal pH over the range 5·2-9·8; intravenous administration of acetazolamide, chlorothiazide, frusemide, triamterene, ethacrynic acid or ouabain. Ouabain in the luminal solution also had no effect in all but two rats in which a small fall of p.d. was seen.7. 2,4-dinitrophenol, 10-2M, in the lumen caused a small fall of p.d. only if the p.d. was high.8. Experiments were done to determine the effect on p.d. of altering the ionic composition of the luminal solution. When the p.d. was low (< 20 mV) alteration of [Na], [K] or [Cl] produced small absolute changes of the p.d., all of comparable magnitude. The changes could be interpreted as due to diffusion potentials resulting from the ionic gradients across the mucosa. When the p.d. was high (> 30 mV), it showed a striking dependence on the luminal [Na] only, consistent with the presence of a large p.d. due to active Na transport.

1. The Na, K and water content of stools, and of gut contents removed from the terminal ileum, caecum and colon were determined in normal and Na-depleted rats and the p.d. across the colon wall measured at the site of removal of each specimen.2. During passage through the caecum and colon, especially the ascending segment of colon, the faecal Na and water content fell considerably, K content being unchanged in the normal rats and falling in the Na-depleted. Na concentration of the faecal water fell but K concentration rose owing to water absorption.3. Feeding normal rats with a sulphonated polystyrene resin caused a considerable Na loss in the stool, the ratio Na/(Na+K) being consistently greater than in rats not taking resin. Resin induced little Na but much K loss in Na-depleted rats.4. The electrical p.d. across the colon wall varied little over the length of the caecum and colon in normal rats, rarely exceeding 20 mV, the serosa being +ve with respect to lumen. Potential difference measurements were greater in Na-depleted rats, and those of the caecum and descending colon were consistently higher than those of the ascending colon. There was a similar pattern in resin-fed rats but potentials tended to be higher.5. K concentration of the gut contents was always greater than could be accounted for if K were passively distributed across the colonic mucosa.6. It was concluded that: (i) active Na absorption was stimulated by Na depletion; (ii) K was probably actively transported into the colon lumen, and when unabsorbable anions were present in the gut K secretion was critically important in Na absorption; (iii) the elevation of p.d. associated with Na depletion was probably associated with the stimulated Na transport.

1. Ascending and descending segments of colon of normal and Nadepleted rats were perfused with solutions of differing KCl concentration. Net K flux, electrical p.d. and, in some experiments, unidirectional K fluxes were measured.2. Variation of luminal K concentration over the range 0-40 mM did not affect p.d. or K efflux rate.3. K secretion rate fell about 30% when Na-free choline chloride solution was perfused.4. Net flux was a linear function of the luminal K concentration, and fell as the latter increased. Na depletion increased K secretion rate and passive permeability of the mucosa to K. Adrenalectomy had the reverse effect. The luminal K concentration, associated with zero net K flux was much greater than expected if the colonic mucosa behaved passively with respect to K.5. Unidirectional fluxes determined when 5 mM-KCl was in the lumen showed that the ratio influx/efflux was much less than predicted by Ussing's flux ratio equation.6. It was concluded that K influx was due to simple diffusion and K efflux to diffusion and active transport, both processes being increased by Na depletion.

1. In a preparation consisting of the myenteric plexus and the longitudinal muscle layer removed from a segment of guinea-pig ileum, spontaneous action potentials occurred which were unaffected by tetrodotoxin but suppressed by Mn2+ and were therefore myogenic.2. A single current pulse of 0·1 ms duration evoked a response consisting of an early action potential followed after a delay of about 200 ms by a complex of biphasic spikes. The first action potential was conducted for no more than 15 mm and the second complex for 30-70 mm.3. Since the first action potential was unaffected by hyoscine or Mn2+ but abolished by tetrodotoxin, it was due to excitation of nerve fibres. The later complex of spikes was suppressed by hyoscine and Mn2+ and therefore due to excitation of smooth muscle. It was also inhibited by adrenaline or morphine, compounds which depress acetylcholine release. The evoked smooth muscle response was followed by absence of spontaneous electrical activity for 2-4 seconds.4. The nerves travelling in a longitudinal direction had a mean maximum conduction velocity of 0·65 m/s, an absolute refractory period of 2·8 ms and a relative refractory period of about 20 ms.5. The conduction velocity of the smooth muscle response evoked by stimulation of the nerve with a single pulse was 0·16 m/second. After a single pulse the muscle was inexcitable for 0·7-1·3 s; the delay of transmission from nerve to muscle was 210 ms. When instead of a single pulse a train of two-five pulses at 20 ms intervals was applied, the size, conduction distance and conduction velocity of the evoked smooth muscle response were increased.

The membrane properties of single cells of intestinal smooth muscle of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum of guinea-pig have been studied.1. The membrane potentials of longitudinal muscles of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum varied from 54 to 56 mV and those of circular muscles of jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum varied from 57 to 60 mV. The ablated longitudinal muscle had a slightly lower value (50 mV) than the intact one.2. The longitudinal muscle generated spontaneous discharges but these were rare in the circular muscles of the intestine except for the caecum. Overshoot potentials could be observed in all regions of the intestine. The maximum rate of rise of the spontaneously discharging longitudinal muscles varied from 11 to 18 V/sec.3. Not all of the slow potential changes (but at least some) were generated by the nervous elements distributed between the muscle layers and in them.4. The conduction velocities measured from the longitudinal muscles of jejunum and rectum in the presence of tetrodotoxin were 2·1 cm/sec and 4·0 cm/sec respectively.5. Chronaxies of the longitudinal muscles of jejunum and rectum were 2-5 msec and 5-18 msec respectively.6. Intracellular stimulation of the single cells of the duodenum and caecum could trigger a spike, similar to that observed in the taenia coli. The spikes were mostly graded ones; a spike of full size was rarely elicited. When the spikes were triggered, the after-hyperpolarization appeared consistently presumably caused by the increased potassium conductance.7. The effective membrane resistance and the time constant were measured for the longitudinal muscles of the jejunum and rectum. When spikes were generated by intracellular stimulation the observed values were 40-50 MΩ and 3-5 msec in both tissues. These values were the same as those observed in the taenia coli.8. When the time constant of the membrane was measured by the extracellular polarizing method, the longitudinal muscles of the jejunum especially and the rectum had smaller time constants than the taenia coli.9. The differences of conduction velocity and chronaxie of the different regions of the intestine are discussed in relation to the cable properties of the tissues which are directly influenced by the morphological arrangements of the tissues.

An examination of the mucosal epithelium of the urinary bladder of the toad reveals that the two major cell types which abut on the urinary surface, the granular and mitochondria-rich cells, also contact the basement membrane. Thus, the epithelium functions as a single cell layer. Although basal cells are interpolated between the granular cells and the basement membrane over a large portion of the epithelium, they do not constitute an additional continuous cell layer. This finding is consistent with extensive physiological data which had assumed that the major permeability barriers of this epithelium were the apical and basal-lateral plasma membranes of a single layer of cells.

The urinary bladder of the toad (Bufo marinus) was studied with both the light and the electron microscope. The bladder wall consists of epithelium, submucosa, and serosa. In the epithelium, four different cell types were recognized on the basis of their fine structure and staining properties with several different dyes. These four were designated as granular cells, mitochondria-rich cells, mucous cells, and basal cells. In addition, migratory cells of a different type were found in the basal region of the epithelium. The luminal surface of the epithelial cells presents irregular microvilli and is coated by PAS-positive material which has been further investigated by histochemical procedures and radioautography. Included is a description of the fine structural details of cell membranes, cell junctions, and intracellular components. The submucosa consists of a delicate stroma of fibroblasts and collagen fibers and also contains blood and lymph vessels, unmyelinated nerves, migratory cells, and smooth muscle cells. The serosa consists of a single layer of serosal (mesothelial) cells which form an uninterrupted covering of the viscus. Possible pathways of sodium and water transport across the bladder wall are discussed.	THE FINE STRUCTURE OF THE URINARY BLADDER OF THE TOAD, BUFO MARINUS	Jae Kwon Choi	14020969	1963-01-01	15	
Vasopressin increases the net transport of sodium across the isolated urinary bladder of the toad by increasing the mobility of sodium ion within the tissue. This change is reflected in a decreased DC resistance of the bladder; identification of the permeability barrier which is affected localizes the site of action of vasopressin on sodium transport. Cells of the epithelial layer were impaled from the mucosal side with glass micropipettes while current pulses were passed through the bladder. The resulting voltage deflections across the bladder and between the micropipette and mucosal reference solution were proportional to the resistance across the entire bladder and across the mucosal or apical permeability barrier, respectively. The position of the exploring micropipette was not changed and vasopressin was added to the serosal medium. In 10 successful impalements, the apical permeability barrier contributed 54% of the initial total transbladder resistance, but 98% of the total resistance change following vasopressin occurred at this site. This finding provides direct evidence that vasopressin acts to increase ionic mobility selectively across the apical permeability barrier of the transporting cells of the toad bladder.

1. Membrane potential changes of the smooth muscle cells of the taenia coli were recorded during stimulation of the perivascular inhibitory nerves.2. Some spontaneous action potentials were preceded by a slow pacemaker-like potential. Others began at or near the maximum level of the membrane potential and were not preceded by pacemaker-like potentials.3. There were no changes in the membrane potential of smooth muscle cells when the inhibitory nerves were stimulated with a single pulse. Stimulation at frequencies greater than 5 pulses/sec caused a hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle membrane. This resulted in a decrease in spike frequency and relaxation.4. When the frequency of stimulation of the inhibitory nerves was increased there was an increase in the amplitude and rate of rise of the hyperpolarization and a decrease of the latency. The latency varied from 150 to 300 msec, and the largest hyperpolarization recorded was 16 mV.5. The effect of the hyperpolarization due to nerve stimulation in cells showing pacemaker-like activity was to increase the level of the membrane potential at which the action potentials began and to increase the membrane potential to which the action potentials repolarized. Action potentials which occurred during hyperpolarizations of the membrane had greater rates of rise and fall and larger amplitudes than did the action potentials which occurred before hyperpolarization.6. The effect of the hyperpolarization due to nerve stimulation in cells which did not show pacemaker-like activity depended on the amplitude of the hyperpolarization. Small hyperpolarizations exposed small depolarizations of the membrane which occurred when an action potential would normally have been expected. Large hyperpolarizations blocked the action potentials entirely.7. Action potentials did not begin firing again at the normal rate immediately after stimulation ceased. The time taken for the rate of firing of action potentials to return to normal increased with increasing frequency of stimulation.8. The hyperpolarization in response to perivascular inhibitory nerve stimulation was blocked by guanethidine and bretylium.

1. Membrane potential changes of smooth muscle cells were recorded during stimulation of the intramural inhibitory nerves to the taenia coli.2. Stimulation across the taenia coli with single pulses of 200 μsec duration excites the intramural nerves and not the muscle directly.3. The membrane potential changes due to stimulation of the intramural inhibitory nerves were different from those produced by perivascular inhibitory nerve stimulation in the following ways: hyperpolarizations (i.j.p.'s) of up to 25 mV were produced in response to single pulses; the latency, i.e. the time taken for the membrane to hyperpolarize after a stimulus of maximal strength, was as short as 80 msec; when the nerves were stimulated repetitively the membrane was hyperpolarized by up to 35 mV and all spontaneous activity was abolished; the mean hyperpolarization due to repetitive stimulation increased with the frequency of stimulation up to 10 pulses/sec and then remained constant; the hyperpolarization due to stimulation at frequencies greater than 5 pulses/sec was not maintained but decreased after 3-5 sec of stimulation; and finally when stimulation had ceased action potentials commenced firing at frequencies greater than normal.4. The amplitude and rate of hyperpolarization of the i.j.p. increased with increasing strength of stimulation until a maximum amplitude and rate of hyperpolarization was reached. The recovery or depolarizing phase of the i.j.p. was exponential with a time constant which varied from about 250 msec to 500 msec and could not therefore be due to the discharge of the membrane capacitance. In some cases there was an inflexion on this depolarizing phase and in these cases recovery led directly into an action potential.5. Spontaneous hyperpolarizations of the membrane were seen in some cells, and these hyperpolarizations were similar to those recorded on submaximal stimulation of the intramural nerves.6. There were no changes in the characteristics of the i.j.p. in the presence of guanethidine or bretylium.

Twenty individual diarrhoeal stools from three patients with ileal resection were centrifuged at 14 000 g for one hour at 10°C to separate the stool into pellet and supernatant. Bile acids and electrolytes were measured in each phase.Relationships were examined between chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid in each phase and in toto to electrolyte and water loss.Chenodeoxycholic acid was associated with electrolyte and water loss whether present in solid or liquid phase. The association varied between individuals. The cholic acid content of the stool showed no association with electrolyte and water loss. It would appear that it is the total amount of chenodeoxycholic acid entering the colon, irrespective of its physical state, that is important in the diarrhoea of ileal dysfunction.

The ability of Salmonella typhimurium to invade the intestinal epithelium is essential to the pathogenesis of salmonella-induced intestinal secretion. This invasion is accompanied by an intense acute inflammatory reaction. The present study tests the hypothesis that the acute inflammatory reaction may have a role in the pathogenesis of salmonella-induced secretion. Two groups of rabbits infected with S. typhimurium were studied: normal animals and animals pretreated with nitrogen mustard. Nitrogen mustard depletes the polymorphonuclear leukocyte pool and thereby prevents the formation of an acute inflammatory reaction. In vivo ligated ileal loops were constructed and infected 72 h after nitrogen mustard administration when polymorphonuclear leukocytes were undetectable. Nitrogen mustard treatment markedly inhibited salmonella-induced  secretion. Ileal histology in normal animals infected with S. typhimurium revealed an intense acute inflammatory reaction, while in animals pretreated with nitrogen mustard only a rare polymorphonuclear leukocyte was seen. The antisecretory effect of nitrogen mustard was not merely a nonspecific effect since nitrogen mustard treatment did not inhibit cholera toxin-induced secretion and did not alter either ileal morphology nor the activities of various intestinal enzymes in normal animals. Nitrogen mustard also did not alter the virulence of the inoculated S. typhimurium. These data suggest that the mucosal inflammatory reaction induced by salmonella invasion may be important to the pathogenesis of the salmonella secretory process. The mechanism by which the inflammatory reaction stimulates secretion is not known.ImagesFig. 4Fig. 6	Importance of the intestinal inflammatory reaction in salmonella-mediated intestinal secretion.

Serum opsonic activity for E. coli 075, conversion of C3 by inulin, total hemolytic complement (CH50), levels of native C3, factor B, C3b inactivator (KAF), properdin (P), and immunoglobulins (Ig) were determined in 14 patients with burns involving 13% to 91% body surface during 6 to 8 weeks postburn. In the 12 uninfected patients, levels of IgG and IgA were reduced during the first 10 days postburn, and decreased concentrations of P and IgM were demonstrated from three to 6 weeks postburn. C3 conversion was reduced from 10 days to 6 weeks postburn. Levels of C3, factor B, and KAF were normal or elevated for the entire study period. No difference in the occurrence of humoral abnormalities was noted in patients with burns caused by flame, immersion scald, or acid contact. Reduction in C3 conversion and P concentration were the only abnormalities which correlated with increasing burn size. Bacteremia and/or fungemia was documented in the other two patients. In one of these patients, reduction in CH50 occurred during septicemia due to S. aureus, and in the other, reduction in all measurements of complement was associated with candidemia and Pseudomonas septicemia and occurred prior to the development of shock. Serum opsonic activity was only reduced significantly during sepsis, suggesting that this abnormality occurred as a result rather than a cause of infection. These results indicate that consumption of components of the classical and/or alternative pathways of complement activation may be an important mechanism by which infection is perpetuated in the burn patient. They also emphasize the importance of the clinical management of the burn patient in preventing the development of septic complications.

Circulating immune complexes were determined in 59 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and 100 blood donors by a double method based on the inhibition of the agglutinating activity of CIq and/or rheumatoid factor on the IgG-coated polystyrene particles. In patients, the incidence of positive immune complexes was 63% and 61% at first testing, 85% and 78% at subsequent determinations; there was a good correlation between the inhibition titres of CIq and those of rheumatoid factor (p less than 0.001). In blood donors, the incidence was 22% and 14% at low titre. The incidence of immune complexes was the lowest (36%) in the group of resected patients without signs of relapse; repeat determinations showed absence of immune complexes three months postoperatively. In patients medically treated for primary disease or relapse, rheumatoid factor titre higher than 1/1 was less frequent than in medically untreated patients with active disease (p less than 0.01). A significantly higher concentration of serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and orosomucoid, and a significantly lower level of serum iron were found in patients with an IC titre exceeding 1/1; longitudinal studies showed in most cases a concordance between the evolution of immune complex titres, inflammatory parameters and clinical status.

Short chain fatty acid absorption from the human rectum has been studied in 46 subjects attending an obesity clinic, using a dialysis bag technique. From a mixed electrolyte solution, acetate concentrations fell from 97.0 to 64.2 mmol/l, and sodium from 97.8 to 85.1 mmol/l with respective net absorption rates of 8.1 and 5.2 mumol/cm2/h. From a solution with mixed short chain fatty acids acetate concentration fell from 62.3 to 37.6 mmol/l, propionate from 20.2 to 11.5 mmol/l, and butyrate from 25.7 to 17.3 mmol/l with absorption rates of 5.2, 1.8, and 1.9 mumol/cm2/h. Lowering pH from 7.2 to 5.5, to test the possibility that absorption occurred by passive non-ionic diffusion, had no effect on absorption rates, although pH rose rapidly in the dialysis fluid. These results are comparable with rates of acetate absorption from the animal large intestine. The hypothesis that short chain fatty acids are not absorbed from the large gut and therefore contribute to faecal bulk by retaining water in the bowel lumen may need revision.

Antibodies were eluted from the isolated glomeruli prepared from the kidneys of 10 patients with the nephritis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Antibodies reacting primarily with buffer extracts of nuclei were eluted by acid treatment, and antibodies reacting mainly with DNA and nucleoprotein were eluted with deoxyribonuclease. Quantitative immunochemical studies revealed a high concentration of antinuclear antibody per milligram of γ-globulin in glomerular eluates compared with that in the corresponding serums. The γ-globulin of two eluates was found to consist predominantly of antinucleoprotein antibody. The selective elution of antinuclear antibodies was also indicated by the absence of other serum antibodies in the eluates. DNA antigen was demonstrated in the glomeruli of two kidneys with nephritis by means of isolated anti-DNA antibody labeled with fluorescein. In one of these cases, anti-DNA antibodies were also found concentrated in the glomeruli and, in the second, circulating anti-DNA antibodies were demonstrated in the patient's serum. The immunochemical evidence for the high specific activity of antinuclear antibodies and the association of DNA antigen with DNA antibody in glomeruli add further support for the antigen-antibody complex hypothesis for renal injury in systemic lupus erythematosus.

Mumps virus produced a carrier state in human conjunctiva cells that was maintained for more than 100 subcultures over a period of 3 years. Antiserum in the medium was not required. The virus had little apparent effect on the cells which grew at a rate similar to uninfected control cells. Mumps virus was regularly found in the culture medium at levels about 0.9 log higher than the cell-associated virus. When first tested after 30 subcultures, the virus was found to have lost its cytopathogenicity for cells ordinarily susceptible to mumps virus, but was identifiable as mumps virus by neutralization with specific antiserum. Use of fluorescein-labeled antiserum revealed that 80 to 95 per cent of cells in the carrier cultures contained mumps virus antigen. The antigen was concentrated in a few sharply circumscribed, discrete masses in the cell cytoplasm rather than in many granules throughout the cytoplasm as is characteristic of cell infection by cytopathogenic mumps virus. The carrier cultures were resistant to the destructive effect of a cytopathogenic line of mumps virus, but showed little resistance to the cytopathogenic effect of vesicular stomatitis, Sendai, or Newcastle disease viruses.

Mumps virus in a carrier culture of human conJunctiva cells (C-M cultures) persisted through 5½ months of cultivation in a medium containing sufficient specific antiserum to keep the fluid free of infectious virus. Cells from the C-M cultures were cloned under antiserum with an efficiency equal to control, uninfected cultures (40 to 100 per cent). Of 269 C-M cell clones examined, the cells of 262 contained antigen. Eight infected clones were grown into cultures sufficiently large to demonstrate that they released infectious virus and adsorbed erythrocytes in a manner similar to the original C-M cultures. Two uninfected clones were as susceptible to the effects of a cytopathogenic line of mumps virus as were uninfected control cells. In healthy, growing cultures of C-M cells 0.1 to 1.0 per cent of cells adsorbed erythrocytes to their surfaces, suggesting that these cells were releasing virus. Reduction of serum content of the medium to less than 3 per cent, depletion of the medium, or crowding of cultures resulted in hemadsorption by 50 to 90 per cent of cells and an increase of virus in the medium. In growing cultures hemadsorbing cells did not appear damaged. It was observed that cells could simultaneously exhibit hemadsorption and mitosis.

We observed that the volume of any anti-HSA serum needed to bind 50 per cent of the antigen is a linear function of the amount of antigen present in the reaction mixture over three log units. The slope is characteristic of each antiserum and reflects the `avidity' of the antibodies.By using this quantitative index we found that the avidity of antibodies produced during the secondary adoptive response depends on the number of the cells transferred: few cells will produce antibodies of lower avidity than many cells. The dose of antigen given as a booster also influences the quality of the antibody produced; in the extreme case where some primed cells were rendered `tolerant' by supra-optimal doses of challenging antigen, substantial amounts of low avidity antibodies were synthesized. The results can be explained by competition for antigen among competent cells, favouring those cells which carry antibody sites with high affinity for the corresponding antigenic determinant.

Female (NZB × NZW) F1 hybrid (B/W) mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei at the age of 1 month. In contrast to the high mortality from renal disease observed in control female mice of this strain, all of the malaria-infected female mice were alive at 12 months of age and none had any clinical features of severe renal disease. This finding gives some support to the hypothesis that a background of repeated parasitic infection may modify the development of autoimmune disease in man.ImagesFig. 4	Suppression of autoimmune disease in New Zealand mice associated with infection with malaria.

The onset of a positive Coombs test was significantly delayed in NZB mice infected with Plasmodium berghei at the age of 1 month. At the age of 12 months, twelve out of fourteen malaria-infected NZB mice had become Coombs positive but their reticulocyte counts and mean spleen weight were significantly lower than those of control NZB mice of the same age.Malaria infection of young NZB mice was associated with a significant increase in mean 24-hr urine protein excretion which fell gradually over the next 6 months. A secondary rise in urine protein excretion then occurred and at 12 months several malaria-infected NZB mice had severe renal disease.No increased incidence of malignant disease was observed in NZB mice infected with malaria.

BALB/c and (BALB/c×C57 BL) F1 hybrid mice infected with Plasmodium berghei yoelii developed a marked parasitaemia which lasted for 2–3 weeks. Immunization with sheep erythrocytes during the period of parasitaemia resulted in greatly reduced antibody formation and in a marked reduction in the number of plaque-forming cells in the spleens of infected mice. The maximal degree of immunosuppression coincided with the peak of parasitaemia. Antibody response to human γ-globulin but not to keyhole limpet haemocyanin was also markedly reduced. Skin graft rejection and contact hypersensitivity were not impaired during the infection and spleen cells from malaria infected mice responded normally to phytohaemagglutinin. Spleens from malaria infected mice reconstituted the ability of lethally irradiated mice to respond to sheep erythrocytes about one-half as effectively as spleens from normal mice. These findings are compatible with the view that the suppression of the immune response to sheep erythrocytes occurring in mice infected with P. berghei is related to a disturbance of macrophage function produced by the infection.

The mechanism of the immune suppression of mice infected with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei yoelii has been investigated.The clearance from the peripheral blood of carbon and 51Cr-labelled sheep erythrocytes was enhanced during the period of maximal parasitaemia and maximal immunosuppression, but the uptake of sheep erythrocytes by the spleens of infected mice did not differ significantly from the uptake by the spleens of healthy mice.There was no uptake of aggregated human γ-globulin into germinal centre areas of the spleens of infected mice during the period of maximal immune suppression, but the ability to localize human γ-globulin returned at a time when the mice recovered immune competence.It seems probable that acute malaria infections of mice induce a quantitative or qualitative defect in the cells responsible for transporting immune complexes into germinal centres. This defect may play a part in the immunosuppression induced by the malaria parasite.ImagesFig. 2	Immunosuppression in murine malaria. II.

The requirement for macrophages in thymus-dependent antibody responses was studied in vitro. Three different macrophage-deficient cell populations were studied: spleen cells passed through a glass bead column at 37°C, spleen cells cultured with specific antimacrophage serum, and thoracic duct lymphocytes. These cell populations from mice primed to dinitrophenylated (DNP) fowl gamma globulin were unable to respond to the homologous conjugate in vitro. DNP-reactive B cells were present in normal proportions, since all three macrophage-depleted populations responded normally to macrophage-independent and thymus-independent DNP flagella. Carrier-reactive T cells were present, as the helper capacity of carrier-primed spleen cells was the same as carrier-primed lymphocytes, and thoracic duct lymphocytes are a well-established source of helper cells. The inhibition of the cooperative response was thus due to removal of macrophages, and this was proven by restoration of thymus-dependent anti-DNP responses by small numbers of anti-θ-treated peritoneal exudate cells. These results suggest that macrophages are essential in cell collaboration, While their exact function in cell collaboration is not yet known, the above observation suggests that the mechanism of T-B collaboration involves the surface of macrophages.

In serum sickness, mechanisms by which circulating immune complexes become localized in the walls of vessels and glomeruli have been studied. In affected arteries, morphologic observations showed that circulating marker particles of carbon would rapidly deposit along the luminal surface of the internal elastic lamina. This, as in previous studies, suggested an increase in vascular permeability during which large molecules were capable of being trapped by a filtering membrane in the vessel wall. In attempts to prevent the increase in vascular permeability, rabbits were treated with antagonists of histamine and serotonin. Such treatment markedly inhibited the localization of immune complexes in glomeruli, the development of proteinuria, and glomerular endothelial proliferation. Cardiovascular lesions also were largely prevented from developing. Depletion of platelets, the principal reservoir of vasoactive amines, had a similar though less pronounced effect. While the deposition of immune complexes was inhibited, allergic inflammation in general was not, since normal rabbits treated as above were found capable of developing full Arthus reactions and acute nephrotoxic nephritis. Hydrodynamic factors were noted to be important in determining the location of arterial lesions. Studies of aortas from unmodified rabbits and from those with surgically induced coarctations of the abdominal aorta revealed intimal lesions concentrated at areas of high turbulence, such as at branches, bifurcations, outflows and zones of configurational change. Lesions in these areas were also largely inhibitable by depletion of platelets or by antagonists of histamine and serotonin.

1. Kidney biopsies from 4 cases of severe acute glomerulonephritis were obtained 11 to 25 days after the onset of clinical manifestations of the disease. These tissues were treated with ferritin-conjugated antibodies to 7S γ-globulin, β1C, and Type 12 streptococcal products. Adjacent pieces of the biopsied material were treated with control ferritin-labeled antisera or with ferritin alone. As further controls, normal renal tissue and renal tissue from patients with other kidney diseases were treated with the same antisera. The 3 antisera to 7S γ-globulin, β1C and Type 12 streptococcus were specifically bound in electron-opaque foreign material in the following renal areas: (a) the lumen of glomerular capillaries; (b) medullary arteriolar walls (2 cases); (c) pinocytic vacuoles and absorption droplets of endothelial or mesangial cells; (d) canals between proliferating mesangial or endothelial cells which connect the capillary lumen with the deep mesangial region or with the endothelial side of the basement membrane; (e) basement membrane proper; (f) subendothelial and certain subepithelial deposits; and (g) Bowman's space. 2. None of the 3 ferritin-conjugated antisera listed above were bound to the nuclei of glomerular cells or to portions of the cytoplasm other than those specified. 3. Ferritin-conjugated antisera to pneumococcus Type II and vaccinia virus and ferritin alone were not bound to any structures in the glomerular tissue. 4. None of the ferritin-conjugated antisera bound to normal renal tissue or to kidney tissue from other renal disease. 5. The data obtained are compatible with the following working hypothesis: Antigen-antibody aggregates of Type 12 streptococcal products, γ-globulin, and complement are present in the circulating blood of patients with severe acute glomerulonephritis. Large amounts of the complexes are caught in the filtering system of the glomeruli. The inflammatory reactions seen in the glomerular structures result from the presence of the immune complexes and of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes which conjointly may be responsible for the disease.

Hapten-antibody complexes prepared at equivalence with the bivalent hapten bis-DNP-octamethylene-diamine and purified rabbit anti-DNP antibody were fractionated by Sepharose gel-filtration and the fractions examined by electron microscopy. Individual fractions were tested for whole-complement fixation and C1 fixation. Dimer forms did not show this type of biological activity, while fractions containing tetramers and larger polymers exhibited both C and C1 fixation, which could be inhibited by prior exposure of the complexes to the univalent hapten epsilon-DNP-caproic acid. The dose-response result indicated that the C-fixation observed was not due to interpolymeric cooperative effects. It was concluded that in the generation of biological activity by soluble antigen-antibody complexes made with complement-fixing antibody, quaternary structural changes following specific combination with antigen may be as important as any tertiary structural alterations that occur in the individual immunoglobulin molecule.

Conditions were developed by which the separated H and L chains of gamma2 globulins recombined to form four-chained molecules in good yields. In the absence of antigen, anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) H chains randomly reassociated with a mixture of antibody and non-specific gamma2 globulin L chains. In the presence of a specific hapten, however, the antibody H chains preferentially interacted with the anti-DNP L chains. Antibody H chain-antibody L chain recombinants formed in the presence of hapten were more active than the corresponding recombinants formed in the absence of hapten. Speculations are made regarding the possible mechanisms and biological significance of these effects.

Chronic infections induced at birth with either LCM, an RNA virus, or polyoma, a DNA virus, in NZB, NZW, and NZB x W mice enhance ANA formation, aggravate the immune complex glomerulonephritis, and increase the associated mortality. The ANA titer was increased without apparent change in specificity of the antibodies involved in all three types of mice. Glomerulonephritis, while more severe in infected mice, was of the same type as occurred spontaneously and was characterized by a granular to lumpy accumulation of host IgG and C3 in the mesangia and along the capillary walls of the glomeruli. Of the LCM infected mice of all three types over 50% had died of glomerulonephritis by 6 months and over 85% by 9 months. Of the polyoma infected mice of all three types approximately 20% had died of glomerulonephritis by 6 months and over 40% by 9 months. Of the uninfected controls of all three types less than 10% had died by 6 months and less than 20% at 9 months except for the NZB x W females which had a 67% mortality at 9 months as a result of their spontaneous glomerulonephritis. The two viral infections had significant effect on the incidence of anti-red cell antibodies or the severity of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in any of the three NZ mice.

Further evidence implicating murine leukemia-like virus in the disorders of NZB mice was afforded by a study of antigens associated with murine leukemia virus (MuLV). MuLV group antigens were prevalent in extracts of spleen, kidney, and, to a lesser extent, thymus throughout a substantial portion of the life span of NZB mice as well as in extracts of lymphomas and sarcomas indigenous to the strain. G (Gross) soluble antigen, type-specific antigen, was first detected in plasma of untreated NZB mice at 3 months of age. G soluble antigen production increased thereafter in line with age, with 50% of reactions becoming positive at 5.3 months and 100% at 7 to 9 months. From months 3 to 9, the time-response curve for positive conversion of direct antiglobulin (Coombs) tests in untreated NZB mice corresponded closely to that for G soluble antigen production. Beyond the 9th month, G soluble antigen underwent elimination from the plasma of NZB mice, with positive reactions reduced to 50% at 13.3 months and to 0% at 18 months. G natural antibody was first detected in the serum of NZB mice at about 10 months of age and increased thereafter in line with age. The curves for G antibody production and G soluble antigen elimination bore a reciprocal relation to each other with crossover at 50% response occurring at 13.3 months. Significant proteinuria, a functional manifestation of membranous glomerulonephritis, became increasingly prevalent in female NZB mice as G soluble antigen was eliminated from plasma. Cumulative mortality of female NZB mice, mainly attributable to renal glomerular disease, increased in phase with G antibody production. MuLV group antigens were identified in the glomerular lesions by the immunofluorescence method. Positive conversion of direct antiglobulin tests was significantly delayed by vaccinating baby NZB mice with formaldehyde-inactivated cell-free filtrates of older NZB mouse spleens. The plasmas of vaccinated NZB mice with negative direct antiglobulin reactions at 4 to 7 months were likewise negative when tested for G soluble antigen. The 50% response time for G antibody production in the vaccinated NZB mice occurred at 7.3 months, that is, 6 months earlier than in untreated NZB mice. The collective findings implicate murine leukemia-like virus in the etiology of autoimmune hemolytic disease and membranous glomerulonephritis, as well as malignant lymphoma, of NZB mice and suggest that virus-specified cell-surface and soluble antigen is a factor in the immunopathogenesis of the renal disease and possibly also the autoimmune hemolytic disease.

The immune responsiveness of (NZB x NZW) F1 hybrid mice (NZB/W) has been compared with that of three other strains of mice, A/J, BALB/c, and CBA/J. The antigens used included sheep red blood cells (SRBC), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and human γ-globulin (HGG). It was found that important strain differences existed in the amount of antibody produced, but the relative immune responsiveness depended very much upon the nature of antigen. By comparison with the other strains tested, NZB/W mice had a higher antibody production to some antigens (SRBC and BSA) but were low responders to others (KLH). Induction of unresponsiveness to HGG by treatment with ultracentrifuged HGG was studied in the strains cited above. NZB/W mice became tolerant after injection of HGG ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 2 hr. Similar experiments carried out with another preparation of HGG (centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min) failed to reveal any abnormal behavior of NZB/W mice as compared to BALB/c or A/J mice. These results do not support the concept that NZB/W mice possess a general immune hyperreactivity or a relative inability to be made tolerant to protein antigens. However, they do not rule out the possibility that these mice have a genetically determined hyperresponsiveness to some antigens, in particular to nuclear antigens.

A method is described whereby biologically active H and L chains, free from each other by immunochemical criteria, can be prepared from guinea-pig γ2-immunoglobulin. The procedure makes use of mild reduction and alkylation in the absence of a denaturing agent, followed by gel filtration in the presence of 4 M guanidine·HCl.Specific binding of antigen by the method of equilibrium dialysis was found only when specific H chains were mixed with L chains, with more activity resulting when the L chains were also specific. Specific binding by antibody H chains alone was not found.ImagesFIG. 2FIG. 3	Isolation of purified H and L polypeptide chains from guinea-pig γ2-immunoglobulin after mild reduction	M. E. Lamm, V.

Guinea pig 7S immunoglobulins (γ1 and γ2) consist of two groups of molecules (K and L) bearing different types of L chains (κ and λ). Approximately one-third of the molecules in normal guinea pig γ2-globulin bear the λ- type of L chains, and all or most of the others bear κ-chains. κ- and λ-chains have similar molecular weights.

In guinea pig purified antihapten antibodies, the proportion of molecules bearing the κ- or λ-type of L chains (K or L molecules) may diverge markedly from that found in normal γ2-globulins. This has been evaluated by precipitation of I131-labeled antibody preparations using a specific anti-λ-chain antiserum. Anti-DNP antibodies isolated 3 wk after immunization of guinea pigs with DNP65-BGG antibodies, contain less than 1% of L molecules, while in pipsyl antibodies, isolated from the sera of animals immunized with pipsyl-BGG, the proportion of L molecules is significantly greater than in normal γ2-globulins. Anti-DNP antibodies produced against conjugates of this hapten with carriers other than BGG (BSA, OVA, or poly-L-lysine) or with BGG with a small number of DNP groups (DNP10-BGG) contained a greater proportion of λ-chain bearing molecules than anti-DNP antibodies isolated from late sera of guinea pigs immunized with highly conjugated DNP65-BGG. An increased percentage of L molecules was detected in preparations of anti-DNP65-BGG antibodies isolated early (10 days), when compared to those isolated later during the course of immunization. However, the level of L molecules in all these anti-DNP antibody preparations was always considerably below that present in normal γ2-globulin. The relative amounts of L molecules in distinct immunoglobulin families (γ1 and γ2) in antibody preparations isolated from individual animals was remarkably similar.

A combination of double immunofluorescent technique and radioautographic localization of radioactive antigens was used to investigate the question whether single antibody-producing cells can make antibodies of more than one specificity after immunization with antigens bearing more than one determinant. When guinea pig γ2-globulins, containing the F(ab')2 and Fc determinants, were used to immunize rabbits, a small percentage of cells (3.7%) were stained with both the anti-F(ab')2 and anti-Fc reagents. These results were shown to be due to the lack of absolute specificity of the detecting antigen and antibody reagents which can be obtained for use in this system. However, when immunological systems such as hapten-protein conjugates were used, and where completely specific antigen and antibody reagents could be prepared, the results were unequivocal. The individual lymph node cells from rabbits or guinea pigs immunized with hapten-protein conjugates produced antibodies against the hapten or antibodies against the antigenic determinants of the carrier molecule, never antibodies against both specificities.

Young adult (BALB/c × A/J)F1 hybrid mice have no detectable leukemia viruses. When inoculated with parental BALB/c spleen lymphoid cells, also free of detectable virus, leukemia viruses rapidly become activated in the injected host. Because of similarities between such graft-induced allogeneic disease and spontaneous autoimmunity, it is proposed that autoimmune reactions may activate latent viruses.Images	Leukemia Virus Activation in Chronic Allogeneic Disease	M. S. Hirsch, P. H. Black, G. S. Tracy, S. Leibowitz, R. S. Schwartz	4395204	1970-12-01	15	
The pathogenesis of the spontaneous glomerulonephritis of NZB and (NZB x NZW) F1 hybrid mice is related at least in part to the formation of natural antibody against antigens of the G (Gross) system, and apparently to the deposition in the glomeruli of immune complexes of G natural antibody with G soluble antigen (GSA), type-specific antigen specified by wild-type Gross leukemia virus. G natural antibody and GSA are detectable in the acid-buffer eluate of the kidneys of NZB mice during the course of the glomerulonephritis. (NZB x NZW) F1 hybrid mice develop glomerulonephritis and produce GSA and free G natural antibody earlier in life than do NZB mice. The proteinuria manifestation of the gomerulonephritis of (NZB x NZW) F1 hybrid mice becomes increasingly prevalent as GSA undergoes immune elimination from the circulation. Gross leukemia virus-specified antigens together with bound immunoglobulins are located in the glomerular lesions of (NZB x NZW) F1 hybrid mice, both in the mesangium as observed in NZB mice and also in the wall of the peripheral capillary loops of the glomeruli.

The incidence of lymphomas in 371 CAF1 mice injected with BALB/c spleen cells was compared with that in 324 control CAF1 mice. A high incidence of lymphomas was found in the treated mice, but not in the control animals. The development of the neoplasms was a function of the number of parental cells administered. Analyses of the injected mice for the presence of donor cells indicated that the majority of the injected parental cells lost antihost activity, probably within 24 hr of their administration. The tumors were of host origin, as judged by transplantation tests and antigenic analysis of tumor cells.	CHRONIC ALLOGENEIC DISEASE II. DEVELOPMENT OF LYMPHOMAS	Martine Y. K.

Antibodies to DNA and RNA were induced in young NZB/NZW F1 (B/W) female mice following multiple injections of the interferon-inducer polyinosinic·polycytidylic acid (poly I·poly C). Despite serum concentrations of interferon adequate to inhibit the C-type murine leukemia viruses, there was an acceleration of the autoimmune disease in these animals. Anti-RNA, but not anti-DNA antibodies, were induced in B/W male mice, as well as in NZB and NZW mice. Anti-RNA antibodies were also found in 50 per cent of female B/W mice who had never received poly I·poly C and in 8 of 24 sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.These results suggest that double-stranded RNA functions as a potent antigen in New Zealand mice. Naturally occurring nucleic acids (e.g., viruses) probably act as stimuli to a genetically hyperreactive immune system. According to this hypothesis, the unusual feature in this disease is not a unique virus, but rather the unique genetic susceptibility of the B/W (particularly female) host to immunization with nucleic acids. A similar pathogenetic mechanism may be operative in some humans with systemic lupus erythematosus.	THE PATHOGENESIS OF AUTOIMMUNITY IN NEW ZEALAND MICE, I.

Labelling studies with tritiated thymidine in NZB mice revealed that old mice of this strain with established Coombs positive haemolytic anaemia were depleted predominantly of long-lived small lymphocytes. Lymphopoiesis in the bonemarrow was relatively less affected suggesting that the peripheral destruction or deviation of re-circulating lymphocytes and not a precursor cell deficiency may account for the depletion of these cells. Old NZB mice in which the development of Coombs positive haemolytic anaemia, but not other disease features, has been prevented by thymectomy and treatment with anti-lymphocyte globulin several months earlier were equally deficient in this population of lymphocytes. C57BL mice, subjected to the same regime largely regenerated this population during the subsequent 12 months and rejected skin homografts in the same time as young controls of the same strain. Loss of lymphocytes responsible for antigen recognition would account for the impaired cellular immunity of old NZB mice observed in this study and described earlier by other authors. This process appears to accompany the progression of the spontaneous disease in this strain.ImagesFig. 2Fig. 3	Depletion of long-lived lymphocytes in old New Zealand black mice	A. M. Denman, Evelyn J. Denman	4920597	1970-04-01	15	
Naturally occurring thymocytotoxic autoantibody (NTA) was detected by cytotoxic test in the sera of very young New Zealand Black mice (within 1 month after birth); the incidence was 100% at 3 months of age. Some mice from other strains also had NTA, but at an older age and with lower incidence and antibody titer. NTA had optimal activity at 4°C but was also strongly reactive at 37°C. It was cytotoxic for thymocytes of all strains of mice tested. Whereas only thymocytes were highly sensitive to NTA, the reactive antigen was demonstrated by absorption test in the thymus, lymph node, spleen, and brain of adult mice. It could be demonstrated only in the thymus of newborn mice.The distribution of NTA-reactive antigen suggests the presence of an antigen distinct from any so far described on the cell surface of mouse thymocytes. Gel filtration of NZB mouse serum suggests that NTA is an IgM. Mouse thymocytes sensitized with NTA in vitro became highly susceptible to phagocytosis by syngeneic macrophages.Images	Natural Thymocytotoxic Autoantibody and Reactive Antigen in New Zealand Black and Other Mice	Toshikazu Shirai, Robert C.

The influence of ageing on the in vitro responses of mouse spleen cells to phytohaemagglutinin and to allogeneic cells was studied in NZB, (NZB×A)F1, A and CBA mice. These responses decline with ageing in those strains which are genetically susceptible to autoimmune disease (NZB, (NZB×A)F1 and A) but not in a non-susceptible strain (CBA). These studies support the view that cellular immunity declines with advancing age in autoimmune-susceptible mice, and suggests that the decline is due to a progressive loss of the thymus-dependent cell pool.

Native calf thymus DNA was labelled in vitro with tritiated actinomycin-D or tritiated dimethyl sulphate. These chemical methods yield DNA of high specific activity, without degradation or detectable alteration in reactivity with antibody to nucleic acid. The labelling procedures are simple, rapid and capable of producing relatively large amounts of radioactive DNA. Furthermore, they are applicable to a wide range of molecules of interest in the study of nucleic acid antibodies.The labelled DNA was used in the ammonium sulphate precipitation technique to demonstrate DNA antibodies in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Whereas only nineteen of thirty-seven sera studied had demonstrable precipitins, thirty-three had significant binding ability for native DNA with this more sensitive assay. Serial studies on sera from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus illustrate the value of this assay system for following the course of the disease.

A gel diffusion method for demonstrating precipitin reactions of C1q with aggregated γ-globulin and immune complexes is described. Optimal precipitin lines were found to occur with 0.6 per cent agarose in 0.01 M EDTA at pH 7.2 and ionic strength 0.1. Reduction and alkylation of γ-globulin aggregates destroyed the precipitability with C1q. Precipitation occurred only with aggregates greater than 19S and with soluble immune complexes formed in two to twenty times antigen excess. γ-Globulin complexes were detected by this procedure in hypocomplementaemic sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and hypocomplementaemic joint fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The relevance of this in vitro system to in vivo complement consumption in various disease states is discussed.ImagesFIG. 1FIG. 2FIG. 5FIG. 6	Precipitin reactions of the C1q component of complement with aggregated γ-globulin and immune complexes ingeldiffusion	V.

The Moloney strain of murine sarcoma virus (MSV-M) rapidly induces soft tissue tumours in mice of all ages. Immunologically competent mice can spontaneously regress these tumours, and the regression time is an indication of the degree of immunologic reactivity. Using these parameters, New Zealand Black (NZB), New Zealand White × New Zealand Black F1 (B/W), and NIH Swiss mice develop cell mediated immune responses at an early age compared to five other mouse strains. 8–11-month-old NZB and B/W mice of both sexes show depressed immune responses when compared to 6-week-old controls. The responses of 10–11 month old female BALB/c mice were identical to 6-week-old controls. Older NZB and B/W mice spontaneously develop autoimmune disease. Measurement of autoimmune parameters in the older New Zealand mouse strains indicates that immune depression precedes the onset of detectable autoimmune disease.

Serum monoclonal macroglobulins were detected in over 30% of NZB/NZW F1 mice greater than 11 mo of age. The monoclonal nature of the IgM was shown by restricted electrophoretic mobility, characteristic appearance on immunoelectrophoresis, restriction to a single light chain type, and ability to induce anti-idiotypic antisera. The monoclonal macroglobulins were separated from antibodies to DNA and RNA that migrated in the 7S region of sucrose gradients. Enlarged lymph nodes were often present in mice with monoclonal IgM, and a transplantable IgM-producing lymphoid tumor was established from the spleen of one animal.

Immunologic tolerance to ultracentrifuged bovine gamma globulin could not be induced in 6-wk old NZB or B/W mice, but developed readily in C3H, NZW, and C57Bl mice. NZB and B/W mice, as well as Balb/c mice, failed to become tolerant to ultracentrifuged human gamma globulin. The NZB and B/W mice also showed higher antibody titers to a standard antigenic challenge. This immunologic hyperreactivity and lack of experimental tolerance may be related to the lack of self-tolerance, autoimmunity, and lymphomas that develop in these mice at a later age.

Thymocytes from NZB and DBA/2 mice were injected into lethally irradiated C57 B1/6 recipients. DNA synthesis in spleen and lymph node was measured as the incorporation of radioactive 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. The generation of cytotoxic effector cells was also studied in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay, with EL-4 lymphoma target cells. The kinetics of DNA synthesis were similar for 2- and 8-week-old DBA/2 donors and for 2-week-old NZB donors with a peak on day 4. Thymocytes from 8-week-old and 9-month-old NZB donors showed a delayed onset of DNA synthesis which was still increasing on day 6. When NZB donor thymocytes from 2- and 8-week-old mice were mixed together before injections, as few as 25% of 8-week-old cells gave a DNA synthetic response characteristic of this aged population. These results suggest an abnormal thymocyte development in NZB mice which may relate to the subsequent emergence of autoimmune disease.

NZB mice naturally produce an autoantibody which in the presence of complement is specifically cytotoxic for thymocytes and thymus-dependent lymphocytes (T-cells) in the peripheral lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes and spleen) and the circulation of mice. Using a direct cytotoxicity test with a NZB mouse serum pool which contained the high titred autoantibody, a progressive decrease was observed with age in the proportion of the autoantibody-sensitive cells in mesenteric lymph node, spleen, and blood of NZB mice in comparison with mice of other strains (C57BL/6J and NZW). The numerical decrease in the population of autoantibody-sensitive cells was evident at younger age and greater degree in the peripheral blood than in the lymph node and spleen. The age-decrease in the number of autoantibody-sensitive cells in lymph node and spleen contrasted with the numerical increase in nucleated cells in these organs. The age-decrease in the proportion and number of the autoantibody-sensitive cells in the blood exceeded the decrease in the blood lymphocyte count. This finding indicated that T-cells in the blood are selectively depleted with the ageing of NZB mice. A similar observation was made on the blood lymphocytes of (NZB × NZW)F1 hybrid mice. The depletion of T-cells in the blood in association with the production of natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody is termed autoimmune thymus-dependent lymphocytopenia.

New Zealand Black (NZB) mice and (B/W) F1 hybrids have a normal level of serum `thymic activity' (TA) at birth but this level decreases prematurely between the third and sixth weeks of life. At 2 months, NZB and NZ (B/W) F1 mice have no significant TA, whereas TA is still at birth's level in six control mouse strains and remains at this level until the fourth to the sixth month. Six weeks after the decline of serum TA, NZB mice show disappearance of theta-positive lymph node rosette-forming cells (RFC) and 2 weeks later, progressive decrease in spleen RFC sensitivity to anti-theta serum (AΘS) and azathioprine (AZ) as in neonatally thymectomized CBA mice. Normal AZ and AΘS sensitivity of spleen and lymph node RFC is reconstituted by in vitro or in vivo treatment by thymic extracts. The early thymic abnormalities found in NZB mice are in keeping with the thymic medullar epithelium atrophy reported in newborn NZB mice.	Studies on thymus products. IV.

A new cytolytic pathway is described whereby cells sensitized with cytotoxic antibody can be specifically lysed in the complete absence of intact, classical complement pathway function. Evaluation of this model with sera deficient in the 4th (C4), 2nd (C2), and 6th (C6) components of complement has revealed that this new lytic mechanism, termed the C1-bypass activation pathway, is initiated by the antibody-mediated activation of C1. Utilizing components of the previously described alternate complement pathway, this pathway bypasses C4 and C2 to activate the third to ninth components of complement (C3-9) with induction of membrane damage.Images	A New Complement-Mediated Cytolytic Mechanism—the C1-Bypass Activation Pathway	Joseph E.

Serum levels of complement components and of C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) were measured serially in two patients with membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis who were subjected to bilateral nephrectomy and maintained by peritoneal dialysis for 2 wk before renal transplantation. In both patients, low levels of C3 and high levels of preformed alpha 2D, a C3 breakdown product, were present before nephrectomy and remained essentially unchanged during the anephric period. With transplantation, C3 levels rose towards normal and alpha 2D disappeared from the serum. The serum of both patients contained detectable amounts of C3NeF, a factor which has been shown to react with a cofactor found in normal serum to form an enzyme, designated C3 lytic nephritic factor (C3LyNeF), which will cleave C3 to form the breakdown products, β1A and alpha 2D. The level of C3NeF was high in one patient before nephrectomy, increased somewhat during the anephric period, and fell after transplantation. In the other patient, the C3NeF level was initially lower, remained relatively constant during the anephric period, and was not significantly affected by transplantation. In both patients, levels of C4 and C5 were either normal or elevated over the period of the study and bore no relationship to the C3 level. The following conclusions can be drawn from the data. The high levels of alpha 2D during the anephric period and the disappearance of this protein as C3 levels approach normal at the time of transplantation indicate that the low C3 levels were largely the result of C3 breakdown rather than diminished synthesis. The presence of C3NeF in detectable amounts in both patients suggest that C3LyNeF, formed by the reaction of C3NeF and cofactor, was responsible for the low C3 levels. Finally, the lack of effect of nephrectomy on C3, alpha 2D, and C3NeF levels indicate that the site of C3 breakdown was extrarenal and that C3NeF and cofactor are at least in large part of extrarenal origin.Images	Continuing C3 breakdown after bilateral nephrectomy in patients with membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis	Enrique H.

Serological and immunopathological studies of human glomerulonephritis have suggested that alternate pathways of activation of the third component of complement may be important in some forms of glomerulonephritis. We have investigated the role of two alternate pathway proteins, properdin and C3 proactivator, in 22 patients with chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 21 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 20 patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and 19 patients with other forms of renal disease. C3 (measured at β1A), properdin, and C3 proactivator were assayed by single radial immunodiffusion.In sera with low β1A (< 2 SD), mean properdin was most significantly decreased in patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis but was also significantly decreased in chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and in untreated systemic lupus erythematosus. Properdin levels in other renal disease, acute glomerulonephritis, and chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with normal β1A levels were not significantly different from normal. A positive correlation between β1A and properdin levels in individual sera was present in all diseases except systemic lupus erythematosus.Serum C3 proactivator was markedly decreased in active systemic lupus erythematosus and there was a positive correlation between β1A and C3 proactivator levels in systemic lupus erythematosus and other renal diseases but not acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.Properdin in fresh sera from four patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and five with chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis showed increased migration toward the cathode on immunoelectrophoresis, suggesting in vivo change of the properdin molecule.The observation of reduced serum levels of properdin and C3 proactivator and altered electrophoretic migration of properdin in some patients with glomerulonephritis provide new evidence for participation of these alternate pathway proteins in glomerulonephritis.Images	Properdin and C3 Proactivator: Alternate Pathway Components in Human Glomerulonephritis	Robert H.

Membranoproliferative nephritis in children is frequently associated with a hypocomplementemia produced at least in part by C3 breakdown mediated by a circulating anticomplementary factor known as C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF). C3 breakdown by this factor in vitro requires the presence of a pseudoglobulin cofactor and magnesium. The present study provides evidence that properdin factor B (C3 proactivator) is activated in the nephritic factor reaction and is the direct mediator of C3 breakdown by C3NeF. Depletion of factor B from mixtures of normal human serum (NHS) and plasma from a patient with membranoproliferative nephritis (MPP), either by heating or by immune equivalence absorption, blocks C3 breakdown by C3NeF. Addition of purified factor B to these mixtures restores the anticomplementary effect. When purified factor B is added to mixtures of MPP and purified C3, breakdown also occurs. Associated with the C3 breakdown is a change in the electrophoretic mobility of factor B from the beta to the gamma position, a shift which has been associated with cleavage activation of the molecule. Further, serum factor B levels are often low in patients with membranoproliferative nephritis and bear a rough inverse correlation with C3NeF levels. It thus appears that factor B is the previously described heat-labile C3NeF cofactor. Whether the C3NeF reaction proceeds via a pathway comparable to that activated by the cobra venom factor or via that activated by zymosan or inulin cannot be determined from the present data.Images	Hypocomplementemia of Membranoproliferative Nephritis DEPENDENCE OF THE NEPHRITIC FACTOR REACTION ON PROPERDIN FACTOR B	Edward J.

The study of the activation of C3, C5, and C7 associated with the conversion of C3 in the serum of a 9-yr old girl after incubation at 0°C for 6-8 h without utilization of C1, C4, and C2 is described. The patient has upper respiratory infections associated with recurrent gross hematuria, focal glomerulonephritis, and transient renal insufficiency. Histological lesions demonstrated the presence of B1c globulin IgA and properdin in the glomeruli. The activation of complement (C) in the cold requires the patient's IgA. Removal of IgA from the serum by immunoadsorption prevents activation and conversion of C3. Bactericidal and phagocytic activity is also impaired after incubation. C3 proactivator (C3PA) level is reduced before and after incubation. Properdin level drops after incubation. These findings suggest that the activation of C3 which is demonstrable in vitro may be a continuous process in vivo.Images	The Association of Respiratory Infection, Recurrent Hematuria, and Focal Glomerulonephritis with Activation of the Complement System in the Cold	Noorbibi K.

Antibody to DNA was measured before and after treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sera with bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (DNase I). In 11 of 15 cases of SLE with active renal disease there was a significant increase in DNA-binding after DNase digestion, while no such increase was noted in inactive SLE, normal controls or in patients with nonlupus renal disease. The significant rise in DNA-binding after digestion indicated that DNA had bound in vivo to the anti-DNA in these sera. A striking correlation between the occurrence of these complexes and disease activity was shown. In eight cases of SLE nephritis where serial blood samples were obtained, the greatest increase in DNA-binding after DNase digestion occurred at the time of the severest renal disease. In addition, serum from a case of SLE with acute cerebritis but without evidence of renal disease also had a significant rise in binding during the acute phase. This assay provides proof of the existence of circulating DNA:anti-DNA complexes in some cases of SLE and can also be used to measure an apparently critical parameter of disease activity.Images	DNA:Anti-DNA Complexes: Their Detection in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Sera	Ronald J.

These observations established the presence of anti-GBM antibodies in the sera and/or kidneys of six humans with glomerulonephritis. Further, it seems clear that these antibodies do combine with the host's glomeruli in vivo and with GBM antigen of several species in vitro. Transfer of acute glomerulonephritis to normal recipient monkeys was possible with serum or renal eluate IGG from the three patients with anti-GBM antibodies in whom sufficient material was available. Based on this transfer of nephritis and on the presence of these antibodies at the site of injury in the nephritic kidneys of both the patients and the recipient monkeys, it seems likely that they are at least a contributing, if not primary, cause of the glomerular injury. The frequency of anti-GBM antibodies in human nephritis is not certain, but on the basis of preliminary observations it would appear that they are present in all cases of Goodpasture's nephritis and somewhat less than half of the cases of subacute and chronic glomerulonephritis of adults. The nature and source of immunogen stimulating the production of anti-GBM antibodies is not known, but the presence of potentially nephritogenic GBM antigens in normal urine raises the question of possible autoimmunization. From a practical point of view, it appears that patients forming anti-GBM antibodies may not be good candidates for renal transplantation since they are likely to produce in the transplants the nephritic changes already suffered by their own kidneys.

Complexes of IgG—rheumatoid factor (RF) and IgG—β1C were demonstrated in the synovial membrane obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by a mixed immunofluorescence method that shows simultaneously the two components of the complex.IgG—RF was found only in the synovia of cases with circulating RF, while IgG—β1C deposits could be detected in both seropositive and seronegative cases.These findings are discussed in connection with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid synovitis in the light of the immune complex pathogenetic mechanism.ImagesFIGS. 1-7FIG. 8	Immune complexes in rheumatoid synovitis: a mixed staining immunofluorescence study	L.

Cultures of human peripheral leucocytes were stimulated to incorporate tritiated thymidine when incubated with monkey antisera to human immunoglobulins. Twenty-five of forty-four monkey antisera were active and stimulated 90 per cent of leucocyte (WBC) cultures to incorporate a small but significantly greater amount of tritiated thymidine (TdR3H) than that incorporated by controls. This stimulation of TdR3H uptake correlated with an increase from 2 to 8 per cent lymphoblasts in the cultures. Leucocytes washed free of serum immunoglobulins responded to a greater degree to the anti-immunoglobulin sera than when they were cultured in the presence of human serum. Prior absorption of antisera with either whole serum or homologous immunoglobulin blocked antiserum stimulation completely. The anti-IgG and anti-IgM antisera were consistently more effective than anti-IgA, anti-κ and anti-λ chain antisera. Sequential stimulation by antisera against two different immunoglobulins was not significantly different from those stimulated by only one of the two. Lymphocytes from three asymptomatic subjects with low or absent serum IgA levels transformed as well with anti-IgA as did lymphocytes from subjects with normal serum IgA levels. Antisera were cytotoxic to the lymphocytes only in the presence of complement. Presumably the transformation of human lymphocytes was due to a reaction of anti-immunoglobulin antisera with specific immunoglobulin antigenic determinants present on or in the circulating lymphocytes.

Complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes coated with optimal concentrations of rabbit IgG hemolysin was inhibited by euglobulin fractions from the sera of patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. That this was due to direct interaction with the IgG coat on the red cell rather than a nonspecific reaction with complement in the fluid phase was confirmed by controls using cells coated with IgM hemolysin. The inhibitory activity was recovered in purified IgM rheumatoid factor preparations and could be absorbed out with insoluble aggregated human IgG. The inhibitory potency of the rheumatoid factors correlated well with their sheep cell agglutination titers. Inhibition was not the result of physical aggregation of the erythrocytes by rheumatoid factor. Kinetic studies were consistent with the view that rheumatoid factor displaces C1q from its binding to IgG. Paradoxically, at suboptimal sensitizing concentrations of IgG hemolysin, rheumatoid factor enhances the fixation of complement. These results can be interpreted on the basis of the blockage of complement fixation by IgG and its replacement by a relatively weak direct fixation by the IgM rheumatoid factor. Thus, the interaction of RF with IgG generates only a limited ability to fix complement which, when contrasted with the fixation at suboptimal concentrations of IgG hemolysin alone, appears as net enhancement; when this is contrasted with fixation occurring with optimal concentrations of IgG, it appears as net inhibition.

An initial separation of reaction stages in immune cytoxicity is described. Primary isolates of normal human amnion cells were reacted first with specific rabbit γ2-globulin antibody, then with human C'1 esterase in the presence of Ca++, and finally with human C'2, C'3, and C'4 in the presence of Mg++. Cytotoxicity, as measured by uptake of trypan blue, occurred only when these reactions were performed in the order given and did not occur when any of the constituents was omitted. Inhibition of immune cytotoxicity was achieved with partially purified preparations of human serum inhibitor of C'1 esterase under certain experimental conditions. The data are discussed in relation to the role of C'1 esterase in initiating complement action and the partial biochemical definition of an early event in immune cytotoxicity.

Equilibrium measurements of interactions of anti-DNP antibodies, prepared using DNP-PLL and several DNP-proteins for immunization, with DNP0.6-PLL240 and with the univalent hapten, ε-DNP-L-lysine, were made utilizing the technique of fluorescence quenching. Carrier specificity of anti-DNP-PLL antibodies was demonstrated by a higher average intrinsic association constant (K0) of anti-DNP-PLL antibodies with DNP0.6-PLL240 than with ε-DNP-L-lysine. The free energy contribution of the PLL carrier to the interaction of intact anti-DNP-PLL antibodies with DNP0.6-PLL240 was from –0.8 to –2.1 kcal/mole. On the other hand, intact anti-DNP-protein antibodies displayed a lower energy of interaction with DNP0.6-PLL240 than with ε-DNP-L-lysine of up to +2.4 kcal/mole. Fab' fragments of both anti-DNP-PLL and anti-DNP-BGG antibodies have K0's with ε-DNP-L-lysine identical to the K0's of the intact anti-DNP antibodies from which they were prepared. However, K0 of interaction of Fab' fragments with DNP0.6-PLL240 (a large proportion of the conjugated PLL molecules in this preparation bear more than one DNP group) is considerably lower than that of the intact antibody. Thus a cooperative effect in the binding of bivalent antibody and bivalent (or greater) antigen exists and is of the order of –1.2 to –2.0 kcal/mole of IgG antibody. Although the direct contribution of the carrier to the interaction of Fab' fragment of anti-DNP-PLL and DNP0.6-PLL240 is –0.4 kcal/mole, the energy of carrier specificity, based upon consideration of cooperative effects and of repulsion of anti-DNP-protein antibodies for portions of the DNP-PLL determinants, is of the order of –3 kcal/mole (approximately 30% of total binding energy).

Rabbit antisera prepared against conjugates of the benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) bifunctional haptenic group were analyzed to determine whether the antibodies are adapted to only a portion of the large BPO molecule, or to the entire molecule, and whether specificity extends to the lysine side chain and adjoining structures of the immunizing carrier protein. No antibodies adapted to the phenylacetylamine portion of the BPO group could be detected in a pooled rabbit anti-BPO serum globulin fraction by PCA and quantitative precipitin analysis using several phenylacetylamine-protein conjugates as antigens. No antibodies adapted only to the thiazolidine carboxylic acid portion of the BPO molecule were detected in the anti-BPO globulin fraction using quantitative precipitin and hapten inhibition methods. At least the bulk of the anti-BPO antibodies was found to be adapted to the entire BPO haptenic group. By quantitative hapten inhibition of precipitation of the anti-BPO globulin fraction, the anti-BPO antibodies were found to show specificity for a 6 carbon amide side chain corresponding to the lysine side chain through which BPO groups are bound predominantly to protein. The contribution of this 6 carbon chain to antibody-hapten binding was small; (–ΔF°) was calculated to be 460 calories per mole (average). Rabbit anti-BPO antibodies prepared against BPO-rabbit serum albumin conjugates showed specificity also toward structures of the immunizing carrier protein, and possibly toward secondary or tertiary structural configurations. Penicilloyl conjugates of rabbit serum albumin precipitated from 3 individual rabbit antisera more anti-BPO antibodies than did penicilloyl conjugates of heterologous carriers (poly-L-lysine, human serum albumin, and human γ-globulin). Anti-BPO antibodies demonstrated heterogeneity with regard to closeness of fit to the haptenic group, or with regard to the dimensions of the combining sites, or both. It was concluded that at least a large part of anti-BPO antibodies are specifically adapted to a large antigenic unit comprised of the entire BPO group, the lysine side chain, and structural configurations of the immunizing carrier protein.

Forty-one patients with acceptable past histories of allergic reactions to benzylpenicillin (PG), eleven patients with questionable histories to PG and thirty patients without past histories of allergic reactions to PG were skin tested with various multivalent haptenic conjugates and with simple chemicals derived from PG in order to determine the antigenic specificities of penicillin hypersensitivity of the wheal-and-flare type. The benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) group was found to be the major haptenic determinant of wheal-and-flare type PG hypersensitivity. Twenty-nine per cent of patients with acceptable histories of PG allergy and 3 per cent of patients without histories of PG allergy gave positive wheal-and-flare reactions to multivalent BPO-conjugates. Three patients who had unusual clinical forms of PG allergic reactions demonstrated patterns of wheal-and-flare reactivity indicating D-penicillamine or D-benzylpenamaldic acid disulphide haptenic specificity. No unequivocal wheal-and-flare reactivity specific for the benzylpenicillenic acid haptenic group was observed in this study. Data were obtained which indicate that BPO-specific wheal-and-flare skin reactivity demonstrates specificity for the entire large BPO haptenic group, and also for structural areas of the immunizing autologous hapten-carrier protein (i.e. carrier specificity).

"Experiments carried out with several well defined antigenic systems (hapten conjugates of poly-L-lysine and guinea pig serum albumin) in guinea pigs demonstrated that: 1. Arthus reactions also manifest carrier specificity, although to a smaller extent than do delayed hypersensitivity reactions. 2. Desensitization by injection of minute doses of antigen results in moderate specific desensitization of delayed hypersensitivity without desensitization of Arthus reactivity to the same antigenic determinant. 3. Insoluble antigen-antibody complexes prepared from high affinity guinea pig antibodies can elicit specific delayed skin reactions in sensitized guinea pigs. 4. Homologous conjugates of structurally similar haptens show considerably less cross-reactivity in delayed reactions than in immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the same antigenic determinant. These experimental results are interpreted as indicating that delayed hypersensitivity reactions in the guinea pig are mediated by ""antibodies"" of comparatively high binding affinities. High binding affinities are achieved for these antibodies more likely by closer structural adaptation between antigen and antibody than by a larger area of specific contact."

30 to 40% of Hartley strain guinea pigs have previously been demonstrated to possess a dominant autosomal gene which enables them to recognize the antigenicity of hapten-poly-L-lysine conjugates as expressed by the development of both antihapten antibodies and delayed hypersensitivity to the immunizing antigen. In the present study, it was shown that PLL alone was weakly antigenic in such genetic responder animals. Immunization with DNP-PLL electrostatically combined with foreign albumins elicits the production of anti-DNP antibodies in all Hartley strain guinea pigs, although the percentage of animals demonstrating a delayed response to DNP-PLL and therefore considered genetic responders remains 30 to 40%. Immunization with nonantigenic polyanions combined with DNP-PLL does not produce such an effect. Some degree of PLL specificity of purified anti-DNP antibodies produced by genetic nonresponder animals by immunization with DNP-PLL combined with foreign albumins was demonstrated by means of fluorescence quenching.

Hartley guinea pigs genetically unresponsive to hapten-PLL (poly-L-lysine) conjugates were lethally irradiated and given allogeneic bone marrow from Hartley responder animals. Many of the animals died of graft versus host disease before their response to 2,4-dinitrophenyl-PLL (DNP-PLL) could be measured. The immune response of the surviving recipient animals was evaluated by anti-DNP antibody production, development of delayed hypersensitivity to DNP-poly-L-lysine, as well as by lymph node cell stimulation in vitro by this antigen. 12 of 14 recipient animals thus treated made an immune response as measured by 2 of the 3 parameters. Strain 13 guinea pigs, genetically unable to respond immunologically to DNP-PLL and to DNP-GL (2,4-dinitrophenyl-L-glutamic acid L-lysine copolymer) were lethally irradiated and given bone marrow from (2 x 13) F1 responder animals or strain 13 bone marrow and (2 x 13) F1 lymph node and spleen cells. A high proportion of the animals survived this procedure; no evidence of graft versus host disease was observed. Three of three strain 13 animals irradiated and, given strain 13 bone marrow and (2 x 13) F1 lymph node and spleen, and then immunized with DNP-PL, made a specific immune response. 7 of 10 irradiated strain 13 animals given strain 13 bone marrow and (2 x 13) F1 lymph node and spleen made an immune response to DNP-GL. However, only one of six irradiated strain 13 animals made a vigorous immune response to DNP-GL after reconstitution with (2 x 13) F1 bone marrow alone. The ability to transfer the immune response to PLL antigens from responder to nonresponder animals demonstrates unequivocally that the defect in the non-responder animals is immunological rather than due to some other type of non-immunological mechanism. The bone marrow contains all the immunological cells necessary for the expression of the PLL gene. However, the finding that (2 x 13) F1 lymph node and spleen cells were more effective than (2 x 13)F1 bone marrow cell populations (known to be a rich source of monocyte precursors) suggests that the cells in which the PLL gene function is expressed may be lymphocytes rather than monocytes and macrophages.

The ability of guinea pigs to respond immunologically to dinitrophenyl (DNP)-poly-L-arginine, DNP-protamine, DNP polyornithine, and to unsubstituted poly-L-arginine and protamine is linked to the presence of the poly-L-lysine gene. This gene has previously been demonstrated to control the immune response of guinea pigs to poly-L-lysine, to a copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-lysine and to haptenic derivatives of these materials.Although the ability to respond to each of these highly charged compounds is linked to the presence of the poly-L-lysine gene, the cellular immune responses to these antigens is highly individually specific.

The data presented demonstrate linkage between the major histocompatibility locus of inbred strain 2 guinea pigs and a „specific immune response gene,” the PLL gene, which controls responsiveness to poly-L-lysine and hapten conjugates of this polypeptide in these animals. This finding extends to another species and to a different immune system the linkage observed in mice between the H2 locus and specific immune response genes at the Ir-1 locus. The general significance of the linkage of specific immune response genes to histocompatibility loci is discussed.

Upon immunization with LDH-III (subunit composition AABB) rabbits produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies in comparable amounts. These antibodies fit equally well to the hybrid enzyme and to LDH-V (AAAA) or LDH-I (BBBB) respectively, as tested by passive hemagglutination inhibition. No antibodies reacting with both LDH-I and LDH-V were detected. A minority of hybrid-specific antibodies was, however, present in the sera. Animals primed with LDH-III respond regularly to a boosting injection of LDH-V with the production of large amounts of anti-A (but not anti-B) antibodies. A similar injection of LDH-I stimulates (if it has any effect at all) the production of anti-B antibodies only. Stimulation with one of the pure types does not impair a subsequent response to the other. The majority of the animals primed with LDH-III responded not at all or weakly to a boosting injection of LDH-I, though antibodies to LDH-I were present in the sera at the time of stimulation. This effect can hardly be explained on the basis of serological sepcificity. Hyporesponsiveness to LDH-III can be induced by injection of LDH-V into the newborn. Both anti-A and anti-B titers are equally depressed. Within the dose range tested, LDH-I does not exert any tolerogenic action with respect to LDH-III. The carrier property of subunit A is evident in the induction of both immunity and tolerance to LDH-III. The early phase of the immune response to the hybrid enzyme may be carrier-specific, and receptors for the haptenic subunit B may not exist at that stage.

In response to a second injection of rabbits with a dinitrophenylated antigen, given 2 months to 2 yr after the first injection, there was rapid synthesis of large amounts of antibody high in relative affinity for the dinitrophenyl (DNP) determinant. The antibodies formed 3 days after restimulation were already high in affinity. Amounts of antigen too small to elicit detectable antibody production may prime the animal for a partial secondary response characterized by the formation of antibody of intermediate affinity after a second antigenic stimulus. Investigations into the specificity requirements for the secondary response indicated that variation in the carrier protein and in the haptenic determinant could be tolerated. Thus, after immunization with DNP-bovine γ-globulin, DNP-hemocyanin elicited the vigorous production of high affinity anti-DNP antibodies. However, DNP serum albumin was much less effective: it elicited a secondary response in some animals primed with DNP-bovine γ-globulin only when the interval between injections was increased from 10 to 28 wk. A secondary response was also evoked when the haptenic determinent of the second immunogen differed slightly from that of the one injected initially (i.e., 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl versus 2,4-dinitrophenyl).

"In vitro antigen stimulation of DNA synthesis in lymph node cultures from immunized guinea pigs can be obtained with very low (10–4 µg/ml) antigen concentrations in the culture fluid. Immunization with low doses of DNP-GPA leads to a cell population capable of being stimulated, on the average, by low concentration of antigen whereas immunization with large antigen doses results in a sensitive cell population requiring, on the average, high antigen concentrations for stimulation. These findings correlate well with the affinity for hapten of the serum antibodies produced by these guinea pigs. Both delayed reactions in vivo and DNA synthesis in vitro can be stimulated by hapten conjugated to proteins different from that used in primary immunization. However the immunizing conjugate is much more effective in terms of antigen concentration required for a given response. These results can be understood in terms of a thermodynamically driven interaction of antigen (or ""processed"" antigen) with cell-associated antibody."

Genetic nonresponder guinea pigs made tolerant to BSA and then immunized with DNP-PLL·BSA failed to make anti-DNP-PLL antibodies. Thus, tolerance to a carrier protein renders animals unresponsive to the hapten which it bears. The addition in vitro of DNP-PLL or DNP-GL to lymph node cell cultures derived from genetic responder animals immunized with these materials led to a significant stimulation of 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. However, the addition of DNP-PLL or DNP-GL to lymph node cell cultures from nonresponder animals immunized with these materials failed to produce any stimulation of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the addition of DNP-PLL to lymph node cell cultures from nonresponder animals immunized with DNP-PLL·BSA or DNP-PLL·OVA also failed to stimulate cell proliferation in spite of the fact that the lymph node cells of these animals were producing anti-DNP-PLL antibodies. The above facts suggest that the function of the PLL gene product is to act at an early crucial step in the immune mechanism to form an antigen-inducer complex. The specificity of this early step may be of a simple order and different than that of the antibody which is later produced in the immune response.

Anamnestic antihapten responses were obtained to trinitrophenyl (TNP) when rabbits sensitized to trinitrophenyl-hemocyanin (TNP-KLH) were challenged with TNP-heterologous protein conjugates. Hapten-heterologous carrier conjugates elicited antihapten titers similar in magnitude to those elicited by the homologous carrier conjugate. Hapten-heterologous carrier recall of antihapten was successful as early as 37 days and as late as 11 months after sensitization. There was no correlation between anti-TNP-precipitating antibody titer after sensitization and the ability to respond to challenge by hapten-heterologous carrier. The results are discussed in terms of immunogenicity of sensitization, suppressive effects of persisting postsensitization antibody, and submolecular haptenic environment as factors possibly affecting the heterologous recall process.

Guinea-pigs immunized with DNP—BSA first produced anti-DNP antibodies of the γ2-class followed by anti-DNP antibodies of the γ1-class. The cellular localization of γ2 and γ1 immunoglobulins was investigated by immunofluorescence techniques during this shifting period. The γ2- and γ1-classes of immunoglobulins were, with few possible exceptions, produced in separate cells.

Rabbits primarily stimulated with a BSA (bovine serum albumin)-sulfanilic acid complex will produce a good secondary response to the sulfanilic acid hapten if the carrier used in the secondary stimulus is again BSA, and not if the secondary carrier is HGG (human gamma globulin). In the latter situation, a good secondary response is obtained, however, if the rabbits are pretreated a few weeks earlier with free HGG. We conclude that the immune stimulus involves the recognition of carrier determinants unrelated to the hapten. As the receptors for recognition of unrelated determinants are probably situated on different cells, we suggest that the immune stimulus leading to antibody formation requires the interaction of two antigen-bridged cells.

The amount of antibody produced by BSA-tolerant rabbits as a result of immunization with DNP—BSA is dependent upon the amount of BSA used to induce tolerance. Tolerance was induced by initial injection of 100 μg of antigen followed by progressively higher doses. Rabbits rendered tolerant with a maximum BSA dose of 1 mg had a mean serum anti-BSA antibody concentration of 0.39 mg/ml after immunization with DNP—BSA, whereas rabbits rendered tolerant with a maximum BSA dose of 100 mg had a mean serum anti-BSA concentration of 0.02 mg after the same course of immunization. This compares with a mean of 1.08 mg of anti-BSA antibody in normal rabbits immunized with DNP—BSA. There was a similar reduction in the concentration of anti-DNP antibodies and of conjugate-specific antibodies in the tolerant groups.The results are discussed in terms of a thermodynamically-controlled induction of tolerance in individual precursor cells.

Rabbits were immunized with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)—protein conjugates. Spleen cell suspensions were prepared and incubated in the presence of various DNP—protein conjugates, the proteins alone, and DNP—lysine. The antigen dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis was used as a measure of the antigenic `activity' of the DNP preparations. It was found that the cells were strongly stimulated by the DNP—protein conjugates used for immunization, and weakly stimulated by the protein alone. Highly substituted DNP—protein conjugates were markedly more effective than lightly substituted conjugates. DNP-conjugates with proteins other than the one used during immunization were inactive. DNP—lysine alone was inactive but inhibited stimulation by the DNP—protein conjugate used for immunization. The significance of these findings is discussed.

Wheal-and-erythema responses were studied in normal human volunteers and in a single human subject who is sensitive to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group. In the normal subjects, reactive skin sites were established by intradermal injection of purified rabbit antibody specific for the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group. In both the active and passively sensitized subjects, wheal-and-erythema was elicited by intradermal injection of a 2,4-dinitrophenyl protein, but not by injection of the same conjugate mixed with certain low molecular weight 2,4-dinitrophenyl haptens or with univalent fragments split by papain from anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody. The latter fragments, unlike intact, bivalent, antibody, do not sensitize normal human skin sites. From these and other observations it is concluded that the wheal-and-erythema response in human skin requires mutually multivalent antigen and antibody. This requirement suggests that multimolecular complexes, containing at least 2 antigen and 2 antibody molecules, are essential in the pathogenesis of this allergic response.

Mitotic blocking agents, colchicine or Velban, were used to estimate cycle times of spleen cells which release hemolysin for sheep erythrocytes (plaque-forming cells). The cells were obtained either from rats immunized with sheep erythrocytes or from cultures of mouse spleen cells immunized in vitro with the same antigen. 2, 3, or 4 days after immunization, animals or cell cultures were treated with mitotic blocking agents for periods of time ranging from 2.5 to 7 hr; plaque-forming cells were then enumerated. Decreased numbers of plaque-forming cells were found after such treatment. The extent of reduction was a function of duration of the drug treatment and the method of immunization, but was independent of the time after immunization. The evidence presented is consistent with premises that: (a) plaque-forming cells in mitosis do not release sufficient antibody to be detected, (b) mitotic blocking agents, by arresting plaque-forming cells in metaphase, prevent not only detection of these cells but also the increase in number of plaque-forming cells which would have resulted from cell division, (c) mitotic blocking agents do not affect release of antibody by cells in interphase. Cell cycle times, based on the extent of reduction of plaque-forming cells per unit time of drug treatment, were estimated using a mathematical model appropriate for an exponentially increasing population of cells. Cell cycle times estimated using the mitotic blocking agents agreed well with cell doubling times calculated from the increase in plaque-forming cells occurring 1–4 days after immunization. Increased responses produced by higher antigen doses or treatment of immunized animals with an adjuvant resulted from an increased rate of division of responding cells and their progeny. The results are consistent with a cell selection theory of antibody formation. Antigenic stimulation causes relatively few cells to proliferate and to synthesize antibody; apparently the magnitude of the response is dependent primarily on the rate of division of responding cells. It is suggested on the basis of observations of in vitro-immunized cell cultures that the rate of division of responding cells may be dependent on the rate of interaction between two cell types, both of which are essential for the in vitro plaque-forming cell response.

A method has been described for obtaining radioautographs of plaque-forming cells. The method permits radioautographic analyses of small numbers of plaque-forming cells amidst large populations of non-plaque-forming cells. Spleen cells that were pulse-labeled with tritiated thymidine could be categorized readily as labeled or not labeled. Using this method it was found that (a) at least 55% of plaque-forming cells which appear 3 days after a maximal stimulus of 4 x 108 sheep red cells are still capable of DNA synthesis, and must have arisen by cell proliferation; (b) the rate of proliferation of plaque-forming cells is proportional to the log of the dose of antigen; (c) the S period of plaque-forming cells is at least 2 hr, appears to be constant, and is not influenced by antigen dose. The results suggest that antigen stimulates proliferation of plaque-forming cells by hastening their transit through the G1 phase of the generative cycle.

A culture system for cell suspensions from mouse spleens has been described. The system provides adequate conditions for in vitro immunization on initial exposure to heterologous erythrocytes. The in vitro response closely parallels that observed in vivo with respect to size, early kinetics, antigen dose, and the inhibitory effect of passive antibody. The response of cultured cells differs in two respects from that seen in vivo. There is an increase in the ability to discriminate between different varieties of homologous erythrocytes and the in vitro response does not appear to be limited by whatever mechanisms regulate the in vivo response.

The role of proliferation in the development of 19S antibody-forming cells in the primary response has been investigated in an in vitro system. Spleen cell suspensions from normal, unimmunized mice were cultured in vitro in the presence of mammalian erythrocytes and the number of 19S hemolytic plaque-forming cells that arose 4 days later was measured. The hot pulse technique for the selective irradiation of those cells which synthesize DNA during a defined period of time has been described. The effect of such hot pulses administered at various times after the addition of antigen on the subsequent appearance of antibody-forming cells was determined. The results established that: (a) the onset of DNA synthesis does not start for approximately 24–32 hr after the addition of antigen, (b) essentially all the antibody-forming cells arise by cell division, and (c) different cell populations are involved in the response to two non-cross-reacting antigens.

In vitro synthesis of β1C and immune globulins by tissues from foetal, neonatal and adult guinea-pigs, rabbits, mice and rats, was studied using a combination of immunoelectrophoresis and autoradiography. Germ-free (GF) mice and rats of various ages were also included in an effort to evaluate maturation of serum protein formation in an environment free of living bacteria.In all these species IgM is the first immune globulin detected, and its production is most prominent in the spleen. Formation of IgM is correlated with the degree of maturity at birth which in turn is dependent upon the length of the gestation period. In guinea-pigs, and probably also in mice, early IgM synthesis is accompanied by the production of free L chains. In the guinea-pig IgM synthesis is followed by formation of IgG2. Production of IgG1 was first noted at 3–4 weeks of age.In GF animals IgM production by the spleen developed at the same time and to approximately the same degree as in conventional (CVL) animals. Under CVL conditions mesenteric lymph nodes of immature animals developed early and strong synthesis of IgG. In contrast, mesenteric lymph nodes from GF animals remained markedly inactive.Although β1C was produced by all lymphoid tissue, there was no correlation with immune globulin formation, and the influence of age was evident only in the liver. Liver synthesis of β1C was low during foetal or neonatal life, depending on the degree of maturity at birth, increased in young animals, and then decreased again in adulthood.ImagesFIG. 1FIG. 2FIG. 3FIG. 4FIG. 5FIG. 6FIG. 7FIG. 8FIG. 9	β1C and immune globulin formation in vitro by tissues from germ-free and conventional rodents of various ages	Vera J.

The immune response to foreign erythrocytes was studied in vitro. Two subpopulations of cells were prepared. One was a population of bone marrow-derived spleen cells, taken from thymectomized, irradiated, and bone marrow-reconstituted mice; there was evidence that most of the precursors of the PFC had been present in this cell population, but few PFC developed in cultures of these cells alone in the presence of immunogenic erythrocytes. Another cell suspension was made from spleens of mice which had been irradiated and injected with thymus cells and erythrocytes; these cells were called educated T cells. The two cell suspensions together allow the formation of PFC in the presence of the erythrocytes which were used to educate the T cells, but not in the presence of noncross-reacting erythrocytes. If bone marrow-derived cells and T cells were kept in culture together with two different species of erythrocytes, and if one of the erythrocytes had been used to educate the T cells, then PFC against each of the erythrocytes could be detected.

Immunological tolerance was induced by the exposure of mouse spleen cells to mixtures of polymerized flagellin and antibody in vitro for 6 hours, at 37°, prior to thorough washing and in vitro challenge with optimally immunogenic doses of polymerized flagellin. The induction of antibody-mediated tolerance depended critically on the ratio of antigen and antibody to which the cells were initially exposed. Low zone tolerance could be induced with subimmunogenic concentrations of monomeric flagellin, in amounts as low as 2 pg/ml (about 10-14 molar) and the appropriate concentration of antibody (a titre of 10-3). In contrast tolerance could not be induced with subimmunogenic concentrations of polymeric flagellin in the presence of a wide range of antibody doses.There was a remarkable similarity between the tolerant states obtained in vitro with tolerogenic doses of polymeric flagellin, and with immunogenic and subimmunogenic concentrations of flagellin in the presence of antibody, suggesting that the cellular basis of the tolerant state remains the same. An antigen-focussing hypothesis has been proposed to integrate the mechanisms of high zone and antibody-mediated tolerance at the cellular level.

The studies reported here demonstrate that immunocompetent lymphoid cells from allogeneic donor guinea pigs stimulate the synthesis of anti-DNP and anti-OVA antibodies by recipients previously primed with DNP-OVA. This allogeneic effect occurs spontaneously in the absence of any further anti-genic challenge. Furthermore, the transfer of allogeneic cells prepares DNP-OVA-primed recipients for a striking secondary anti-DNP response to DNP-BGG; this occurs in equal degree whether or not the cells are derived from BGG-primed donors. We suggest that the allogeneic cells function by virtue of a specific immunologic attack of grafted cells on host cells. This conclusion is made on the basis of the following evidence: (a) The failure of observing the phenomenon with L2C leukemia cells and irradiated strain 2 lymph node and spleen cells which, although capable of initiating a host-versus-graft response, are incapable of mediating graft-versus-host reactions; and (b) the inability of (strain 2 x strain 13) F1 hybrids to mediate the allogeneic effect in strain 13 recipients. The analysis of this phenomenon may offer a key to the delineation of mechanisms involved in the activation of precursors of antibody-forming cells.

"Four separate effects can be demonstrated when lymphoid cell suspensions are passed through columns of siliconed glass beads. (a) A temperature-dependent ""active adherence"" of phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and polymorphs. (b) A temperature-independent and selective trapping by ""physical adherence"" of particular classes of lymphoid cells, including certain antibody-forming cells. (c) A ""size-filtration"" effect that traps larger cells, but only becomes significant with beads below 100 µ in diameter. (d) A selective retention of damaged cells, which occurs with all columns under all conditions tested. An active adherence column technique has been developed to separate phagocytes from lymphocytes while minimizing selection within the lymphocyte population by physical adherence or size filtration. In less than 10 min at 37°C it reproducibly produces a preparation of mouse spleen lymphocytes >500-fold depleted of active macrophages, and approximately 50-fold depleted of active polymorphs, with good over-all cell recoveries and cell viability. The lymphocyte fraction appears fully active in its ability to initiate immune responses to at least two different antigens, but is changed in over-all composition and selectively depleted in certain classes of antibody-forming cells."

A graft-versus-host reaction was induced in F1 hybrid mice by the inoculation of spleen cells from one of the parental strains. One week later cultures for primary immunization in vitro against sheep red cells were initiated with the spleen cells of the recipients. It was found that the antibody response against sheep red cells was considerably inhibited in spleen cells from mice subjected to a graft-versus-host reaction as compared to the response of spleen cells from untreated mice. Furthermore, when spleen cells from animals subjected to a graft-versus-host reaction were cultured together with spleen cells from normal animals or animals preimmunized to sheep red cells, the antibody responses of the latter two cell populations were inhibited.The relation between these findings and the antigenic competition phenomenon is discussed and it is suggested that antigenic competition is caused by an non-specific inhibition of the antibody response, caused by secretion of locally acting factors or by inhibition of normal cells by direct contact with `active' cells, stimulated by antigen.

Antigenic competition between the Fc and Fab fragments of rabbit IgG in mice could be abolished by passive immunization with antiserum against the dominant antigen (Fc). The induction of tolerance to Fc also eliminated antigenic competition. Anti-Fd production, generally very poor in response to rabbit IgG, was considerably enhanced by these procedures, indicating that it is also subject to antigenic competition with Fc.A model is proposed to explain antigenic competition which proposes that it is the `co-operative antibody' produced to the dominant antigen which acts as an inhibitor to antibody production to the suppressed antigen by competing for sites —presumably on macrophage membranes—where co-operation occurs.The merits and difficulties of such an explanation are discussed.

Nonadherent mouse spleen cells exhibited poor viability and little or no capacity to form antibodies to sheep red cells in the Mishell-Dutton culture system. Viability and antibody-forming capacity could be restored by addition to these cultures of low concentrations of mercaptoethanol (10–4–10–5 M), or by addition of appropriate numbers of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Macrophage concentrations lower than optimal resulted in lower lymphoid cell viability and correspondingly fewer plaque-forming cells, whereas excess macrophages resulted in marked inhibition of antibody formation despite good viability of the lymphocytes. Restoration of the nonadherent cells with mercaptoethanol was thus much simpler and more reproducible than it was with macrophages; furthermore, the number of plaque-forming cells developed in cultures restored with mercaptoethanol was approximately fourfold higher than it was in cultures restored with optimal numbers of macrophages. In the presence of mercaptoethanol, the plaque-forming capacity of the nonadherent spleen cells was not increased when small numbers of macrophages were added to the system, nor was it decreased when the few macrophages present in the nonadherent cells were further reduced or eliminated. Excess macrophages inhibited antibody formation in the cultures containing mercaptoethanol as they did in control cultures. Optimal restoration of plaque-forming capacity to the nonadherent spleen cells with mercaptoethanol required the reducing agent to be present throughout the 4 or 5 day culture period. Addition of mercaptoethanol 1 or more days after initiation of culture, or transfer of the cells to a medium free of mercaptoethanol before completion of the culture resulted in a reduction in the numbers of plaque-forming cells. The results suggest that mouse lymphoid cells do not require macrophages in order to form antibodies to sheep red cells in vitro, provided mercaptoethanol is present in the culture medium. The mechanism of action of mercaptoethanol under these conditions is not completely clear, but one of its effects is to promote the viability of lymphoid cells in the cultures.

When normal mouse spleen, cells in suspension are cultured in vitro in the presence of polymer from S. adelaide flagellin, an immune response can be obtained as measured at the level of single antibody-forming cells. Cultures were stimulated with different doses of antigen, ranging from 0.2 ng to 3 µg/ml of tissue culture fluid and it was found that the peak number of approximately 500 antibody-forming cells per 106 harvested cells by day 4 was antigen dose dependent, 2–20 ng/ml being the optimal concentration. When more than 1 µg/ml of polymer from S. adelaide together with either 20 ng/ml of polymer from S. waycross or with 4 x 106 sheep erythrocytes were placed in the system, unresponsiveness to S. adelaide, but immunity to the other antigens occurred simultaneously. Cells made immunologically tolerant in vitro to S. adelaide H antigens were transferred into syngeneic lethally irradiated recipients and challenged with the same antigen. The adoptive immune capacity in these mice, as measured at the level of the immunologically competent cell was reduced by 80–90% as compared with relevant controls. Attempts to induce low zone tolerance in vitro were without success. To study the kinetics of tolerance induction in vitro, cells were cultured with tolerogenic doses of antigen for various periods of time, washed, and subsequently cultured with immunogenic doses of antigen for 4 days. It was found, that immunological tolerance may be induced to a significant degree in vitro within a period of 15 min. Similar results were obtained when spleen cells were exposed for various lengths of time to tolerogenic doses of antigen but at a temperature of 4°C instead of 37°C. The results are taken as suggestive evidence that the initial step in tolerance induction is related to the direct interaction between the surface of immune competent cells and antigen molecules.

Immunological tolerance to H antigens of Salmonella adelaide may be induced in vitro by the exposure of mouse spleen cells for 6 hr to an immunogenic dose of polymerized flagellin in the presence of low concentrations of specific antibody. Such antibody-mediated tolerance requires an optimal antigen: antibody ratio for its induction. A shift in this ratio in favor of the antibody concentration results in failure of tolerance induction and leads to immune suppression commonly known as antibody-mediated feedback inhibition which is not analogous to immunological tolerance. Fragment A of flagellin fails to induce immunological tolerance in vitro. Tolerance to polymerized flagellin may however be induced in vitro, provided the spleen cells are exposed to fragment A in the presence of specific antibody for 6 hr. The results are discussed in the light of current theories of the mechanism of tolerance induction.	ANTIBODY-MEDIATED SUPPRESSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN VITRO II.

Certain antigens such as polymerized flagellin are capable of producing relatively normal antibody levels in thymectomized mice, whereas others, including heterologous erythrocytes require the presence of T cells in a helper capacity. The mechanism of thymus-independent antibody production was investigated by comparing the primary IgM responses of spleen cells from ATXBM, XBM, and normal mice to various physical forms of the flagellar antigens of Salmonella adelaide in vitro. No reduction in antibody-forming cell levels to polymerized flagellin over a wide dose range was observed in ATXBM cultures, although the same spleen cells did not respond to an optimal dose of sheep red cells. In contrast, when flagellar determinants were presented in a monomeric form or as flagellin-coated donkey red cells, a highly significant difference was observed between the antibody responses of spleen cells from ATXBM mice and XBM or normal controls. The results suggested that the requirement for T cells in antibody production is not a property of specific antigenic determinants, but depends on the mode of antigenic presentation. The validity of this conclusion was confirmed by using another antigenic determinant (DNP) coupled either to the thymus-independent carrier, POL, or to the thymus-dependent carrier, DRC. Spleen cells from XBM mice produced comparable AFC levels to both forms of DNP, but the results from ATXBM cultures showed a marked difference. The anti-DNP response to DNP-DRC was greatly reduced compared to controls, whereas that to DNP-POL was normal even after prolonged thoracic duct drainage of the ATXBM donors and pretreatment of their spleen cells with anti-θ-serum and complement. The data presented here imply that the role of T cells in humoral immunity is the presentation of antigen to B cells in such a manner as to initiate optimal antibody synthesis.

The effects of hyperimmune anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRBC) antibody on the plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to SRBC by mouse spleen cells in vitro were studied. Anti-SRBC antibody specifically suppressed the PFC response against SRBC. The degree of suppression was directly related to the amount of antibody added and was overcome by large amounts of antigen. Suppressive activity was absorbed from the sera by SRBC and could be partially eluted from the antigen by heat. The PFC response in cultures stimulated with antigen-antibody complexes prepared with high concentrations of antibody were suppressed; however, some complexes prepared at lower antibody concentrations stimulated greater responses than SRBC alone. Antibodies collected after four immunizations had greater suppressive ability than those collected after two immunizations. The degree of suppression was as great whether antibody was added at the initiation of the cultures or 24 hr later, suggesting that during the first 24 hr the culture system was antigen-dependent. Incubation of separated lymphoid cells with antibody did not impair their ability to develop a PFC response in vitro. However, if macrophages were incubated with antibody either before or after incubation with SRBC, the subsequent PFC response by lymphoid cells was suppressed. The data are consistent with the conclusion that antibody suppresses the PFC response in vitro by neutralizing the antigenic stimulus at the macrophage-dependent phase of the response.

Tissue culture techniques were combined with cell separation procedures to investigate the cellular requirements for a response to antigen, leading to the production of antibody-forming cells. Mouse spleen was dissociated, and the cells were separated into various groups on the basis of density, size, and active adherence. The ability of fractions to initiate a response in vivo, on transfer to an irradiated recipient, was compared to the response in vitro; and this ability was correlated with the presence or absence of phagocytic cells. Two different antigens were studied, sheep erythrocytes (SRC) and polymerized bacterial flagellin (POL). Density distribution analysis of spleen showed a wide density range of cells responding to both antigens in vivo. The same fractions responded to POL in vitro as in vivo. By contrast, only the light density regions responded in vitro to SRC. Response occurred in regions of overlap between lymphocytes and phagocytic macrophages. Separation by active adherence on columns of large glass beads gave a preparation containing large, medium, and small lymphocytes but no detectable phagocytic macrophages and very low levels of phagocytic polymorphs. This lymphocyte preparation responded to both antigens in vivo. In vitro it gave a full response to POL, but no response to SRC. Addition of a small quantity of the adherent fraction, enriched for phagocytic cells, restored response to SRC. The use of strain-specific antisera in a mixed culture containing a C57 phagocytic fraction and CBA lymphocytes showed that the lymphocyte fraction contributed the precursors of the final antibody-forming cells. The accessory cells from C57 spleen banded in the light regions of the density gradient where phagocytic macrophages were found. Irradiated spleen cells also activated the lymphocyte preparation, suggesting that the irradiated host provided the accessory cells for the in vivo response to SRC. Small lymphocytes were purified from spleen by the small glass bead size filtration technique. This sample of small lymphocytes responded less well to POL than the total lymphocyte population, but it responded as well in vitro as in vivo. The small lymphocyte preparation responded in vivo to SRC but not in vitro. Addition of a small quantity of the phagocyte-rich fraction from adherence columns restored the in vitro response to SRC. The results indicated that phagocytic cells are not required in the initiation of an immune response to POL. By contrast some accessory cell, possibly a phagocytic macrophage, is required for a response to SRC. The basis for this marked difference is discussed.

The breaking of tolerance against the lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 055:B5 was studied. It was found that immune responsiveness recovered very slowly in vivo, tolerance still existing 3 wk after the last tolerizing injection. However, if spleen cells from tolerant mice were transferred into irradiated syngeneic recipients, the tolerant state was readily broken. Spleen cells transferred 3 days after the last tolerance-maintaining dose did not respond, whereas cells transferred on day 5 or 7 responded equally well as normal spleen cells. It was also possible to break tolerance by incubating tolerant spleen cells, which did not respond after transfer, for 20 hr in vitro before transfer into irradiated recipients. The results suggest that there exist reversibly inactivated cells in tolerant animals and that these cells can be reactivated upon removal of the cells to a neutral environment.

Randomized trials have demonstrated that mammographic screening can reduce breast cancer mortality. Our aim was to estimate the reduction in mortality expected from the East Anglian breast screening programme. Breast screening achieves benefit by improving cancer prognosis (reducing tumour size, nodal involvement and possibly grade) through earlier diagnosis. We compared cancer prognosis between women invited for screening and those not yet invited in East Anglia, UK, in order to predict the mortality reduction achievable by screening, independently of any reduction due to changes in treatment and underlying disease. Participants (both invited and not-yet invited) were women eligible for invitation to first and second screens and diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 1989–96. Death rates were predicted based on the observed distribution of tumour grade, size and node status amongst 950 cancers diagnosed following first invitation, up to and including at second screen (excluding those detected at first screening), and 451 cancers presenting symptomatically in women awaiting first invitation during the staggered introduction of screening, after adjustment for lead time amongst screen detected cases. For all ages, the ratio of predicted breast cancer mortality in the invited compared with the uninvited group was 0.85 (95% CI 0.78, 0.93). It was 0.93 (0.80, 1.08) for women aged 50–54 at diagnosis and 0.81 (0.72, 0.91) for those aged 55–64. We conclude that, by 2004, the second round of screening in East Anglia should reduce mortality by around 7% in women below age 55 at diagnosis, and by around 19% in those aged 55–64. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com	Predicted long-term mortality reduction associated with the second round of breast screening in East Anglia	J McCann, S Duffy, N Day	11161411	2001-02-01	7

Effect of screening and other factors on mortality estimated by comparing three year moving averages of observed mortality with those predicted (by five year age groups from 50-54 to 75-79), the effect of screening being restricted to certain age groups.SettingEngland and Wales.SubjectsWomen aged 40 to 79 years.ResultsCompared with predicted mortality in the absence of screening or other effects the total reduction in mortality from breast cancer in 1998 in women aged 55-69 was estimated as 21.3%. Direct effect of screening was estimated as 6.4% (range of estimates from 5.4-11.8%). Effect of all other factors (improved treatment with tamoxifen and chemotherapy, and earlier presentation outside the screening programme) was estimated as 14.9% (range 12.2-14.9%).ConclusionsBy 1998 both screening and other factors, including improvements in treatment, had resulted in substantial reductions in mortality from breast cancer. Many deaths in the 1990s will be of women diagnosed in the 1980s and early 1990s, before invitation to screening. Further major effects from screening and treatment are expected, which together with cohort effects should result in further substantial reductions in mortality from breast cancer, particularly for women aged 55-69, over the next 10 years.

OBJECTIVE--To assess the impact of the NHS breast screening programme on the incidence of and mortality from breast cancer. DESIGN--Comparison of age specific incidence and mortality before and after the introduction of screening in the late 1980s. SETTING--England and Wales. SUBJECTS--Women aged over 30 years. RESULTS--In 1992 the age standardised incidence of breast cancer was 40% higher than in 1979. After the introduction of screening in 1988 recorded incidence rates rose steeply in the screened age group (50-64 year olds) but not in others. In 1992 the rates levelled off at about 25% higher than in 1987. Total mortality from breast cancer has increased steadily since the 1950s; the rates increased earlier in the younger age groups. By the mid-1980s rates had begun to fall in the younger age groups; but total mortality was still among the highest in the world. Age standardised mortality in the 55-69 age group changed little during the first three years of screening but then fell steeply and in 1994 was 12% lower than in 1987. CONCLUSIONS--Since the introduction of screening there have been pronounced increases in recorded incidence in the screened age group. Cancer registries have an essential role in assessing screening programmes and cancer services. The steep decrease in mortality in 55-69 year olds which began three years after screening started is unlikely to be due to screening. The widespread adoption of treatment with tamoxifen during this period may be important. With the reduction in mortality already observed and the expected additional benefits from screening, the Health of the Nation target should be achieved.

OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between socioeconomic deprivation and pathological prognostic factors in women with breast cancer as a possible explanation for socioeconomic differences in survival. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of data from cancer registry and from pathology and biochemistry records. SETTING--Catchment areas of two large teaching hospitals in Glasgow. SUBJECTS--1361 women aged under 75 who had breast cancer diagnosed between 1980 and 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Tumour size, axillary lymph node status, histological grade, and oestrogen receptor concentration in relation to deprivation category of area of residence. RESULTS--There was no significant relation between socioeconomic deprivation and four pathological prognostic factors: 93 (32%) women in the most affluent group presented with tumours less than 20 mm in size compared with 91 (31%) women in the most deprived group; 152 (48%) of the most affluent group presented with negative nodes compared with 129 (46%) of the most deprived group; 23 (22%) of the most affluent group presented with grade I tumours compared with 12 (17%) of the most deprived group; and 142 (51%) of the most affluent group had a low oestrogen receptor concentration at presentation compared with 148 (52%) of the most deprived group. None of these differences was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS--Differences in survival from breast cancer by socioeconomic deprivation category could not be accounted for by differences in tumour stage or biology. Other possible explanations, such as differences in treatment or in host response, should be investigated.

Reproductive-related factors play a major role in the aetiology of cancers of the breast, ovary and endometrium. Pregnancy history influences the risk of each of these cancers, and oral contraceptive use modifies the risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers, although its effect on breast cancer risk is less certain. We analysed recent time trends in the incidence and mortality of these cancers in England and Wales and assessed whether they can be explained by changes in fertility and oral contraceptive use. During 1962-87, there were significant increases in the overall incidence of breast cancer (0.95% increase per annum) and ovarian cancer (0.76% per annum) but little increase in endometrial cancer (0.13% per annum). At young ages incidence of each of the cancers has declined in recent years, whereas at older ages there have been substantial increases. Mortality data show similar time trends. In analyses by birth cohort, incidence of each of the cancers increased steeply for successive cohorts born before the turn of the century, and more slowly for cohorts thereafter, reaching a maximum for those born in the 1920s, and decreased for those born subsequently. The increases in incidence for women born before the turn of the century paralleled marked declines in their fertility. The fall in risk for women born after the 1920s was not accompanied by significant increases in their fertility, but coincided with the introduction and increase in use of oral contraceptives. For ovarian and endometrial cancers this accords with strong evidence from person-based studies of the protective effect of oral contraceptives. For breast cancer, the reasons for the recent decline are not clear. It would accord with recent suggestions of a long-term protective effect of oral contraceptives, on which further studies are needed. It is also possible, however, that changes in other risk factors such as dietary fat intake and menarcheal age might have contributed to the recent declines in the risk of these cancers.

We studied the association between deprivation and survival from breast cancer in 29,676 women aged 30 and over who were diagnosed during the period 1980-89 in the area covered by the South Thames Regional Health Authority. The measure of deprivation was the Carstairs Index of the census enumeration district of each woman's residence at diagnosis. We studied the impact of stage at diagnosis, morphology and type of treatment on this association, with the relative survival rate and the hazard ratio as measures of outcome. There was a clear gradient in survival, with better survival for women from more affluent areas. At all ages, women in the most deprived category had a 35% greater hazard of death than women from the most affluent areas after adjustment for stage at diagnosis, morphological type and type of treatment. In younger women (30-64 years), the survival gradient by deprivation category cannot be explained by these prognostic factors. In older women (65-99 years), part of the unadjusted gradient in survival can be explained by differences in the stage of disease: older women in the most deprived category were more often diagnosed with advanced disease. Other factors, so far unidentified, are responsible for the gradient in breast cancer survival by deprivation category. The potential effect on breast cancer mortality of eliminating the gradient in survival by deprivation category is substantial (7.4%). In women aged 30-64 years, 10% of all deaths within 5 years might be avoidable, while in older women this figure is 5.8%.	Deprivation and survival from breast cancer.	C. T. Schrijvers, J. P.

Statistics from the Swedish National Cancer Registry based on all 110,658 cases of invasive breast cancer during the 31-year period 1958-1988 were analysed. Age-specific incidence rates increased over successive calendar periods. The average annual increase in the age-standardised incidence rate was 1.3%, with the greatest percentage changes among the youngest age groups. During the latter half of the study period, the rates of increase tended to diminish in the youngest age groups and even reversed significantly among women from 75 years of age. In analyses using age-period-cohort models, the best fit of the cancer incidence data was found for the full model which simultaneously considered the effects of age, period and cohort. Cohort effects were found to be more important than period effects, in terms of model fit. These effects emerged as a seemingly consistent, and in a logarithmic scale, fairly linear increase in the relative risk of breast cancer incidence with a 3-fold elevation in women born in the 1950's relative to those born in the 1880's. It is concluded that the rising breast cancer incidence in Sweden is explained chiefly by birth cohort effects, which indicate persistent secular changes in largely unknown risk factors associated with life style. We could not in the present data see any clear evidence for an adverse effect of contraceptive or replacement sex steroids on breast cancer incidence.

Hereditary breast cancer shows a distinctive natural history characterised by an earlier age of onset, excess bilaterality, vertical transmission, heterogeneous tumour associations, and improved survival when compared to its sporadic counterpart. To date, very little attention has been given to interrelationships between breast cancer risk factors and genetics. In the general population, early age of first term pregnancy has been generally accepted as protective against breast cancer. In addition, recent findings suggest that an early age of first pregnancy may be associated with an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis. We studied the age at first pregnancy and age at onset of breast cancer among 162 females at 50% genetic risk, 72 of whom had already developed the disease. We then compared them to 154 consecutively ascertained breast cancer patients from the Creighton Cancer Center. In the hereditary subset (1) early first term pregnancy did not alter the frequency of breast cancer; (2) early age at first term pregnancy was not associated with an earlier age at cancer diagnosis; and (3) age of breast cancer onset in nulliparous females was not significantly lower than that in females having at least one term pregnancy. We speculate, therefore, that in our hereditary population, pregnancy does not influence the natural history of breast cancer in the same way that it does in the population at large.

Segregation analysis of breast cancer in families can provide the logical basis and the specific genetic models for mapping and identifying genes responsible for human breast cancer. Patterns of breast cancer occurrence in families were investigated by complex segregation analysis. In a sample of 1579 nuclear families ascertained through a population-based series of probands, an autosomal dominant model with a highly penetrant susceptibility allele fully explained disease clustering. From the maximum-likelihood Mendelian model, the frequency of the susceptibility allele was 0.0006 in the general population, and lifetime risk of breast cancer was 0.82 among susceptible women and 0.08 among women without the susceptibility allele. Inherited susceptibility affected only 4% of families in the sample: multiple cases of this relatively common disease occurred in other families by chance. The same genetic models, with higher gene frequency, explained disease clustering in an extended kindred at high risk of breast cancer. Evidence for a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant susceptibility allele for breast cancer in a high-risk family and the general population suggests that high-risk families can serve as models for understanding breast cancer in the population as a whole.

A subject from a family with ovarian cancer who has developed bilateral medullary carcinoma of the breast at the age of 40 is presented. The family is consistent with dominant inheritance of ovarian cancer and 12 female family members at 12.5%, 25%, and 50% risk, including our case, have undergone bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy and been given hormone replacement therapy. Despite the risk of further primary tumours of the breast our patient chose to have treatment with wide excision and radiotherapy. The implications for screening, prophylaxis, and hormone replacement therapy for this family are discussed.	Ovarian cancer family and prophylactic choices.

We present the findings of a pilot study to assess the perception of risk in 155 women with a family history of breast cancer by questionnaire. Only 11% of women were able to identify the correct population risk and more than half were unable to assess their own lifetime risk within 50% of the clinicians' estimate. Although it is probable that women are helped by genetic counselling and if at substantial risk, annual mammography, the psychological impact of assigning true risk and the value of mammography need to be evaluated.

Breast cancer is known to have an inherited component, consistent in some families with autosomal dominant inheritance; in such families the disease often occurs in association with ovarian cancer. Previous genetic linkage studies have established that in some such families disease occurrence is linked to markers on chromosome 17q. This paper reports the results of a collaborative linkage study involving 214 breast cancer families, including 57 breast-ovarian cancer families; this represents almost all the known families with 17q linkage data. Six markers on 17q, spanning approximately 30 cM, were typed in the families. The aims of the study were to define more precisely the localization of the disease gene, the extent of genetic heterogeneity and the characteristics of linked families and to estimate the penetrance of the 17q gene. Under the assumption of no genetic heterogeneity, the strongest linkage evidence was obtained with D17S588 (maximum LOD score [Zmax] = 21.68 at female recombination fraction [theta f] = .13) and D17S579 (Zmax = 13.02 at theta f = .16). Multipoint linkage analysis allowing for genetic heterogeneity provided evidence that the predisposing gene lies between the markers D17S588 and D17S250, an interval whose genetic length is estimated to be 8.3 cM in males and 18.0 cM in females. This position was supported over other intervals by odds of 66:1. The location of the gene with respect to D17S579 could not be determined unequivocally. Under the genetic model used in the analysis, the best estimate of the proportion of linked breast-ovarian cancer families was 1.0 (lower LOD-1 limit 0.79). In contrast, there was significant evidence of genetic heterogeneity among the families without ovarian cancer, with an estimated 45% being linked. These results suggest that a gene(s) on chromosome 17q accounts for the majority of families in which both early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer occur but that other genes predisposing to breast cancer exist. By examining the fit of the linkage data to different penetrance functions, the cumulative risk associated with the 17q gene was estimated to be 59% by age 50 years and 82% by age 70 years. The corresponding estimates for the breast-ovary families were 67% and 76%, and those for the families without ovarian cancer were 49% and 90%; these penetrance functions did not differ significantly from one another.

A study of 98,000 cases in the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1961 to 1979 was undertaken. The relative survival by social class was calculated. There was a higher survival probability for white collar workers than for blue collar workers or self-employed farmers for all cancer, as well as for particular cancers, such as, for instance, cancer of the breast and cervix among women and cancer of the rectum among men. For lung cancer, cancer of the stomach, and pancreatic cancer there were no detectable differences in survival probability. The findings can be considered in the light of various possible explanations, for instance, early detection, differential treatment, and host factors.	Cancer survival and social class in Sweden.

STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer survival. DESIGN--This was a prospective study, linking census and vital registration records for an approximate 1% representative sample of those enumerated in England and Wales in the 1971 census. SETTING--The study population is nationwide. PARTICIPANTS--The study sample consists of 250,588 men and 262,484 women. During 1971-81, 17,844 cases of cancer were registered, and of those registered, 13,532 died during 1971-1983. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Socioeconomic status was assessed in terms of housing tenure. Council tenants, the low socioeconomic group, had poorer survival than owner occupiers, the high socioeconomic group, for the combined group of all neoplasms, and for 11 out of 13 neoplasms examined in males, and 12 out of 15 neoplasms examined in females. Differences were found irrespective of age, cause of death and prognosis of the cancer. Survival analysis by length of follow up indicated that council tenants were more likely to present at a later stage than owner occupiers. CONCLUSIONS--Wide survival differentials were observed between socioeconomic groups. Differences in survival for cancers of poor prognosis (eg, oesophagus, pancreas, lung) where treatment has little effect, cannot be attributed to socioeconomic differences in treatment. The survival differences for cancers of good prognosis (eg, corpus uteri, bladder, skin) could, in part, be due to differences in treatment. It is probable that delay in seeking care is one of the major contributing causes.	Socioeconomic differences in cancer survival.	M Kogevinas, M G Marmot, A J Fox, P O Goldblatt	1757764	1991-09-01	7	
An international collaborative study of breast cancer and reproductive experience has been carried out in 7 areas of the world. In all areas studied, a striking relation between age at first birth and breast cancer risk was observed. It is estimated that women having their first child when aged under 18 years have only about one-third the breast cancer risk of those whose first birth is delayed until the age of 35 years or more. Births after the first, even if they occur at an early age, have no, or very little, protective effect. The reduced risk of breast cancer in women having their first child at an early age explains the previously observed inverse relationship between total parity and breast cancer risk, since women having their first birth early tend to become ultimately of high parity. The association with age at first birth requires different kinds of etiological hypotheses from those that have been invoked in the past to explain the association between breast cancer risk and reproductive experience.

The national Swedish cancer registry was used to analyse the age-specific time trends in breast cancer incidence in Sweden from 1970 to 1984. The analysis included both a calendar year and a birth cohort approach to estimate time trends in disease occurrence. According to the birth cohort approach there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence with an average annual increase of the incidence of 3.2% (P = 0.0114), 3.4% (P = 0.0002) and 2.2% (P = 0.0264) in the age groups 25-29, 30-34 and 35-39, respectively.

A population-based case-control study was conducted in Sweden and Norway to analyse possible associations between breast cancer occurring before the age of 45 and several different characteristics of the women's reproductive life. A total of 422 (89.2%) of all eligible patients, and 527 (80.6%) of all eligible controls were interviewed. In univariate analyses, different characteristics of child-bearing (parity, age at first birth, years between last birth and diagnosis, duration of breast-feeding, and number of induced and spontaneous abortions), measures of the fertile or ovulating period (age at menarche, years between menarche and first pregnancy, and estimates of the menstruation span) and symptoms of anovulatory cycles or infertility were all seemingly unrelated to, or at most weakly associated with breast cancer. Adjustment for possible confounding factors in multivariate analyses resulted in largely unaltered risk estimates with odds ratios close to unity and without any significant trends when the exposure variables were studied in categorised or in continuous form. We conclude that reproductive factors did not explain the occurrence of breast cancer before the age of 45 in this population.

We have carried out a case-control study to examine the relationship between mammographic signs and breast cancer. The mammographic signs assessed were prominent ducts and dysplasia. The cases were a group of 183 women with histologically verified unilateral breast cancer. The controls were a group of women attending a screening centre. Cases and controls were individually age-matched. Mammograms from the non-cancerous breast of the cases were randomly assembled with those of the controls and classified by 3 radiologists without knowledge of which films were from cases and which from controls. Mammographic dysplasia was found to be strongly associated with breast cancer, particularly in women aged less than 50. Prominent ducts were only weakly associated with breast cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that the association between dysplasia and breast cancer could not be explained on the basis of other risk factors for breast cancer, and that classification of dysplasia discriminated more strongly between cases and controls than did classification of Wolfe's mammographic patterns. These results show that mammograms contain information about risk of breast cancer. Mammographic dysplasia is strongly associated with breast cancer, is present in a substantial proportion of patients with the disease, and may offer opportunities for prevention.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that mammographic dysplasia is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in premenopausal women. To examine biochemical associations with mammographic dysplasia we have compared premenopausal women with different patterns of the breast parenchyma on mammography. One group had extensive radiological dysplasia (n = 30) and the other no dysplasia (n = 16). Both groups were recruited from mammographic units in the same way and then compared according to epidemiological risk factors, anthropometric measures, nutrient intake and plasma levels of oestradiol, progesterone and prolactin obtained in both follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as total plasma cholesterol and lipid fractions. Women with mammographic dysplasia were found to be leaner, more often nulliparous and to consume more alcohol than women without these radiological changes. Mammographic dysplasia and a family history of breast cancer were found to be independently associated with significantly higher levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after taking into account the possible confounding effects of percentage body fat, parity and consumption of alcohol and dietary fat. Triglyceride levels were also independently associated with a family history of breast cancer. We conclude that further investigation is warranted of the role of plasma lipids in relation to breast cancer risk.	Plasma lipids in premenopausal women with mammographic dysplasia.	N. F. Boyd, V.

Epidemiological studies have shown that early first pregnancy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer, which indicates that initiation of the disease occurs at an early age. Thus the subclinical lesion of breast cancer might already be present in the breast before childbearing begins and the growth of any such focus might be modified by the endocrine changes of pregnancy. To test this hypothesis the relation between parity and age at presentation was studied in 341 unselected patients with breast cancer presenting to a single clinic. The mean age at presentation was 5.2 years lower in parous than nulliparous women (p < 0.001) and fell with increasing parity. It is concluded that reproductive history influences not only the risk of breast cancer but also the latent interval of a proportion of breast carcinomas.ImagesFIG 1FIG 2	Parity and breast cancer: evidence of a dual effect.

We analysed data from a case-control investigation conducted in Milan, Northern Italy, to evaluate the relation between the use of combination oral contraceptives and the risk of cancers of the breast, ovary, endometrium and cervix uteri. For the present analysis, 776 cases of histologically confirmed breast cancer, 406 of epithelial ovarian cancer and 170 of endometrial cancer aged under 60 were compared with a group of 1,282 subjects below age 60 admitted for a spectrum of acute conditions apparently unrelated to oral contraceptive use or to any of the known or potential risk factors for the diseases under study. Likewise, 225 cases of invasive cervical cancer were compared with 225 age-matched inpatient controls, and 202 cases of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia with 202 outpatient controls identified in the same screening clinics. The age-adjusted relative risk estimates for ever vs. never use of combination oral contraceptives were 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.37) for breast cancer, 0.68 (95% CI = 0.48-0.97) for epithelial ovarian cancer, 0.50 (95% CI = 0.23-1.12) for endometrial cancer, 1.49 (95% CI = 0.88-2.55) for cervical cancer and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.50-1.18) for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. The risk of ovarian cancer decreased and that of invasive cervical cancer increased with longer duration of use. Neither duration of oral contraceptive use nor time since first or last use significantly altered a user's risk of other neoplasms considered. Likewise, analysis of sub-groups of age, parity or other potentially important covariates did not show any important interaction, and allowance for them by means of logistic regression did not materially modify any of the results. These data confirm that combination oral contraceptives confer some protection against ovarian and endometrial cancers but may increase the risk of invasive cervical cancer if used for several years, and indicate that the past or current pattern of oral contraceptive use in Italy is unlikely materially to affect the risk of breast cancer.

We are reporting a male patient who suffered from chronic granulomatous disease associated with cytochrome b−245 deficiency and McLeod red cell phenotype, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa. On cytogenetic analysis, he seemed to have a very subtle interstitial deletion of part of band Xp21. Since it was impossible to know whether this material was truly deleted or inserted elsewhere in the genome, somatic cell and molecular studies were carried out. In somatic cell hybrids, the deleted X chromosome was isolated on a Chinese hamster background. Southern blot analysis with 20 single-copy probes, that had been mapped to the X short arm, led to the discovery of one (probe 754) that is missing from this patient's X chromosome and also from his total DNA. This proves that he, indeed, has a deletion rather than a balanced insertion. The results provide cytological mapping information for the X-linked phenotypes present in this patient. Furthermore, probe 754 recognizes a restriction fragment length polymorphism of high frequency that makes it the most powerful probe currently available for linkage studies with X-linked muscular dystrophy.ImagesFig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 4Fig. 5	Minor Xp21 chromosome deletion in a male associated with expression of duchenne muscular dystrophy, chronic granulomatous disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and McLeod syndrome	Uta Francke, Hans D.

"During 1968-1980, 1176 women aged 16-50 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer and a like number of matched controls were interviewed at 9 teaching hospitals in London and Oxford and asked about their use of oral contraceptives. The results were reassuring. A few statistically significant differences in oral contraceptive use were found between the breast cancer and control groups, but the data were subdivided in many ways so that some ""significant"" differences would have been expected through the play of chance alone. Certainly no patterns of risk emerged which would suggest that any of the associations were causal. It must be stressed, however, that the data are still sparse in some important subcategories--for example, only small numbers of both cases and controls had prolonged oral contraceptive use before their first term pregnancy. For this reason, it is important that information on the possible relationship between pill use and breast cancer should continue to be collected. Women who had never used oral contraceptives presented with appreciably more advanced tumours than those who had been using oral contraceptives during the year before detection of cancer, while past users were in an intermediate position. These differences in staging were reflected in the pattern of survival. Possible explanations for these observations include ""surveillance bias"" among oral contraceptive users leading to earlier diagnosis and a beneficial biological effect of oral contraceptives on tumour growth and spread. Women with breast cancer reported never having used any method of contraception and heavy cigarette smoking (greater than or equal to 15 per day) significantly less often than controls. We could find no obvious explanation for the former observation, but suspect that the latter reflects the unrepresentative smoking habits of our hospital controls rather than a protective effect of smoking against breast cancer."

The relationship between breast self examination (BSE) and breast cancer stage at diagnosis was examined in 616 women aged 15-59 years. Differences in tumour characteristics between those not practising BSE and those practising but not taught were small and inconstant. However, women who had both practised and had been taught BSE had more favourable tumours than the non-practising group. The difference was most marked in terms of tumour size and the involvement of axillary nodes. The proportions of women in the non-BSE and taught-BSE groups with each characteristic were respectively: size less than or equal to 2 cm 33% and 45%, T1 clinical stage 27% and 42%, and N0 pathological stage 37% and 50%. This advantage to taught-BSE women persisted after adjustment for the identified confounding factors of age, social class and oral contraceptive use. The likely impact on breast cancer mortality is difficult to assess, although the potential benefit of the lead time gained must not be ignored when assessing the costs and benefits of BSE.

Many cancers and other chronic diseases are associated with a long delay between exposure to a putative risk factor and subsequent diagnosis. This presents well recognised problems in the elucidation of suspected risk factors by epidemiological methods. In this paper we discuss the interpretation in epidemiological studies of the effect of a possible risk factor when population exposure is recent and rapidly changing. An important contemporary example concerns the study of early oral contraceptive (OC) use in relation to the subsequent risk of breast cancer. Computer simulations reported here indicate that plausible delays in the manifestation of any effect on breast cancer incidence make it difficult to exclude early OC use as a risk factor for breast cancer, even when large well conducted epidemiological studies show no apparent increased risk. Methods for detecting a 'latent' effect are discussed.	Early oral contraceptive use and breast cancer: theoretical effects of latency.	K McPherson, P A Coope, M P Vessey	3655620	1986-12-01	7	
We report the results of a case-control study of oral contraceptive use and breast cancer conducted in London, Oxford and Edinburgh between 1980 and 1984. One thousand one hundred and twenty-five women aged 16-64 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer and a like number of matched controls were interviewed and asked about their past due use of oral contraceptives (OCs). Among women aged 45 years or more at diagnosis there was no evidence of an association between OC use and breast cancer. Among the 351 pairs of women aged under 45 years at diagnosis there was a significantly elevated risk associated with increasing duration of use before first full term pregnancy (relative risk for 4+ years use versus never use = 2.6, 95% confidence limits, 1.3-5.4). Since this result is at variance with the findings in some other studies we have investigated the nature of this association with particular emphasis on possible bias, pill type and a latent effect.

During the interval 1968-74, 17,032 women aged 25-39 years were recruited to the Oxford-Family Planning Association contraceptive study, more than half of whom were using oral contraceptives. These women have been followed up over the years and breast cancer has been diagnosed in 189 of them. We have analysed the available data in two ways. First, we have calculated standardised breast cancer incidence rates in non-users and users of oral contraceptives according to total duration of use, interval since first use, interval since last use, duration of use before first term pregnancy and duration of use before age 25. Secondly, we have conducted case-control within cohort analyses to examine the possible effects of different types of pill and to search for evidence of a latent effect of oral contraceptive use before first term pregnancy on breast cancer risk. We have found no evidence of any adverse effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of breast cancer in this study. There was, however, little exposure to the pill before first term pregnancy among the participants and virtually no such exposure at a very young age (i.e. below 20 years). Accordingly, the results of this study strengthen the evidence that oral contraceptive use by mature women does not increase breast cancer risk, but add little to the uncertainty about the effects of early use.

A population-based case-control study of oral contraceptive use and breast cancer was carried out among young women (less than 43 years of age) at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle, Washington. Use of oral contraceptives before first pregnancy did not materially differ between cases or controls. The rate ratio estimate of breast cancer incidence in women who had used oral contraceptives before first pregnancy compared to those who had not was 0.9 (95% CI = 0.4, 2.1). There were no meaningful patterns of association between breast cancer and duration of use or formulation of oral contraceptive used before first pregnancy.	Oral contraceptives and breast cancer.	S.

A case-control study was conducted in Los Angeles County, California, of 163 very young breast-cancer cases (all aged 32 or less at diagnosis) to investigate the role, if any, of oral contraceptives (OC) in the development of the disease. OC use before first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) was associated with an elevated risk, which increased with duration of OC use (relative risk approximately 2.2 at 6 years of use, P < 0.01). This increased risk could not be explained by other risk factors. OC use after FFTP was not associated with any change in risk. A first-trimester abortion before FFTP, whether spontaneous or induced, was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in breast-cancer risk (P < 0.005).

A recent publication from California in this journal has suggested that both prolonged oral contraceptive use and abortion before first term pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer in young women. Data are presented on 1176 women aged 16-50 years with breast cancer, interviewed in London or in Oxford, together with a like number of matches control subjects. The results are entirely reassuring, being, in fact, more compatible with protective effects than the reverse. Possible reasons for the differences between the 2 sets of data are discussed.

In a population based case-control study 433 New Zealand women aged 25-54 with newly diagnosed breast cancer were compared with 897 women selected at random from the electoral rolls. The relative risk of breast cancer in women who had ever used oral contraceptives was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.25). The relative risk in women aged 25-34 at diagnosis was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 9.9) and in older women less than 1. Analyses of risk by duration of use of oral contraceptives, age at first use, and time since first use showed no adverse effect of the pill. In particular, there was no increased risk in women who had used oral contraceptives before the age of 25 or before their first pregnancy, even for prolonged periods. Given the high prevalence of use in New Zealand, this study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that use of oral contraceptives at young ages increases the risk of breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE--To assess whether changes in the intraovarian vasculature or blood flow impedance can be used to identify potentially malignant masses. DESIGN--Open, non-comparative prospective study. SETTING--Ovarian screening clinics at King's College Hospital and the Hallam Medical Centre. SUBJECTS--50 Women selected on the basis of their medical history and the result of a previous transvaginal ultrasound scan. Thirty women (10 premenopausal (scan taken on days 1 to 8 of the menstrual cycle) and 20 postmenopausal) had normal ovaries, and 20 had at least one ovary with an abnormal morphology or volume, or both. INTERVENTIONS--Women with a positive result on screening were referred for laparotomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of coloured areas (neovascularisation) and the pulsatility index within each ovary. The pulsatility index is a measure of the impedance to blood flow, a low value indicating decreased impedance and a high value increased impedance to blood flow. RESULTS--Two women with a positive result on screening had hydrosalpinges, 10 a benign tumour or a tumour-like condition, and eight primary ovarian cancers. No areas of neovascularisation were seen in the 30 women with morphologically normal ovaries and the two patients with hydrosalpinges; the pulsatility index ranged from 3.1 to 9.4. Similarly, nine patients (10 affected ovaries) with a non-malignant mass had no signs of neovascularisation and the pulsatility index varied from 3.2 to 7.0. One patient with bilateral dermoid cysts containing nests of thyroid-like cells had vascular changes and pulsatility index values of 0.4 and 0.8. Seven patients (eight ovaries) with primary ovarian cancer (one stage IV, four stage II, and two stage Ia) showed clear evidence of neovascularisation and pulsatility index values were from 0.3 to 1.0. One patient with an intraepithelial serous cystadenocarcinoma in a small ovary (less than 5 ml volume) had no signs of any vascular change and the pulsatility index was 5.5. CONCLUSION--Transvaginal colour flow imaging may be used to identify potentially malignant ovarian masses and help elucidate the early stages of tumorigenesis. The routine application of this technique may reduce the rate of false positive results of an ultrasonography based screening procedure.ImagesFIG 1FIG 2	Transvaginal colour flow imaging: a possible new screening technique for ovarian cancer.

OBJECTIVE--To assess the value of ultrasonography in a screening procedure for early ovarian cancer. DESIGN--Prospective study of at least 5000 self referred women without symptoms of ovarian cancer. Each woman was scheduled to undergo three annual screenings (consisting of one or more scans) to detect grossly abnormal ovaries or non-regressing masses. SETTING--The ovarian screening clinic at King's College Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--5479 Self referred women without symptoms (aged 18-78, mean age 52). INTERVENTIONS--Women with a positive result on screening were referred for laparoscopy or laparotomy, or both. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings at surgery and from histology of abnormal ovaries. RESULTS--A total of 14,594 screenings (15,977 scans) were performed. A positive result was obtained at 338 screens (2.3%) comprising 326 subjects (5.9%). Five patients with primary ovarian cancer (four stage Ia, one stage Ib; two at first screening three at second) were identified (prevalence 0.09%). An additional four patients had metastatic ovarian cancer (three at first screening, one at second). The apparent detection rate was 100%. It was not possible to differentiate between the ultrasonic appearance of early malignant and benign tumours. The rate of false positive results for primary ovarian cancer was 3.5% at the first screening, 1.8% at the second, and 1.2% at the third. Overall the rate of false positive results was 2.3%; the specificity was 97.7% and the predictive value of a positive result on screening was 1.5%. The odds that a positive result on screening indicated the presence of an ovarian tumour, any ovarian cancer, or primary ovarian cancer were about one to two, one to 37, and one to 67 respectively. CONCLUSION--Ultrasonography can be used to screen women without symptoms for persistent ovarian masses that will include early ovarian cancer.

In order to pinpoint the locale of the gene for early-onset familial breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1), polymorphisms were developed within the locus for thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA1) and for several anonymous sequences at chromosome 17q12-q21. The THRA1 polymorphism is a dinucleotide repeat with 10 alleles and heterozygosity.79. Gene mapping in extended families with inherited, early-onset breast and ovarian cancer indicates that BRCA1 is distal to THRA1 and proximal to D17S183 (SCG43), an interval of < 4 cM. This locale excludes HER2, THRA1, WNT3, HOX2, NGFR, PHB, COLIA1, NME1, and NME2 as candidates for BRCA1 but does not exclude RARA or EDH17B. Resolving the remaining recombination events in these families by new polymorphisms in the THRA1-D17S183 interval will facilitate positional cloning of the breast-ovarian cancer gene on chromosome 17q12-q21.

"Seven families, selected for breast cancer segregation, have been analyzed for chromosome 17q12-q23 linkage to breast and ovarian cancer. In two of them, linkage is seen with most markers tested, increasing toward the most proximal region, but without informative recombinations above NM23. In the remaining families, no linkage is observed. Families with 17q linkage are not easily distinguished by clinical characteristics such as early onset (mean age at diagnosis < or = 45 years) or organs involved. In fact, the family with the highest lod scores (> or = 2.3) belongs to the ""later onset"" (> 45 years) category of families. Interestingly, prostatic cancer is the most frequent malignancy, after breast cancer, in the families that we studied (13 cases total, all metastasizing) and is especially prevalent in males presumed to carry the trait. Of 16 paternal carriers, 7 (44%) had developed prostatic cancer. Haplotype analysis in families with 17q linkage reveals two further prostatic cases as potential carriers. We propose that breast cancer genes may predispose to prostatic cancer in male carriers."

Nineteen North American Caucasian families that contain a minimum of four confirmed cases of breast or ovarian cancer have been studied. Four polymorphisms (cLB17.1, D17S579, D17S588, and D17S74), which span a region of approximately 15 cM on chromosome 17q12, were typed. Our data confirm the location of a dominant gene conferring susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (maximum lod = 9.78) and suggest that the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. Two recombinants in one large family suggest that the breast-ovarian cancer locus lies between D17S588 and D17S579.	A breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene maps to chromosome 17q21.

In this paper we present linkage results from the analysis of 18 Utah breast cancer kindreds, for three 17q markers. Four kindreds had LOD scores greater than 1.0 for at least one of the marker loci. One of these kindreds has a LOD score of 6.07 with D17S579, and we believe it to be the most informative 17q family reported to date. Among the kindreds which appear unlinked to 17q were an early-onset breast cancer family, a large breast-ovarian family, and a kindred with mixed age at onset. Analysis of individual recombinants in the linked families localizes the BRCA1 gene between THRA1 and D17S579 (Mfd188). A comparison of the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study (CASH) model and a model which assumes a rare dominant susceptibility locus with low penetrance and no phenocopies stresses the difficulties in assessing linkage if the assumptions of the CASH model in terms of age at onset of breast cancer are not appropriate for the BRCA1 locus. A hypothetical breast cancer pedigree is used to calculate gene carrier probabilities under the CASH model, thereby illustrating some of our concerns regarding the use of this model to detect and exclude 17q linkage in breast cancer families.

In a study of 31 breast cancer families and 12 breast-ovarian cancer families, we have obtained clear evidence of linkage to markers on chromosome 17q in the families with ovarian cancer (maximum lod score 3.34 at theta = .04) but only weak evidence in those without ovarian cancer.

We have conducted linkage analysis in 16 breast cancer families, 13 of which are classified as site-specific breast cancer families and 3 of which are classified as breast-ovary families. Linkage analysis has largely focused on a single extended breast-ovary family. Analysis of all families combined shows significant evidence for linkage to 17q (LOD = 3.63 at theta = .0, for linkage to NME1), confirming the observations of Hall et al. and Narod et al. Many families were consistent with linkage, but their limited size and informativeness precluded confirmation of linkage. A putative recombinant in a breast-ovary family suggests that BRCA1 is distal to D17S250.

Previous studies have demonstrated linkage between early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer and genetic markers on chromosome 17q21. These markers define the location of a gene (BRCA1) which appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant susceptibility allele. We analyzed five families with multiple affected individuals for evidence of linkage to the BRCA1 region. Two of the five families appear to be linked to BRCA1. One apparently linked family contains critical recombinants, suggesting that the gene is proximal to the marker D17S579 (Mfd188). These findings are consistent with the maximum-likelihood position estimated by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium and with recombination events detected in other linked families. Linkage analysis was greatly aided by PCR-based analysis of paraffin-embedded normal breast tissue from deceased family members, demonstrating the feasibility and importance of this approach. One of the two families with evidence of linkage between breast cancer and genetic markers flanking BRCA1 represents the first such family of African-American descent to be reported in detail.ImagesFigure 4	BRCA1 maps proximal to D17S579 on chromosome 17q21 by genetic analysis	Jeffrey S.

Linkage of early-onset familial breast and ovarian cancer to 11 markers on chromosome 17q12-q21 defines an 8-cM region which is very likely to include the disease gene BRCA 1. The most closely linked marker is D17S579, a highly informative CA repeat polymorphism. D17S579 has no recombinants with inherited breast or ovarian cancer in 79 informative meioses in the seven families with early-onset disease (lod score 9.12 at zero recombination). There is no evidence for linkage heterogeneity in the families with early-onset disease. The proportion of older-onset breast cancer attributable to BRCA 1 is not yet determinable, because both inherited and sporadic cases occur in older-onset families.

We describe a detailed somatic cell hybrid map of human chromosome 17q11.2-q23, containing the familial breast and ovarian cancer locus (BRCA1) and highly informative closely linked markers. An X-irradiation panel of 38 hamster/human and mouse/human hybrids with fragments of chromosome 17 was generated and characterized with 22 STS markers from this chromosome. A detailed map of 61 probes onto chromosome 17q, subdividing the chromosome arm into 25 regions, was done by using a panel of hybrids with well-defined breakpoints and nine chromosome-mediated gene transfectants. Our localization of RARA, TOP2, EDH17B1 and 2, and possibly WNT3, between THRA1 and D17S181, two markers known to flank BRCA1, suggests that any of these is a potential candidate for the BRCA1 locus. The marker D17S579 (Mfd188), which is believed to be very close to BRCA1, maps closest to the EDH17B genes.

The object of this study was to assess the relative risks of cancer for a particular branch of industry by using the newly created cancer environment registry. The registry was created by a record linkage of the 1960 census to the Swedish Cancer Registry 1961-73. A cohort study was undertaken of all subjects classified in the census as working in the electronics or electrical manufacturing industry. The risks were calculated in relation to the general working population. The results showed a slightly higher total incidence of cancer (all sites) in this branch of industry than in the general working population, for men as well as for women. This was especially so for tumour sites connected with the pharynx and the respiratory system. The study also indicates that the new registry has a potential as a screening instrument.

An international collaborative study has been carried out to test the hypothesis that prolonged lactation protects women against cancer of the breast. While pregnancy itself seemed to confer some protection against breast cancer in all areas studied, no consistent differences in duration of lactation were found between breast cancer patients and unaffected women, once the fact that breast cancer patients have fewer pregnancies had been allowed for. Even in areas where some women had lactated for a total of 5 years or more, such women occurred proportionately no less frequently among breast cancer patients than among unaffected women. In the light of this and other recent evidence, it is unlikely that lactation has any protective effect against breast cancer in women, and other explanations must be sought for the remarkable international differences in the frequency of this disease.

Epidemiological characteristics of breast cancer have been studied in Tokyo, an area of relatively low breast cancer rates, as part of an international collaborative study. Breast feeding of infants is customary for Japanese women, but even very prolonged lactation did not appear to be associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk. Late age at menarche and early age at first pregnancy were both associated with reduced breast cancer risk. The protective effect of early pregnancy seems much greater than has previously been recognized, and may indeed be greater in Japan than in other areas. However, the average age at first pregnancy is not lower in Tokyo than in areas than in areas where breast cancer rates are high.

Because there has been a recent trend toward delay of childbearing in the United States, women in the birth cohort of 1945-49 will have an estimated 5 per cent greater incidence of breast cancer, and those in the cohort of 1950-54 an estimated 9 per cent greater incidence compared with the cohort of 1935-39, which had the distribution of age at first birth most favorable for breast cancer risk.

An analysis of the occurrence of breast cancer in this long-term prospective cohort study shows a significant relative risk (RR) in women who have ever used oral contraceptives (OC) of 3.33 in women age 30 to 34 years at diagnosis and an RR of 5.88 (P = 0.0011) in women who were parity 1 at the time of diagnosis. In women below the age of 35 years the RR of 2.38 was not significant. There was no increased risk in women over the age of 35 years. A significant trend relating to duration of use was demonstrable in women who were parity 1 in the analysis of both current and ever-users. An analysis by time since stopping OC use revealed a significant trend in all ever-users, but the trends were much steeper in women of parity 1 or aged 30 to 34 years at diagnosis. There was no evidence that the increased rates in OC users were related to the oestrogen or progestogen dose. The 5 year survival rate in users diagnosed under the age of 35 years was significantly poorer than in comparable non-users. It is possible that the increased rates in younger OC users might be due to an accelerated presentation of breast cancer in those women who would otherwise have been diagnosed at a later time. The non-significant excess risk in users under 35 years of age was approximately 1 in 7,000 users per year. The unresolved discrepancies between the results of the published studies make it impossible at the present time to decide whether or not OC use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

A case-control study was conducted over a period of 11 months in an area containing one-third of the Swedish population. One thousand and one patients participated, constituting 94% of all women newly diagnosed as having breast cancer within the area. They were compared with 1,001 age-matched, non-hospitalized controls without breast cancer, selected by paired sampling from a population register. The risk of breast cancer was slightly, but significantly, related to parity, the standardized relative risk (SRR) being 1.35 for nulliparous women as compared to ever parous. In the different parity groups a risk significantly lower than that for nulliparous women was found only for women with more than 2 children (SRR = 0.59) but the trend with parity was highly significant (P less than 0.001). Age at first birth was not found to be an important risk factor for breast cancer. SRR was lower than for nulliparous women in all groups of women with their first birth before the age of 35 years, but the difference was significant (P less than 0.05) only for those with the first birth between 20 and 24 (SSR = 0.69) and 25 and 29 (SRR = 0.69) years of age. The trend with age at first birth (P less than 0.05) disappeared after stratification for parity, suggesting that it was a confounding factor.

An interview study of 1,362 breast cancer cases and 1,250 controls identified through a multi-centre screening project allowed an evaluation of reproductive determinants of breast cancer. Risk increased linearly with age at first livebirth; women with a birth after age 30 showed 4-5-fold excess risks compared to those with a birth prior to 18, while the risk for nulliparous women resembled that for women whose first birth was in their late twenties. The protection conferred by an early first pregnancy prevailed for pregnancies that ended in a livebirth or stillbirth, but not for those that terminated in other outcomes. Among parous women, a first trimester abortion prior to a livebirth was not associated with an elevated risk, except in the event of multiple miscarriages (RR = 2.2, 95% Cl 0.9-5.1). Although numbers were limited, women who reported an induced abortion in the absence of ever having a livebirth showed some elevation in risk. Age at first livebirth explained most associations, but some residual reduction in risk was noted for multiparous women and those with several births at an early age. There was evidence that delays in birth after marriage increased risk, but this did not explain the high risk associated with late age at first birth.

The present study examined the association between abortion prior to a first livebirth and breast cancer risk among a cohort of 3,315 women who had been delivered of liveborn children between 1946 and 1965 in a group of private gynaecology practices in Connecticut and followed through 1980 for the incidence of cancer. Among women with one livebirth at the time of cohort identification, a spontaneous abortion before this livebirth was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in the risk of breast cancer. The elevation in risk was independent of some of the major risk factors of breast cancer and became more pronounced as the number of years since the abortion increased.

The effect of reproductive factors on breast cancer risk was evaluated in a population-based case-control study, including 1,486 breast cancer cases diagnosed over a one-year period in Denmark. They were identified from the files of the nationwide trial of the Danish Breast Cancer Co-operative group and the Danish Cancer Registry. The control group was an age-stratified random sample of 1,336 women from the general population. Data on risk factors were collected by self-administered (mailed) questionnaires. Significantly increased relative risks (RR) were associated with never being pregnant (RR = 1.47), an early terminated first pregnancy (RR = 1.43), and having a natural menopause after the age of 54 (RR = 1.67). Trends of decreasing risk were observed by increasing parity and age at menarche. These findings were independent of age at first full-term pregnancy which overall was not related to breast cancer risk, though a weak association appeared in women less than 50 years at diagnosis. The study confirmed that pregnancies must continue to term to offer protection against breast cancer.	Risk of breast cancer in relation to reproductive factors in Denmark.	M. Ewertz, S. W.

Relations between previous lactation experience and risks of cancer of the breast and other sites were investigated after follow-up of 50,274 parous women from 1961 through 1980. Among women with complete information on lactation, 5102 developed cancer and, of these, 1136 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Analyses of associations with mean duration of lactation per birth and duration for each of the three first births suggested a nonlinear relation to breast cancer. The highest risk was observed for those with intermediate duration of breast feeding, whereas lower risks were found among those with very short or very long duration. For all nongenital cancers combined, decreased risks were observed among those with the longest duration of breast feeding. However, among cancers of specific sites, a significant inverse association was found for pancreatic cancer only. The overall impression given by our data is that breast feeding is not strongly related to risks of breast cancer or any other common cancer.

We have carried out a case-control study to evaluate the association between Wolfe's mammographic patterns and the risk of breast cancer, and to examine the influence of control selection and the radiologist who read the films upon the results obtained. Mammograms of the non-cancerous breast of 183 women with unilateral breast cancer were compared with mammograms from two age-matched control groups: a group of asymptomatic women attending a screening centre, and a group of symptomatic women referred for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected breast disease. Films were arranged in random sequence and independently classified by 3 radiologists. A strong and statistically significant association was found between mammographic dysplasia and breast cancer when controls from the screening centre were compared to cases, but not when cases were compared to women referred for the diagnostic evaluation of breast disease. This result appears to arise in part because of an association between symptoms of benign breast disease and mammographic dysplasia, and suggests that some previous negative studies of the association of mammographic patterns with breast cancer may have arisen from the inclusion of symptomatic subjects as controls.

In a comparative study of pre- and postmenopausal women with benign and malignant breast disease, a number of differences were observed in circulating plasma prolactin and lipid concentrations. Plasma lipids, phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol and free fatty acids were all higher in blood obtained from breast cancer patients prior to surgery. HDL-Cholesterol levels were significantly lower in these patients. These differences remained when the patient groups were sub-divided according to menopausal status. Plasma prolactin concentrations were also found to be higher in cancer compared with non-cancer patients, this effect being more marked in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. Premenopausal patients with invasive or poorly differentiated disease had significantly higher prolactin levels than those with non-invasive disease. No correlations were found between plasma prolactin and any of the lipid fractions.	Plasma lipids and prolactin in patients with breast cancer.	I. A. Bani, C. M. Williams, P. S. Boulter, J. W.

A previous paper in this series reported that genetic factors play a major role in the familial transmission of plasma (P) and red blood cell (RBC) magnesium (Mg) concentrations. We report here the results of commingling analysis based on a random sample of unrelated individuals, and complex segregation analysis of a random sample of nuclear families. For RBC Mg, there is evidence for a mixture of two distributions, but not for three. For P Mg, there is no evidence for commingling. Complex segregation analysis under a mixed model yielded significant support for a major gene effect on RBC Mg, but not on P Mg. Parameter estimates indicated that the data are compatible with a rather common major gene (q = .23) for elevated RBC Mg, roughly 5% of the population being homozygotes for this gene, that the nonfamilial factors account for a small fraction of the total variance, and that the overlap of distributions of homozygotes is not large.

Panels of somatic cell hybrid lines carrying various structural rearrangements of the human X chromosome short arm were analyzed with 21 X-chromosome-specific cloned DNA fragments. We mapped these molecular markers to five different regions of the short arm of the X chromosome. The results were confirmed by gene-dosage studies of human lymphoblasts with structurally abnormal X chromosomes.

The survival experience of 582 women with premenopausal breast cancer was examined to determine whether prognosis was related to body size or to demographic and reproductive factors. During the follow-up period 228 patients died and 18 emigrated or were lost to follow-up. Usual body weight, reported at the time of diagnosis, was a strong predictor of survival, with a statistically significant trend towards lower survival with increasing weight. Height and obesity (Quetelet index) were not significantly related to survival, although the tallest women and the most obese women appeared to fare worst. Other characteristics of prognostic importance were disease stage and reproductive history (women who were older when their first child was born fared better). Women aged 46-50 when diagnosed also appeared more likely to survive but no clear trend with age was evident. Other characteristics of the women including social class, cigarette use and oral contraceptive use were not significantly related to survival probability.

We have performed linkage analysis with five markers for the chromosome region 17q12-q21 in 13 Dutch breast cancer kindreds in order to find support for the claim by Hall et al. that a gene in this region, termed “BRCA1,” is associated with predisposition to early-onset familial breast cancer. This work is part of a collaborative study, the results of which are published elsewhere in this issue. Best evidence for linkage was observed with the marker CMM86 (D17S74) in pedigrees with an average age at onset of ≤47 years (LOD score = 1.77 at 1% recombination). In one breast-ovarian cancer family with a high probability of being linked to 17q, we observed one putative recombinant between D17S250 and D17S579, which suggests that BRCA1 is proximal to D17S579.

The estrogen-receptor locus is a candidate gene for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer, particularly among families with later onset, primarily estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. For one extended family with eight patients with late-onset disease, one estrogen-receptor haplotype was consistently coinherited with breast cancer, yielding a +1.85 lod score for linkage at zero recombination. Simulation of this pedigree assuming independent inheritance of breast cancer and estrogen-receptor genotypes led to a lod score greater than or equal to 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates. We suggest testing linkage of this gene to breast cancer in other families with late-onset disease.

The role of oncogenes in breast tumorigenesis is unclear. Alterations and/or amplification of several oncogene sequences have been observed in primary human breast tumors, in breast tumor cell lines, and in mammary tumors in model systems. In principle, such alterations could be sites of primary lesions for human breast cancer, causes of tumor progression or metastasis, or simply secondary lesions of highly aberrant tumor genomes. The present study tested genetic linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to nine oncogenes in 12 extended families including 87 affected individuals. Lod scores for close linkage of each candidate sequence to breast cancer were -19.6 for HRAS, -12.3 for KRAS2, -1.0 for NRAS, -6.0 for MYC, -6.1 for MYB, -8.2 for ERBA2, -7.9 for INT2, and -5.1 for RAF1. Regions of chromosome 11p associated with tumor homozygosity and the region of 3p carrying the gene for Von Hippel-Lindau disease could also be excluded from linkage to human breast cancer. The 5-kb allele of the MOS oncogene, previously proposed to be associated with breast cancer, was absent in these families, suggesting that polymorphism at this locus is not associated with inherited susceptibility. These results strongly suggest that oncogenes are not the sites of primary alterations leading to breast cancer. On the other hand, alterations in one or more of these sequences may be associated with tumor progression.ImagesFigure 1	Oncogenes and human breast cancer.

Workers in a modern electronics factory were surveyed by questionnaire and lung function testing to see if there was evidence of widespread work-related respiratory symptoms. Of the responding workers exposed to solder flux fumes on the shop floor, 22% had work-related breathlessness or wheeze or both. Exposed workers had a lower FEV1 and FVC than unexposed workers. Work-related rhinitis was also present in 22% of exposed workers. The most likely cause for these results is sensitivity to colophony fumes, released from solder flux during soldering. Levels of solder flux fume were below the threshold limit value in this factory during the survey.	Occupational asthma in an electronics factory.

Examination of the records of employees leaving an electronics factory over three-and-a-half years showed that a significantly greater proportion left the shop floor (where soldering took place) because of ill health than left the stores and office areas. This difference was largely due to work-related respiratory disease in those whose job was soldering. Shop floor workers leaving for health reasons also had increased sickness certification due to respiratory illness compared to stores and office workers. These findings suggest that work-related respiratory illness is a significant cause of morbidity and loss of employment in solderers working at the factory and that this has been a longstanding problem with its onset before the first recorded cases of occupational asthma caused by solder flux containing colophony.

The short preincubation of submitochondrial particles with low concentrations of ADP in the presence of Mg2+ results in a complete loss of their ATPase and inosine triphosphatase activities. Other nucleoside diphosphates (IDP and GDP) do not affect the ATPase activity. The ADP-inhibited ATPase can be activated in a time-dependent manner by treatment of submitochondrial particles with the enzyme converting ADP into ATP (phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase). The activaton is a first-order reaction with rate constant 0.2 min-1 at 25 degrees C. The rate constant of activation is increased in the presence of ATP up to 2 min-1, and this increase shows saturation kinetics with Km value equal to that for ATPase reaction itself (10(-4) M at 25 degrees C at pH 8.0). The experimental results obtained are consistent with the model where two alternative pathways of ADP dissociation from the inhibitory site of ATPase exist; one is spontaneous dissociation and the second is ATP-dependent dissociation through the formation of the ternary complex between ADP, the enzyme and ATP. ADP-induced inactivation and ATP-dependent activation of ATPase activity of submitochondrial particles is accompanied by the same directed change of their ability to catalyse the ATP-dependent reverse electron transport from succinate to NAD+. The possible implication of the model suggested is discussed in terms of functional role of the inhibitory high-affinity binding site for ADP in the mitochondrial ATPase.

1. A substantial increase of the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed after preincubation of bovine heart submitochondrial particles with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. 2. The activation was accompanied by an increase of Vmax, without change of Km for ATP. 3. The activated particles catalysed the biphasic hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system; the initial rapid phase was followed by a second, slower, phase in a time-dependent fashion. 4. The higher the ATP concentration used as a substrate, the higher is the rate of transition between these two phases. 5. The particles catalysed the hydrolysis of ITP with a lag phase; after preincubation with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase, ITP was hydrolysed at a constant rate. 6. Qualitatively the same phenomena were observed when soluble mitochondrial ATPase (F1-ATPase) prepared by the conventional method in the presence of ATP was used as nucleotide triphosphatase. 7. A kinetic scheme is proposed, in which the intermediate active enzyme-product complex (E.ADP) formed during ATP hydrolysis is in slow equilibrium with the inactive E*.ADP complex forming as a result of dislocation of ADP from the active site of ATPase to the other site, which is not in rapid equilibrium with the surrounding medium.

1. The magnitude of the protonmotive force in respiring bovine heart submitochondrial particles was estimated. The membrane-potential component was determined from the uptake of S14CN-ions, and the pH-gradient component from the uptake of [14C]methylamine. In each case a flow-dialysis technique was used to monitor uptake. 2. With NADH as substrate the membrane potential was approx. 145mV and the pH gradient was between 0 and 0.5 unit when the particles were suspended in a Pi/Tris reaction medium. The addition of the permeant NO3-ion decreased the membrane potential with a corresponding increase in the pH gradient. In a medium containing 200mM-sucrose, 50mM-KCl and Hepes as buffer, the total protonmotive force was 185mV, comprising a membrane potential of 90mV and a pH gradient of 1.6 units. Thus the protonmotive force was slightly larger in the high-osmolarity medium. 3. The phosphorylation potential (= deltaG0' + RT ln[ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) was approx. 43.1 kJ/mol (10.3kcal/mol) in all the reaction media tested. Comparison of this value with the protonmotive force indicates that more than 2 and up to 3 protons must be moved across the membrane for each molecule of ATP synthesized by a chemiosmotic mechanism. 4. Succinate generated both a protonmotive force and a phosphorylation potential that were of similar magnitude to those observed with NADH as substrate. 5. Although oxidation of NADH supports a rate of ATP synthesis that is approximately twice that observed with succinate, respiration with either of these substrates generated a very similar protonmotive force. Thus there seemed to be no strict relation between the size of the protonmotive force and the phosphorylation rate. 6. In the presence of antimycin and/or 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, ascorbate oxidation with either NNN'N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine or 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as electron mediator generated a membrane potential of approx. 90mV, but no pH gradient was detected, even in the presence of NO3-. These data are discussed with reference to the proposal that cytochrome oxidase contains a proton pump.	The protonmotive force in bovine heart submitochondrial particles.

1. The naturally occurring ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase)-inhibitor protein, from bovine heart mitochondria, was obtained as a single pure protein. It was not identical with any of the five subunits (α–ε) of the isolated ATPase, and appeared to be a single polypeptide chain. 2. The inhibitor combined with the ATPase in a 1:1 molar ratio, producing a completely inhibited ATPase molecule. The affinity of the ATPase for its inhibitor is high; the Kd is of the order of 10−8m. 3. The enthalpy of the ATPase–inhibitor complex-formation is positive, the value of Kd decreasing as the temperature is raised. This suggests that the forces involved are largely hydrophobic in nature. 4. Hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate promoted formation of the ATPase–inhibitor complex, although the equilibrium position was almost unaffected by the rate of hydrolysis. At low salt concentration, less than 200 turnovers of the ATPase suffice for the ATPase to combine with the inhibitor protein. At higher salt concentrations, a larger number of turnovers is required. It is suggested that the inhibitor binds to a form of the ATPase that is produced transiently during hydrolysis. 5. In the presence of 75mm-K2SO4, the rates of association and dissociation are slow enough to allow their kinetics to be studied. Association is first-order in inhibitor concentration, but fractional order in ATPase concentration. Dissociation is first-order in ATPase–inhibitor complex concentration. The temperature coefficients of the `on' and `off' processes were also measured. 6. A simple kinetic model for the ATPase–inhibitor interaction is proposed that can be extended to take into account release of inhibitor protein under energized conditions on the membrane. 7. The isolated ATPase is inhibited by preincubation with Mg2+, reversible by subsequent addition of EDTA, and by ADP, reversible by subsequent addition of ATP. These effects are not found on the membrane-bound ATPase. The mechanism of these effects is discussed.

1. The initial rapid phase of ATP hydrolysis by bovine heart submitochondrial particles or by soluble F1-ATPase is insensitive to anion activation (sulphite) or inhibition (azide). 2. The second slow phase of ATP hydrolysis is hyperbolically inhibited by azide (Ki approximately 10(-5) M); the inosine triphosphatase activity of submitochondrial particles or F1-ATPase is insensitive to azide or sulphite. 3. The rate of interconversion between rapid azide-insensitive and slow azide-sensitive phases of ATP hydrolysis does not depend on azide concentration, but strongly depends on ATP concentration. 4. Sulphite prevents the interconversion of the rapid initial phase of the reaction into the slower second phase, and also prevents and slowly reverses the inhibition by azide. 5. The presence of sulphite in the mixture when ADP reacts with ATPase of submitochondrial particles changes the pattern of the following activation process. 6. Azide blocks the activation of ATP-inhibited ATPase of submitochondrial particles by phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. 7. The results obtained suggest that the inhibiting effect of azide on mitochondrial ATPase is due to stabilization of inactive E*.ADP complex formed during ATP hydrolysis; the activation of ATPase by sulphite is also realized through the equilibrium between intermediate active E.ADP complex and inactive E*.ADP complex.

1. Pulsed acid–base titrations of suspensions of rat-liver mitochondria under anaerobic equilibrium conditions show fast and slow titration processes. 2. The fast process is the titration of the outer aqueous phase of the mitochondria, which is continuous with the suspension medium, and the slow process can be identified with the titration of the inner aqueous phase of the mitochondria, which is separated from the outer aqueous phase by the non-aqueous osmotic barrier or M phase of the cristae membrane system. 3. The buffering power of the outer and inner phases have been separately measured over a range of pH values. 4. The rate of titration of the inner aqueous phase under a known protonmotive force across the M phase has been characterized by an effective proton conductance coefficient, which, near pH7 and at 25°, is only 0·45μmho/cm.2 of the M-phase membrane. 5. The low effective proton conductance of the M phase will account quantitatively for the observed respiratory control in state 4, assuming that oxidoreduction and phosphorylation are coupled by a circulating proton current as required by the chemi-osmotic hypothesis. 6. The addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) at normal uncoupling concentrations causes a large increase in the effective proton conductance of the M phase of the cristae membrane. 7. The increase of the effective proton conductance of the M phase by 2,4-dinitrophenol (or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) will account quantitatively for the short-circuiting effect of the uncoupling agent on the proton current and for the observed rise of the rate of respiration to that characteristic of state 3 or higher.

The stoichiometry of H+ ejection by mitochondria during hydrolysis of a small pulse of ATP (the H+/ATP ratio) has been reexamined in the light of our recent observation that the stoichiometry of H+ ejection during mitochondrial electron transport (the H+/site ratio) was previously underestimated. We show that earlier estimates of the H+/ATP ratio in intact mitochondria were based upon an invalid correction for scaler H+ production and describe a modified method for determination of this ratio which utilizes mersalyl or N-ethylmaleimide to prevent complicating transmembrane movements of phosphate and H+. This method gives a value for the H+/ATP ratio of 2.0 without the need for questionable corrections, compared with a value of 3.0 for the H+/site ratio also obtained by pulse methods. A modified version of the chemiosmotic theory is presented, in which 3 H+ are ejected per pair of electrons traversing each energy-conserving site of the respiratory chain. Of these, 2 H+ return to the matrix through the ATPase to form ATP from ADP and phosphate, and 1 H+ returns through the combined action of the phosphate and adenine nucleotide exchange carriers of the inner membrane to allow the energy-requiring influx of Pi and ADP3- and efflux of ATP4-. Thus, up to one-third of the energy input into synthesis of extramitochondrial ATP may be required for transport work. Since other methods suggest that the H+/site significantly exceeds 3.0, an alternative possibility is that 4 h+ are ejected per site, followed by return of 3 H+ through the ATPase and 1 H+ through the operation of the proton-coupled membrane transport systems.

1. The magnitude of the protonmotive force in phosphorylating membrane vesicles from Paracoccus denitrificans was estimated. The membrane potential component was determined from the uptake of S14CN−, and the transmembrane pH gradient component from the uptake of [14C]methylamine. In each case a flow-dialysis technique was used to monitor uptake. 2. With NADH as substrate, the membrane potential was about 145mV and the pH gradient was below 0.5 pH unit. The membrane potential was decreased by approx. 15mV during ATP synthesis, and was abolished on addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. In the presence of KCl plus valinomycin the membrane potential was replaced by a pH gradient of 1.5 units. 3. Succinate oxidation generated a membrane potential of approx. 125mV and the pH gradient was below 0.5 pH unit. Oxidation of ascorbate (in the presence of antimycin) with either 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine or NNN′N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as electron mediator usually generated a membrane potential of approx. 90mV. On occasion, ascorbate oxidation did not generate a membrane potential, suggesting that the presence of a third energy-coupling site in P. denitrificans vesicles is variable. 4. With NADH or succinate as substrate, the phosphorylation potential (ΔGp=ΔG0′+RTln[ATP]/ [ADP][Pi]) was approx. 53.6kJ/mol (12.8kcal/mol). Comparison of this value with the protonmotive force indicates that more than 3 protons need to be translocated via the adenosine triphosphatase of P. denitrificans for each molecule of ATP synthesized by a chemiosmotic mechanism. In the presence of 10mm-KNO3 the protonmotive force was not detectable (<60mV) but ΔGp was not altered. This result may indicate either that there is no relationship between the protonmotive force and ΔGp, or that for an unidentified reason the equilibration of SCN− or methylamine with the membrane potential and the pH gradient is prevented by NO3− in this system.

A phosphorylation potential deltaGp, where deltaGp = deltaGo' + RT2.303 log  ([ATP]/([ADP][Pi])), of approx. 44.3 kJ.mol-1 (10.6 kcal.mol-1) was generated by submitochondrial particles that were oxidizing either NADH or succinate. Addition of adenylyl imidodiphosphate, which should suppress adenosine triphosphatase activity of any uncoupled particles, did not raise the phosphorylation potential. Raising the Pi concentration slightly increased the magnitude of the value for [ATP]/[ADP], but this did not fully compensate for the increased Pi concentration, so that the phosphorylation potential decreased slightly as the Pi concentration was raised. The phosphorylation potential developed by submitochondrial particles is lower than that generated by phosphorylating membrane vesicles from some bacteria, and is also less than that developed externally by mitochondria, but is strikingly close to the phosphorylation potential that is generated internally by mitochondria.

1. The activity of the ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) of phosphorylating particles prepared by sonication of bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of MgCl2 and ATP is influenced by the isolation method for the mitochondria used in the preparation of particles. Type-I particles, made from mitochondria isolated in a medium lacking succinate, have a lower ATPase activity than to Type-II particles, which are prepared from mitochondria isolated in a medium containing succinate. 2. Centrifugation under appropriate energized conditions increases the ATPase activity of Type-I particles almost to that of the Type-II particles. The ATPase activity of Type-II particles was only slightly stimulated by this procedure. These data are interpreted as indicating a higher content of the ATPase-inhibitor protein in the Type-I particles. 3. A comparison was made of the ATP-driven enhancement of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonate fluorescence and the exchange of the endogenous tightly bound nucleotides of the ATPase in Type-I and Type-II particles. The effect of exogenous inhibitor protein on both these reactions was also studied. 4. The time-scale on which the inhibitor protein can exchange between ATPase molecules is discussed.

Measurements of extra oxygen consumption, 45Ca2+ uptake, and the osmotic expansion of the matrix compartment show that not all permeant anions are capable of supporting and accompanying the energy-dependent transport of Ca2+ from the medium into the matrix in respiring rat-liver mitochondria. Phosphate, arsenate, acetate, butyrate, β-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and bicarbonate + CO2 supported Ca2+ uptake, whereas the permeant anions, nitrate, thiocyanate, chlorate, and perchlorate, did not. The active anions share a common denominator, the potential ability to donate a proton to the mitochondrial matrix; the inactive anions lack this capacity. Phosphate and the other active permeant anions move into the matrix in response to the alkaline-inside electrochemical gradient of protons generated across the mitochondrial membrane by electron transport, thus forming a negative-inside anion gradient. It is postulated that the latter gradient is the immediate “pulling” force for the influx of Ca2+ on the electrogenic Ca2+ carrier in respiring mitochondria under intracellular conditions. Since mitochondria in the cell are normally exposed to an excess of phosphate (and the bicarbonate-CO2 system), particularly in state 4, inward transport of these proton-yielding anions probably precedes and is necessary for inward transport of Ca2+ and other cations under biological conditions. These observations indicate that a negative-inside gradient of phosphate generated by electron transport is a common step and provides the immediate motive power not only for (a) the inward transport of dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates and (b) the energy-dependent exchange of external ADP3- for internal ATP4- during oxidative phosphorylation, as has already been established, but also for (c) the inward transport of Ca2+, K+, and other cations.

Membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli generate a trans-membrane proton gradient of 2 pH units under appropriate conditions when assayed by flow dialysis. Using the distribution of weak acids to measure the proton gradient (deltapH) and the distribution of the lipophilic cation triphenyl-methylphosphonium to measure the electrical potential across the membrane (delta psi), the vesicles are shown to generate an electrochemical proton gradient (deltamuH+) of approximately-180 mV at pH 5.5 in the presence of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate, the major component of which is a deltapH of about -110mV. As external pH is increased, deltapH decreases, reaching 0 at pH 7.5 and above, while delta psi remains at about-75 mV and internal pH remains at pH 7.5. Moreover, the ability of various electron donors to drive transport is correlated with their ability to generate deltamuH+. In addition, deltapH and delta psi can be varied reciprocally in the presence of valinomycin and nigericin. These data and others (manuscript in preparation) provide convincing support for the role of chemiosmotic phenomena in active transport.

The number of protons ejected during electron transport per pair of electrons per energy-conserving site (the H+/site ratio) was measured in rat liver mitochondria by three different methods under conditions in which transmembrane movements of endogenous phosphate were minized or eliminated. (1) In the Ca2+ pulse method, between 3.5 and 4.0 molecules of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 1.75 to 2.0 Ca2+ ions were accumulated per 2 e- per site during Ca2+ induced electron transport in the presence of rotenone, when measured under conditions in which movements of endogenous phosphate were negligible. Since entry of 3-hydroxybutyrate requires its protonation to the free acid these data correspond to an H+/site ratio of 3.5-4.0 (2) In the oxygen pulse method addition of known amounts of oxygen to anaerobic mitochondria in the presence of substrate yielded H+/site ratios of 3.0 when phosphate transport was eliminated by addition of N-ethylmaleimide or by anaerobic washing to remove endogenous phosphate. In the absence of such measures the observed H+/site ratio was 2.0. (3) In the reductant pulse method measurement of the initial steady rates of H+ ejection and oxygen consumption by mitochondria in an aerobic medium after addition of substrate gave H+/site near 4.0 in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide; in the absence of the inhibitor the observed ratio was only 2.0. These and other experiments reported indicate that the values of 2.0 earlier obtained for the H+/site ratio by Mitchell and Moyle [Biochem J. (1967) 105, 1147-1162] and others were underestimates due to the unrecognized masking of H+ ejection by movements of endogenous phosphate. The results presented here show that the H+/site ratio of mitochondrial electron transport is at least 3.0 and may be as high as 4.0.

Purified dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATPase (TF0-F1) from thermophilic bacterium PS3 is composed of a water soluble part with ATP hydrolytic activity (TF1) and a water insoluble moiety (TF0). All of the five subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) of TF1 were isolated. TF1 was reconstituted from the five subunits, which catalyzed an ATP-32Pi exchange and an ATP-driven enhancement of fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate, when adsorbed on proteoliposome inlaid with TF0 (TF3-vesicles). Subunit epsilon and/or delta became firmly bound to TF0-vesicles and there was no preferential sequence in the binding. Both subunits were required for binding of the remaining subunits of TF1 to TF0-vesicles, but they did not modify the high H+ -permeability of TF0-vesicles. The addition of gamma but they did not modify the high H+-permeability of TFO-vesicles. The addition of gamma subunit together with epsilon and delta subunits caused a marked decrease of H+ -permeability of TF0-vesicles, similar to that induced by TF1. We conclude tentatively that the epsilon and delta subunits connect TF0 and the other subunits forming a part of a proton pathway, gamma is a gate of proton flow coupled to ATP hydrolysis (or synthesis), and alpha and beta subunits contain the active site for energy transformation. A possible model of subunit structure of TF1 is proposed.	Reconstitution of thermostable ATPase capable of energy coupling from its purified subunits.

1. Investigation of a number of reactions involving both internal and externally added adenine nucleotides of isolated liver mitochondria has revealed that atractylate and oligomycin differ markedly in the site of their inhibitory action. 2. Both atractylate and oligomycin inhibited the respiratory-chain-level phosphorylation of added ADP. Neither compound inhibited the substrate-level phosphorylation of internal (endogenous) ADP or the respiration-dependent accumulation of bivalent metal ions (Ca2+, Sr2+ or Mn2+). 3. Atractylate, but not oligomycin, inhibited the substrate-level phosphorylation of externally added ADP, the ATP- and carnitine-dependent reduction of nicotinamide nucleotide by palmitate and the ATP-induced activation of succinate oxidation. 4. Oligomycin, but not atractylate, inhibited the respiratory-chain-linked phosphorylation of internal ADP, and the dephosphorylation of internal ATP that occurred on the addition of antimycin. 5. The enhancement of arsenate-stimulated respiration by ADP was prevented by atractylate added either before or after the ADP. Oligomycin abolished both the arsenate and ADP stimulation. 6. It is suggested that atractylate prevents the passage of adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial membrane, whereas oligomycin interferes with the formation of a `high-energy' phosphorylated intermediate.

"By means of a new ""quick-sampling"" method, micropellets of mouse liver mitochondria were rapidly prepared for electron microscopy during the recording of steady state metabolism. Reversible ultrastructural changes were found to accompany change in metabolic steady states. The most dramatic reversible ultrastructural change occurs when ADP is added to systems in which only phosphate acceptor is deficient, i.e., during the State IV to State III transition as defined by Chance and Williams. After 15 min in State IV, mitochondria display an ""orthodox"" ultrastructural appearance as is usually observed after fixation within intact tissue. On transition to State III, a dramatic change in the manner of folding of the inner membrane takes place. In addition, the electron opacity of the matrix increases as the volume of the matrix decreases, but total mitochondrial volume does not appear to change during this transition. This conformation is called ""condensed."" Isolated mitochondria were found to oscillate between the orthodox and condensed conformations during reversible transitions between State III and State IV. Various significant ultrastructural changes in mitochondria also occur during transitions in other functional states, e.g., when substrate or substrate and acceptor is made limiting. Internal structural flexibility is discussed with respect to structural and functional integrity of isolated mitochondria. Reversible changes in the manner of folding of the inner membrane and in the manner of packing of small granules in the matrix as respiration is activated by ADP represent an ultrastructural basis for metabolically linked mechanical activity in tightly coupled mitochondria."

1. Pulses of acidity of the outer aqueous phase of rat liver mitochondrial suspensions induced by pulses of respiration are due to the translocation of H+ (or OH−) ions across the osmotic barrier (M phase) of the cristae membrane and cannot be attributed to the formation (with acid production) of a chemical intermediate that subsequently decomposes. 2. The effective quantity of protons translocated per bivalent reducing equivalent passing through the succinate-oxidizing and β-hydroxybutyrate-oxidizing spans of the respiratory chain are very close to 4 and 6 respectively. These quotients are constant between pH5·5 and 8·5 and are independent of changes in the ionic composition of the mitochondrial suspension medium provided that the conditions permit the accurate experimental measurement of the proton translocation. 3. Apparent changes in the →H+/O quotients may be induced by conditions preventing the occurrence of the usual backlash; these apparent changes of →H+/O are attributable to a very fast electrically driven component of the decay of the acid pulses that is not included in the experimental extrapolations. 4. Apparent changes in the →H+/O quotients may also be induced by the presence of anions, such as succinate, malonate and phosphate, or by cations such as Na+. These apparent changes of →H+/O are due to an increase in the rate of the pH-driven decay of the acid pulses. 5. The uncoupling agents, 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and gramicidin increase the effective proton conductance of the M phase and thus increase the rate of decay of the respiration-driven acid pulses, but do not change the initial →H+/O quotients. The increase in effective proton conductance of the M phase caused by these uncouplers accounts quantitatively for their uncoupling action; and the fact that the initial →H+/O quotients are unchanged shows that uncoupler-sensitive chemical intermediates do not exist between the respiratory-chain system and the effective proton-translocating mechanism. 6. Stoicheiometric acid–base changes associated with the activity of the regions of the respiratory chain on the oxygen side of the rotenone- and antimycin A-sensitive sites gives experimental support for a suggested configuration of loop 3.

An uncoupler-sensitive active transport of sulphate into membrane vesicles prepared from the plasma membrane of Paracoccus denitrificans (previously Micrococcus denitrificans) can be driven by respiration or by a trans-membrane pH gradient (alkaline inside) generated by the addition either of KCL ( in the presence of nigericin) or of NH4CL. Valinomycin does not substitute for nigericin. Respiration-driven transport is observed in right-side-out vesicles but not in inside-out vesicles, whereas transport driven by the addition of KCL (in the presence of nigericin) or of NH4CL is observed in both types of membrane vesicle. The active transport of sulphate into these vesicles is shown to be carrier-mediated by its sensitivity to thiol-group reagents. It is proposed that the sulphate carrier in the plasma membrane of P. denitrificans operates by a mechanism of electroneutral proton symport, and is capable of actively transporting sulphate in either direction across the plasma membrane, but that in whole cells respiration-driven proton expulsion drives the accumulative uptake of sulphate.

The reaction of the fluorochrome, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS), with fragmented membranes from beef heart mitochondria has been studied. ANS fluorescence is found to be enhanced 25-fold on binding to the membrane fragments in the absence of energy conservation, and this enhancement is increased to 35-fold in the membrane energized by substrate plux oxygen. The fluorescence of bound ANS depends upon the energy state of the membrane fragments, as indicated by the effects of ATP, substrates of the respiratory chain, oligomycin, and uncouplers. It is concluded that the changes of ANS fluorescence indicate structural changes of the mitochondrial membrane associated with energy conservation. The time course of energization is readily followed by ANS, and has a half-time of two seconds at 26°.	A FLUORESCENCE PROBE OF ENERGY-DEPENDENT STRUCTURE CHANGES IN FRAGMENTED MEMBRANES*	A. Azzi, B.

1. Liver mitochondria suspended in an iso-osmotic buffered potassium chloride medium containing an oxidizable substrate and phosphate accumulated added Ca2+. During this process H+ appeared in the medium and the mitochondrial suspension showed increased light-scattering. Respiration was markedly stimulated. 2. The addition of excess of Ca2+, respiratory inhibitors or uncoupling agents caused extensive mitochondrial swelling associated with release of Ca2+ into the suspending medium. When the suspension became anaerobic extensive swelling also occurred. Only under conditions when the addition of uncoupling agents would have produced high rates of electron transport, e.g. in the presence of succinate, was the structural integrity of the mitochondrion maintained after Ca2+ accumulation. 3. Conditions that prevented respiration-dependent Ca2+ accumulation also prevented Ca2+-induced swelling. Bovine plasma albumin was without effect, indicating that U-factor was not involved. Oligomycin together with ADP or ATP partially stabilized the mitochondria against Ca2+-induced swelling. 4. It is suggested that a `high-energy' intermediate generated by coupled electron transport is required to prevent the mitochondrial swelling that results as a consequence of Ca2+ accumulation.

Extraction of E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles with chaotropic agents causes the vesicles to become specifically permeable to protons. As a result, the vesicles no longer generate a membrane potential, interior negative, and they do not catalyze respiration-dependent lactose or proline transport. Treatment of the extracted vesicles with various carbodiimides decreases the permeability of the vesicle membrane to protons, causing them to regain their ability to generate a membrane potential. By this means, active transport is completely reactivated. Exposure of the vesicles to carbodiimides prior to extraction with chaotropic agents makes transport activity impervious to the effects of the chaotropes.

"High specific activity 6'-N-[3H]dansyl)aminohexyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (Dns6-Gal) has been synthesized, and its binding to Escherichia coli membrane vesicles measured directly by flow dialysis. With ML 308-225 vesicles containing the lac carrier protein, specific binding is not detected in the absence of D-lactate or reduced phenazine methosulfate. In the presence of these electron donors, binding is observed, and the binding constant and number of binding sites are approximately 4 muM and 1.5 nmol/mg of membrane protein, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with those obtained by fluorescence titration. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, which directly inactivates the lac carrier protein, and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which collapses the membrane potential, cause release of bound Dns6-Gal. Moreover, significant binding is not observed with membrane vesicles that are devoid of the lac carrier protein. The results provide qualitative and quantitative confirmation of previous studies which indicate that changes in dansylgalactoside fluorescence observed on ""energization"" of membrane vesicles reflect binding of the probe to the lac carrier protein."

Membrane vesicles from E. coli can oxidize D-lactate and other substrates and couple respiration to the active transport of sugars and amino acids. The present experiments bear on the nature of the link between respiration and transport.Respiring vesicles were found to accumulate dibenzyldimethylammonium ion, a synthetic lipid-soluble cation that serves as an indicator of an electrical potential. The results suggest that oxidation of D-lactate generates a membrane potential, vesicle interior negative, of the order of -100 mV. In vesicles lacking substrate, an electrical potential was created by induction of electrogenic efflux of K+ with the aid of the K+ ionophores, valinomycin and monactin. These conditions induced transient accumulation by the vesicles of [14C]proline and other metabolites. Experiments with inhibitors and ionophores indicate that neither ATP nor the respiratory chain is involved; the electrical potential generated by K+ efflux is coupled directly to the transport systems. The results verify two predictions derived from Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis: respiring vesicles generate an electrical potential of the proper polarity and magnitude; and a membrane potential is in itself sufficient to drive the active transport of amino acids and other metabolites.

Addition of ubiquinone-1 to E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between NADH oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are comparable to those observed during D-lactate oxidation. Similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or L-lactate. In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site. The findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of NADH oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted vesicles. In addition, they provide further support for specific localization of the energy-coupling site.

1. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibited the influx and efflux of Pi in rat liver mitochondria. 2. The efflux was stimulated by either succinate or malate in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, and this stimulation was reversed by 2-n-butylmalonate. 2-Oxoglutarate and citrate, even in the presence of low concentrations of malate, were relatively ineffective in stimulating efflux of Pi under these conditions, as was glutamate. 3. By using radioactively labelled Pi and dicarboxylate ions an exchange was demonstrated, the stoicheiometry of which was 1.3±0.5 dicarboxylate ions:1 Pi (n=10). 4. An exchange between unlabelled and labelled Pi in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide was found which was sensitive to 2-n-butylmalonate. 5. It is concluded that the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier can transport phosphate by an exchange diffusion with certain penetrant dicarboxylic acids or with phosphate itself. The exchange mechanism is sensitive to 2-n-butylmalonate but is unaffected by N-ethylmaleimide; the action of mersalyl in this context is commented on.

Measurements were made of the stoicheiometry of proton-translocation coupled to NAD(P)H oxidation by several quinones (duroquinone, ubiquinone0, ubiquinone1, ubiquinone2) in mitochondria from rat liver and ox heart. Observed stoicheiometries of protons translocated per mol of NADH oxidized (→H+/2e− ratios; Mitchell, 1966) ranged from 0.75 (rat liver mitochondria with ubiquinone1) to 1.55 (ox heart mitochondria with ubiquinone1 or ubiquinone2). Only the rotenone-sensitive pathway of NADH oxidation by quinone was able to support proton translocation. Correction of the observed →H+/2e− ratios for the loss of reducing equivalents to the rotenone-insensitive pathway increased their value to approx. 2.0. It is concluded that the rotenone-sensitive NADH– ubiquinone reductase activity of the respiratory chain may be organized in the mitochondrial membrane as a proton-translocating oxidoreduction loop. The number of such loops between NADH and ubiquinone is one, and not two, as initially proposed by Mitchell (1966).

Measurements were made of the stoicheiometry of proton translocation coupled to respiration in mitochondria from Candida utilis where the number of functional energy-conservation sites between intramitochondrial NADH and oxygen was one in a mutant with a novel oxidase (Downie & Garland, 1972), two in sulphate-deficient cells (Haddock & Garland, 1971) or three in glycerol-limited cells (Light & Garland, 1971). The stoicheiometries of protons translocated per atom of oxygen utilized (i.e. →H+/2e− ratio; Mitchell, 1966) were close to 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 respectively. Thus by using the same substrate (intramitochondrial NADH) and oxygen throughout, the →H+/2e− ratio is shown to be 2.0 per energy-conservation site when the number of such sites is varied from one to three.

The fine structure of several strains of green bacteria belonging to the genus Chlorobium has been studied in thin sections with the electron microscope. In addition to having general cytological features typical of Gram-negative bacteria, the cells of these organisms always contain membranous mesosomal elements, connected with the cytoplasmic membrane, and an elaborate system of isolated cortical vesicles, some 300 to 400 A wide and 1000 to 1500 A long. The latter structures, chlorobium vesicles, have been isolated in a partly purified state by differential centrifugation of cell-free extracts. They are associated with a centrifugal fraction that has a very high specific chlorophyll content. In all probability, therefore, the chlorobium vesicles are the site of the photosynthetic apparatus of green bacteria.

The Mg2+- and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3; ATP phosphohydrolase) (bacterial coupling factor) was purified from two strains of E. coli by two different procedures: (a) method of Nelson, Kanner, and Gutnick [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA (1974) 71, 2720-2724] and (b) a modified procedure described in this paper. The ATPase purified from E. coli K12 (λ) by the first procedure had 4 subunits (α, β, γ, and ε). It did not bind to a deficient membrane, nor did it reconstitute ATP-driven transhydrogenase activity. Our modified procedure (b) yielded 5 subunits (α, β, γ, δ, and ε). This ATPase could bind to a deficient membrane and reconstitute ATP-driven transhydrogenase. This finding suggests that the δ subunit is required for the reaction with the membrane. The molecular weight of the 4-subunit ATPase was significantly lower than that of the 5-subunit ATPase, as judged by equilibrium centrifugation. The specific ATPase activities of both preparations were about the same. These two procedures were also applied to E. coli ML308-225.Images	Purification and Properties of Reconstitutively Active and Inactive Adenosinetriphosphatase from Escherichia coli	Masamitsu Futai, Paul C.

A procedure for the purification of Mg2+-Ca2+ adenosinetriphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) from E. coli, yielding relatively large amounts of highly active enzyme, is described. The enzyme consists of four nonidentical subunits. Trypsin treatment of purified enzyme yields a preparation consisting exclusively of the two larger subunits, which are sufficient for ATPase activity. Purified enzyme is inhibited by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; this inhibition is reversed by dithiothreitol, and the diazole is found preferentially associated with the β-subunit of the enzyme. Antibody prepared against the trypsin-treated enzyme inhibited various ATP-dependent reactions as well as membrane-bound ATPase itself.Images	Purification and Properties of Mg2+-Ca2+ Adenosinetriphosphatase from Escherichia coli	Nathan Nelson, Baruch I.

1. Nuclei prepared from calf thymus tissue in a sucrose medium actively incorporate labelled amino acids into their proteins. This is an aerobic process which is dependent on nuclear oxidative phosphorylation. 2. Evidence is presented to show that the uptake of amino acids represents nuclear protein synthesis. 3. The deoxyribonucleic acid of the nucleus plays a role in amino acid incorporation. Protein synthesis virtually ceases when the DNA is removed from the nucleus, and uptake resumes when the DNA is restored. 4. In the essential mechanism of amino acid incorporation, the role of the DNA can be filled by denatured or partially degraded DNA, by DNAs from other tissues, and even by RNA. Purine and pyrimidine bases, monoribonucleotides, and certain dinucleotides are unable to substitute for DNA in this system. 5. When the proteins of the nucleus are fractionated and classified according to their specific activities, one finds the histones to be relatively inert. The protein fraction most closely associated with the DNA has a very high activity. A readily extractable ribonucleoprotein complex is also extremely active, and it is tempting to speculate that this may be an intermediary in nucleocytoplasmic interaction. 6. The isolated nucleus can incorporate glycine into nucleic acid purines, and orotic acid into the pyrimidines of its RNA. Orotic acid uptake into nuclear RNA requires the presence of the DNA. 7. The synthesis of ribonucleic acid can be inhibited at any time by a benzimidazole riboside (DRB) (which also retards influenza virus multiplication (11)). 8. The incorporation of amino acids into nuclear proteins seems to require a preliminary activation of the nucleus. This can be inhibited by the same benzimidazole derivative (DRB) which interferes with RNA synthesis, provided that the inhibitor is present at the outset of the incubation. DRB added 30 minutes later has no effect on nuclear protein synthesis. These results suggest that the activation of the nucleus so that it actively incorporates amino acids into its proteins requires a preliminary synthesis of ribonucleic acid. 9. Together with earlier observations (27, 28) on the incorporation of amino acids by cytoplasmic particulates, these results show that protein synthesis can occur in both nucleus and cytoplasm.

1. It has been demonstrated by ion exchange chromatography that the cell nucleus contains mononucleotides of adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, together with diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and several uridine diphosphate derivatives; the adenine nucleotides predominating in amount. Nucleotide components in the cell nucleus are in close agreement both quantitatively and qualitatively with those found in the cytoplasm. 2. In calf thymus sucrose nuclei, nucleotide monophosphates can be phosphorylated to the energy-rich triphosphate form without participation of cytoplasmic components. As to the nature of the phosphorylation, it has been shown that there exist certain differences as well as resemblances between nuclei and mitochondria. A distinctive feature of nuclear phosphorylation is that only intranuclear monophosphates seem to be phosphorylated. The process is completely inhibited by cyanide, azide, and dinitrophenol. However, certain reagents which block oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria, namely dicumarol, Janus green B, methylene blue, and calcium ions, have no effect on phosphorylation within the nucleus. 3. The bulk of mononucleotides is preserved within thymus nuclei after their isolation in sucrose. Nucleotides are surprisingly well retained by nuclei in a sucrose medium whether or not electrolytes are present and in buffers ranging from pH 3 to 10; under all conditions sucrose is required for retention. 4. Dilute acetate in sucrose releases nucleotides from the nucleus below pH 5.1. As to the effective pH of acetate, there is a sharp boundary between pH 5.1 and pH 5.9. At pH 5.9, and above, acetate does not remove nucleotides from the nucleus. The effects of propionate, formate, and monochloroacetate on the nuclei are the same as that of acetate. 5. When nuclei are exposed to a wide variety of conditions a close correlation is found between the retention in the nucleus of nucleotides and of potassium. This suggests that both substances are part of a common complex in the cell nucleus. 6. It has been shown that upon removal of nucleotides and potassium from calf thymus sucrose nuclei by acetate, the ability to incorporate C14-alanine into nuclear protein is greatly impaired.

1. Gramicidin caused H+ production by liver mitochondria; this process was dependent on the presence of Na+, Li+, Rb+ or Cs+. In the presence of one of these alkali-metal ions and phosphate, gramicidin caused mitochondrial swelling and increased oxygen consumption. 2. Uncoupling agents, anaerobic conditions or respiratory inhibitors both inhibited and reversed H+ production and swelling. Both these processes could be supported by coupled electron transport through even a restricted portion of the respiratory chain. 3. NH4+ also caused stimulation of respiration in the presence of gramicidin. In this case phosphate was not required. NH4+, in the presence of gramicidin, caused contraction of the mitochondria and a reversal of K+-induced swelling and H+ production. 4. Uncoupling agents or NH4+ together with gramicidin caused the release of Sr2+ that had been accumulated by mitochondria in the presence of phosphate. 5. These results are discussed in relation to a postulated respiration-dependent H+ pump located in the mitochondrial membrane. It is suggested that gramicidin allows alkali-metal ions to pass through the mitochondrial membrane.	Gramicidin and ion transport in isolated liver mitochondria	J. B. Chappell, A. R.

The morphology of rabbit heart muscle mitochondria isolated in several media has been compared by electron microscopy. The internal structure of isolated mitochondria differs from that of in situ mitochondria, with the type and degree of alteration depending on the isolation medium. Examination of the isolated mitochondria after incubation revealed that additional morphological changes occurred during incubation, but these changes were less pronounced when the incubation was conducted in a complete medium containing substrate. The isolated mitochondria have been shown to be capable of catalyzing a slow aerobic oxidation of extramitochondrial reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. The rate of DPNH oxidation observed is sufficient to account for the ability of the mitochondria to oxidize lactate in the presence of catalytic amounts of DPNH. The suspensions used were essentially free of mitochondrial fragments, which are known to oxidize DPNH. Possible relationships of these findings to metabolism in situ are discussed. The results indicate the desirability of correlating biochemical activities with the morphology of isolated mitochondria.

Direct electron microscopic evidence is reported of the ultrastructure of mitochondrial membranes and compartments in mitochondria isolated in 0.5 M sucrose from the rat kidney cortex and the experimental changes they undergo with phlorizin and ATP treatment. A heterogeneous population of mitochondria is recognized under control conditions. The mitochondria appear to be of 3 main types, normal, swollen, and contracted. Under phlorizin treatment, most of the mitochondria swell in less than 15 minutes, apparently at the expense of the matrix. Treatment with ATP, on the other hand, produces, during the same time, a marked contraction of the isolated mitochondria, with many refoldings of the inner membrane and marked increase in the electron opacity of the matrix. It is concluded from these observations that mitochondrial swelling and contraction should be related mainly to the matrix content.

Changes in the morphology of rat liver mitochondria brought about by different methods of isolation and the concomitant changes in ATP-ase activity were studied. The morphology was investigated with the electron microscope. It was found that the ATP-ase activity of the isolated mitochondria cannot be readily correlated with the morphology of the mitochondria. The ATP-ase found in these preparations was latent, resembling the enzyme described in mitochondria prepared in 0.25 M sucrose. In confirmation of earlier results the use of 0.88 M sucrose yielded preparations with a higher initial ATP-ase than did other methods. Preparation in 0.25 M sucrose resulted in round, swollen mitochondria of which 30 to 40 per cent appeared to have lost a substantial part of the mitochondrial matrix. Preparations in 0.44 to 0.88 M sucrose contained mainly rod-shaped mitochondria plus a small amount of another type of swollen mitochondria. The matrix of mitochondria isolated in 0.88 M sucrose was highly condensed. By the use of 0.44 M sucrose adjusted to pH 6.2 with citric acid, it was possible to isolate, for the first time, mitochondria closely resembling those in situ and containing latent ATP-ase.

"In view of the unsatisfactory appearance, under the electron microscope, of liver mitochondria isolated in isotonic sucrose medium, alternative media have been examined. It was found to be advantageous to replace sucrose by raffinose, and to add levan or, preferably, dextran, together with heparin in suitable concentration. With the optimal medium, the constituents of which are raffinose, versene (optional), dextran of high molecular weight, heparin, and AMP (optional), most of the mitochondria in the osmium-fixed pellet are apparently intact, and show the membranes characteristic of mitochondria as seen in cell sections. The optimal medium has no adverse effect on the activity of the several tissue enzymes which have been studied, except that Mg++-activated ATPase is partially inhibited if the medium is present in high concentration in the assay system. Mitochondrial fractions isolated in the new medium have, in common with sucrose fractions, appreciable ""free"" ATPase activity, this activity being evidently a poor criterion of mitochondrial integrity. Use of the new medium does not decrease the proportion of cytoplasmic ATPase which fails to sediment with the mitochondria, but does give a mitochondrial fraction low in RNA and in acid phosphatase activity and little contaminated with microsomal material. Particles tentatively identified as ""lysosomes"" have been seen in certain sections."	DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED MEDIUM FOR THE ISOLATION OF LIVER MITOCHONDRIA	M. S. C. Birbeck, E.

Mitochondria isolated from rat liver and suspended in 0.44 M sucrose were disrupted by treatment with 0.3 per cent Na deoxycholate. The treated suspension was fractionated by differential centrifugation into a number of fractions and the respective pellets were examined in sections in the electron microscope. One of these fractions was found to consist of apparently membrane-bound (vesicular) elements. The difference between interfaces and membranes was discussed and the material of this fraction was found to meet stated requirements identifying it as membranous. A detailed study of the disruption process undergone by mitochondria in the presence of Na deoxycholate showed that the elements of this fraction were derived from structural elements assumed to be mitochondrial membranes. The findings thus demonstrate that mitochondria do possess membranes as defined and that these membranes can be isolated in a relatively pure form.	CYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF MITOCHONDRIA I.

In the present study a histochemical method demonstrating the activity of dehydrogenase systems was developed for electron microscopy, utilizing potassium tellurite as the hydrogen or electron acceptor. This reagent was used intravitally (intravenously, intraperitoneally, or intraluminally in hollow organs) or supravitally on small blocks of tissue for the demonstration of endogenous dehydrogenase activity. Blocks of tissue which had been frozen and thawed or which had been washed in 0.44 M sucrose to prevent endogenous activity, were used to demonstrate the activity of the succinic dehydrogenase system. In the latter case, the incubating medium contained tellurite, succinate, phosphate buffer, sucrose, and activators. The incubation was as performed either aerobically (with or without the addition of potassium cyanide) or anaerobically. The specificity and the enzymatic nature of the reactions were ascertained by appropriate control experiments. Reduced tellurite, the end product of this histochemical reaction, could be visualized in thin sections of osmium tetroxide-fixed, methacrylate-embedded tissues as crystals or fine particulate deposits of high density, localized on, or in close relationship to mitochondrial membranes. The results of these experiments are demonstrated, utilizing heart muscle (rat) as the source of the enzyme systems.

"Local anesthetics (LA) have been found to interact with phospholipids and lipids extracted from nerve and muscle. This reaction is demonstrated by: (a) Inhibition by LA of phospholipid (and tissue lipid) facilitated transport of calcium from a methanol: water phase into chloroform. This action is dependent upon the cationic form of the LA. (b) LA increase the electrical resistance of ""membranes"" prepared by impregnating Millipore filters with cephalin:cholesterol or tissue lipid extracts and bathed with NaCl or KCl solutions. (c) LA coagulate aqueous dispersions of cephalin, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and inositide, an action shared by calcium. The order of potency in coagulating cephalin sols is tetracaine > calcium > butacaine > procaine. Na+ and K+ do not coagulate phospholipid dispersions at 0.1 M concentration and antagonize the effect of Ca2+. (d) LA produce a marked fall in the pH of cephalin sols equivalent to that produced by calcium, (e) Ca2+ and LA form 1:2 molar complexes with phospholipids probably by ion-ion and ion-induced polar type of binding at the phosphate groups of the lipid. It is suggested that such reactions with cell membrane phospholipids may underlie inhibitory effects of LA on cellular ion fluxes and provide a chemical basis for anesthetic action."

After incubation of pigeon pancreas slices with P32 and isolation of various fractions by differential centrifugation the deoxycholate extract of the microsome fraction was found to account for over half of the phospholipide P and over half of the P32 incorporated into the phospholipides. The remaining phospholipide P and P32 were fairly evenly distributed in the nuclei, zymogen granules, mitochondria, microsomal ribonucleoprotein particles, and the soluble fraction. When enzyme secretion was stimulated with acetylcholine about two-thirds of the increment in radioactivity in the total phospholipides was found in deoxycholate soluble components of the microsome fraction. The remainder of the increment was distributed in the other fractions. This indicates that the cellular component in which the increase in phospholipide turnover occurs on stimulation of secretion is a membranous structure. Evidence is presented which indicates that the increment in radioactivity in the non-microsomal fractions on stimulation of secretion is due to contamination of these fractions with fragments of the stimulated membranous structure. The distribution of P32 radioactivity in each of the chromatographically separated phospholipides in the various fractions from unstimulated tissue paralleled the distribution of radioactivity in the total phospholipide fraction, indicating that individual phospholipides are not concentrated in different fractions but are associated together in the membranous structures of the microsome fraction. The major proportion of the stimulation of the turnover of the individual phospholipides also occurred in the microsome fraction. The distribution of radioactivity from glycerol-1-C14 in the total phospholipides and in the individual phospholipides in the various fractions was similar to the distribution of P32. In the microsome fraction acetylcholine stimulated the incorporation of glycerol-1-C14 in each phospholipide which showed a stimulation of P32 incorporation. The significance of the turnover of phosphatides in microsomal membranes in relation to the mechanism of secretion is discussed.

1. The distribution of DPN and DPNH pyrophosphatases and DPNase in centrifugally prepared fractions of organs of several species of animals is reported. 2. A DPNH pyrophosphatase was found in the soluble fraction of pigeon and of rabbit liver. This enzyme did not split DPN but accounted for over 50 per cent of the DPNH pyrophosphatase activity of the whole homogenates. 3. All the organs tested, including the pigeon liver and rabbit liver, contained a microsomal pyrophosphatase that attacked both DPNH and DPN. This microsomal enzyme split DPNH faster than DPN in all cases. 4. DPN pyrophosphatase and DPNase activity were generally concentrated in the microsomal fraction of liver, of kidney, and of brain. 5. The DPNase of hamster liver was virtually inactive at pH 7.5 but was optimally active at pH 5.5. Considerable difference was found with respect to pH on the activity of DPNase from organs of different animals. 6. The inhibition of mitochondrial and microsomal DPNH oxidation by nicotinamide was noted during the course of these experiments. 7. The significance of some of the distribution patterns is discussed.

1. The organic mercurial sodium mersalyl, formaldehyde, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and tributyltin each blocked respiratory-chain-linked ATP synthesis in rat liver mitochondria. 2. Mersalyl and formaldehyde also blocked a number of other processes dependent on the entry of inorganic phosphate into mitochondria, including mitochondrial respiration and swelling stimulated by cations and phosphate, the substrate-level phosphorylation reaction of the citric acid cycle, and swelling in ammonium phosphate. 3. Dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide and tributyltin did not inhibit the entry of phosphate into mitochondria. 4. Mersalyl and formaldehyde had a relatively slight effect on succinate oxidation and swelling stimulated by cations when phosphate was replaced by acetate, on succinate oxidation stimulated by uncoupling agents, and on swelling in solutions of ammonium salts other than phosphate or arsenate. 5. Formaldehyde blocked the oxidation of NAD-linked substrates in mitochondria treated with 2,4-dinitrophenol and the ATP-dependent reduction of NAD by succinate catalysed by ox heart submitochondrial particles. Both these effects appear to be due to an inhibition by formaldehyde of the NAD–flavin region of the respiratory chain. 6. Concentrations of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or tributyltin sufficient to abolish ADP-stimulated respiration blocked the dinitrophenol-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activity, whereas mersalyl and formaldehyde caused only partial inhibition of ATP hydrolysis. 7. When mitochondria were incubated with dinitrophenol and ATP, less than 10% of the total inorganic phosphate liberated was recovered in the mitochondria and no swelling occurred. In the presence of mersalyl or formaldehyde at least 80% of the total inorganic phosphate liberated was retained in the mitochondria and extensive swelling was observed. This swelling was inhibited by oligomycin but not by antimycin or rotenone. 8. The addition of mersalyl to mitochondria swollen by treatment with valinomycin, K+ and phosphate blocked the contraction induced by dinitrophenol and caused an increase in the phosphate content of the mitochondria, but had no effect on the contraction of mitochondria when phosphate was replaced by acetate. 9. It is concluded that mitochondria contain a phosphate-transporter system, which catalyses the movement of phosphate in either direction across the mitochondrial membrane, and that this system is inactivated by organic mercurials and by formaldehyde. Evidence is presented that the phosphate-transporter system is situated in the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria and is also present in other types of mammalian mitochondria.

1. The excessive accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria suspended in an iso-osmotic buffered potassium chloride medium containing oxidizable substrate and phosphate led to extensive swelling and release of accumulated Ca2+ from the mitochondria. When the Ca2+ was removed from the medium by chelation with ethylene glycol bis(aminoethyl)tetra-acetate, the swelling was reversed in a respiration-dependent contraction. The contracted mitochondria were shown to have regained some degree of respiratory control. 2. The respiration-dependent contraction could be supported by electron transport through a restricted portion of the respiratory chain, and by substrates donating electrons at different levels in the respiratory chain. 3. Respiratory inhibitors appropriate to the substrate present completely inhibited the contraction. Uncoupling agents, and the inhibitors oligomycin and atractyloside, were without effect. 4. When the reversal of swelling had been prevented by respiratory inhibitors, the addition of ATP induced a contraction of the mitochondria. In the absence of added chelating agent the contraction was very slow. The ATP-induced contraction was completely inhibited by oligomycin and atractyloside, was incomplete in the presence of uncoupling agents and was unaffected by respiratory inhibitors. 5. The relationship between the energy requirements of respiration-dependent contraction and the requirements of ion transport and other contractile systems are discussed.

1. Net movements of K+ into metabolizing liver mitochondria before and after the addition of valinomycin have been measured by using selective glass electrodes. The advantage of using an automatic titrator to hold the K+ concentration constant is demonstrated. 2. According to the energy source provided the induced movement after the addition of valinomycin can be either in or out. 3. Uptakes and rates of movement are higher in media containing acetate (20mm) than in media containing chloride (20mm). In each mixture comparisons were made at three pH values; at pH6·36 the induced rates are less than at pH7·0 or 7·8 but the final uptakes attained are increased. 4. The rate of uptake is increased by inorganic phosphate. 5. The presence of Mg2+ slightly decreases the induced uptake and rate of movement; Ca2+ can cause the induced movement of K+ to be outward. 6. The rate of induced K+ movement is related to the rate of extra oxygen consumption but with different factors in acetate (24 K+ ions/oxygen molecule) and chloride media (10 K+ ions/oxygen molecule). 7. The amount of K+ gained is proportional to the loss of fluorescence of the suspension. 8. When K+ moves there is a contrary movement of H+ but the ratio depends on the conditions. At pH6·36 in chloride media the K+/H+ ratio exceeded 10:1 and in no case did it fall to unity. 9. When K+ is taken up there is a proportional diminution of light-scattering; it is inferred that swelling takes place along with K+ accumulation. 10. It is shown by the use of tracer 42K+ that turnover of the ion in mitochondria is increased by valinomycin. 11. It is concluded that valinomycin both increases the permeability to K+ and also, given an adequate energy supply, stimulates the K+-accumulating mechanism.

1. The concentration-dependence of the intramitochondrial accumulation of l-malate and succinate was measured and expressed in the form of adsorption isotherms. The accumulation, however, may arise because of an internal positive potential. 2. The competition for accumulation offered by some other anions, including phosphate, was measured and is expressed conventionally by additional terms in the adsorption equation. 3. The interactions between anions were also studied when one was acting as oxidized substrate. 4. In some examples there is a parallel between the effects of an added anion on both accumulation and oxidation; in other cases chemical participation of the added substance in metabolism is presumed to remove the correlation. 5. It is suggested that by combining kinetic data on penetration with stoicheiometric data on accumulation and specific reaction rates it may be possible to account for the rates of respiration obtained with intact mitochondria. 6. It is possible to show that there is a certain phosphate/substrate ratio for maximum phosphorylation rate with some substrates. This is to be expected when phosphate and substrate compete for accumulation.	Intramitochondrial substrate concentration as a factor controlling metabolism. The role of interanion competition	E. J.

1. Assay conditions are described for the ATP-dependent, uncoupler-sensitive, energy-linked reduction of NAD+ by succinate, dl-α-glycerophosphate or d-lactate in membranes from aerobically grown Escherichia coli. 2. The reaction may be demonstrated in electron-transport particles (ET particles) from cells grown in glycerol, but not in depleted particles washed in low-ionic-strength buffer, or in ET particles from cells grown in glucose. 3. The latter two classes of particles have low specific activities of ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase), succinate dehydrogenase, dl-α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and d-lactate dehydrogenase relative to undepleted ET particles from cells grown in glycerol. 4. Reconstitution of energy-linked NAD+ reduction in particles from cells grown in glucose was done by: (a) addition of the high-speed supernatant fraction from sonicates of the same cells; (b) addition of a protein fraction, precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 from this supernatant, or (c) addition of an (NH4)2SO4-precipitated fraction from the low-ionic-strength wash of particles from cells grown in glycerol. 5. The use of (NH4)2SO4-precipitated fractions from ATPase- or succinate dehydrogenase-deficient mutants grown in glycerol in the above reconstitution indicated that failure to demonstrate the reaction in particles from cells grown in glucose was a result of inadequate activities of appropriate dehydrogenases, rather than of ATPase. 6. Energy-linked NAD+ reduction could be demonstrated in particles from a ubiquinone-deficient mutant only after restoration of NADH oxidase activity by adding ubiquinone-1. 7. The measured rate of the energy-linked reaction in particles from a haem-deficient mutant, however, was not stimulated after the ATP- and haematin-dependent acquisition of functional cytochromes. 8. Results are interpreted as evidence of the ubiquinone-dependent, but cytochrome-independent, nature of the site I region of the respiratory chain in E. coli.

Measurements were made of electron-transport-dependent quenching of atebrin fluorescence in particles prepared from mutants of Escherichia coli unable to synthesize either ubiquinone or haem. Such quenching was either absent (in haem-deficient particles) or decreased (in ubiquinone-deficient particles), but was restored under conditions used to reconstitute oxidase activities. It is concluded that the reconstitution of oxidase activity, in both cases, is associated with the formation of a functional, proton-translocating, respiratory chain.

1. The uptakes of Pi and serine by whole cells of mutant strains of Escherichia coli K12, grown under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, were studied. 2. Uptake by aerobic cells was low in a ubiquinone-less mutant but normal in two mutant strains unable to couple phosphorylation to electron transport. 3. One of these uncoupled strains, carrying the unc-405 allele, does not form a membrane-bound Mg2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase aggregate, and it is concluded that the Mg2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase does not serve a structural role in the aerobic active transport of Pi or serine. 4. The other uncoupled strain, in which aerobic uptake is unaffected, carries a mutation in the uncB gene, thus distinguishing this gene from the etc gene, previously shown to be concerned with the coupling of electron transport to active transport. 5. The uptakes of Pi and serine by anaerobic cells were normal in the ubiquinone-less mutant, but defective in both the uncoupled strains. 6. The uptake of Pi and serine by anaerobic cells of the uncB mutant could be increased by the addition of fumarate to the uptake medium. The unc-405 mutant, however, required the addition of fumarate for growth and for uptake. 7. The uncB mutant, unlike the unc-405 mutant, is able to grow anaerobically in a minimal medium with glucose as sole source of carbon. Similarly a strain carrying a mutation in the frd gene, which is the structural gene for the enzyme fumarate reductase, is able to grow anaerobically in a glucose-minimal medium. However, a mutant strain carrying mutations in both the uncB and frd genes resembles the unc-405 mutant in not being able to grow under these conditions.

The synthesis of nitrate reductase and its incorporation into the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli strain A1004a (5-aminolaevulinic acid auxotroph) does not require synthesis of cytochrome b. The synthesis of the apoprotein(s) of the cytochrome b of the respiratory pathway from NADH to nitrate appears to be inhibited by the absence of haem. No member of the respiratory pathway from NADH to oxygen is capable of reducing nitrate reductase directly.

Aerobic growth of Escherichia coli with an oxidizable substrate as carbon source in the presence of low concentrations of KCN leads to the synthesis and integration into the membrane of menaquinone and cytochromes b558, a1 and d in addition to the redox carriers normally present under aerobic growth conditions, namely ubiquinone and cytochromes b562, b556 and o.

The magnitudes of Yo (grams [dry weight] formed per gram of atom O) and mo, the maintenance respiration (milligram-atoms of O per gram [dry weight] per hour), of Escherichia coli B have been determined by growing the organism in aerobic continuous culture limited by a number of different substrates. The value found were as follows: glucose--tyo = 12.5, mo = 0.9; glucose plus 2.7 mM cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)--Yo = 31.2, mo = 9.3; galactose--Yo = 13.2, mo = 1.8; mannitol--Yo = 20.1, mo = 6.1; L-glutamate--Yo = 25.5, mo = 17.7; glycerol--Yo = 14.9, mo = 10.0; succinate--Yo = 11.2, mo = 12.1; and acetate--Yo = 14.7, mo = 25.4. During growth in anaerobic continuous culture with limiting glucose YATP was found to be 10.3 g (dry weight)/mol of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and m ATP was 18.9 mmol of ATP/g (dry weight) per h. The aerobic growth yields of cells growing on glucose, glucose plus cAMP, mannitol, and glutamate were consistent with the hypothesis that carbohydrates partially repress oxidative phosphorylation, but the yields of cells growing on glycerol, succinate, acetate, and galactose were all lower than expected. We conclude that, like the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, both the maintenance respiration and the amount of ATP necessary to serve maintenance processes are determined by the identity of the growth substrates. Yields smaller than expected may be explained by the absence of respiratory control exerted by phosphate acceptors.

A particulate subcellular fraction from Escherichia coli K-12 induced in anaerobic sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase can catalyze under anaerobic conditions the transfer of hydrogens from G3P to fumarate, with attendant generation of high-energy phosphate. The phsophorylation process is more sensitive than the transhydrogenation process to inhibition by the detergent Triton X-100. The same is true with respect to sensitivity to sodium azide, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Such a preparation derived from cells with beta-galactoside permease can accumulate thiomethyl beta-D-galactoside anaerobically, and the accumulation can be stimulated twofold by adding G3P and fumarate. Mutants lacking the membrane-associated Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase cannot grow anaerobically on glycerol with fumarate as the hydrogen acceptor, although they can grow aerobically on glycerol alone.	Anaerobic energy-yielding reaction associated with transhydrogenation from glycerol 3-phosphate to fumarate by an Escherichia coli system.	K Miki, E C Lin	127785	1975-12-01	19	
It is known that in Escherichia coli two dehydrogenases of the flavoprotein kind can participate in the transfer of hydrogens from sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) to nitrate and that possession of either enzyme is sufficient to permit anaerobic growth on glycerol as carbon source and nitrate as hydrogen acceptor. Results from this study show that under such a growth condition a protein with light-absorption characteristics of cytochrome b1 is induced. If G3P, nitrate, and adenosine diphosphate are added anaerobically to a particulate fraction prepared from these cells, four reactions can be detected: (i) the reduction of the cytochrome b1-like protein, (ii) the formation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), (iii) the formation of nitrite, and (iv) the generation of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). The anaerobic G3P dehydrogenase system can yield an ATP-DHAP (or ATP-nitrite) molar ratio of about 0.2, whereas the aerobic G3P dehydrogenase system can yield a corresponding ratio of about 0.3. The hydrogen transfer activity is sensitive to respiratory inhibitors such as cyanide, Rotenone, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide.

Membrane-bound nitrate reductase of Escherichia coli consists of three subunits designated as A, B, and C, with subunit C being the apoprotein of cytochrome b, A hemA mutant that cannot synthesize delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) produces a normal, stable, membrane-bound enzyme when grown with ALA. When grown without ALA, this mutant makes a reduced amount of membrane-bound enzyme that is unstable and contains no C subunit. Under the same growth conditions, this mutant accumulates a large amount of a soluble form of the enzyme in the cytoplasm. Accumulation of this cytoplasmic form begins immediately upon induction of the enzyme with nitrate. The cytoplasmic form is very similar to the soluble form of the enzyme obtained by alkaline heat extraction. It is a high-molecular-weight complex with a Strokes radius of 8.0 nm and consists of intact A and B subunits. When ALA is added to a culture growing without ALA, the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme is incorporated into the membrane in a stable form, coincident with the formation of functional cytochrome b. Reconstitution experiments indicate that subunit C is present in cultures grown without ALA but is reduced in amount or unstable. These results indicate that membrane-bound nitrate reductase is synthesized via a soluble precursor containing subunits A and B, which then binds to the membrane upon interaction with the third subunit, cytochrome b.

Growth of Escherichia coli K12 in a chemostat was limited by sulphate concentrations lower than 300 muM. The synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide and a change in morphology accompanied sulphate-limited growth. Growth yields with respect to the amount of glycerol or oxygen consumed were sixfold and twofold lower respectively under these conditions than when growth was limited by glycerol. Sulphate-limited cells lacked the proton-translocating oxidoreduction segment of the electron-transport chain between NADH and the cytochromes, and particles prepared from these cells lacked the energy-dependent reduction of NAD+ by succinate, DL-alpha-glycerophosphate or D-lactate, suggesting the loss of site-I phosphorylation. Glycerol-limited cells contained cytochrome b556, b562 and o, ubiquinone and low concentrations of menaquinone. Sulphate limitation resulted in the additional synthesis of cytochromes d, a1, b558 and c550; the amount of ubiquinone was decreased and menaquinone was barely detectable. Non-haem iron and acid-labile sulphide concentrations were twofold lower in electron-transport particles prepared from sulphate-limited cells. Recovery of site-I phosphorylation could not be demonstrated after incubating sulphate-limited cells with or without glycerol, in either the absence or presence of added sulphate. The loss of site-I phosphorylation in sulphate-limited cells is discussed with reference to the accompanying alterations in cytochrome composition of such cells. Schemes are proposed for the functional organization of the respiratory chains of E. coli grown under conditions of glycerol or sulphate limitation.

Stoicheometries and rates of proton translocation associated with respiratory reduction of NO3- have been measured for spheroplasts of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of NO3-. Observed stoicheiometries [leads to H+/NO3- ratio; P. Mitchell (1966) Chemiosmotic Coupling in Oxidative and Photosynthetic Phosphorylation, Glynn Research, Bodmin] were approx. 4 for L-malate oxidation and approx. 2 for succinate, D-lactate and glycerol oxidation. Measurements of the leads to H+/2e- ratio with formate as the reductant and oxygen or NO3- as the oxidant were complicated by pH changes associated with formate uptake and CO2 formation. Nevertheless, it was possible to conclude that the site of formate oxidation is on the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane, that the leads to H+/O ratio for formate oxidation is approx. 4, and that the leads to H+/NO3- ratio is greater than 2. Measurements of the rate of NO3- penetration into osmotically sensitive spheroplasts demonstrated an electrogenic entry of NO3- anion. The permeability coefficient for nitrate entry at 30 degrees C was between 10(-9) and 10(-10) cm- s(-1). The calculated rate of nitrate entry at the concentration typically used for the assay of nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) activity was about 0.1% of that required to support the observed rate of nitrate reduction by reduced Benzyl Viologen. Measurements of the distribution of nitrate between the intracellular and extracellular spaces of a haem-less mutant, de-repressed for nitrate reductase but unable to reduce nitrate by the respiratory chain, showed that, irrespective of the presence or the absence of added glucose, nitrate was not concentrated intracellularly. Osmotic-swelling experiments showed that the rate of diffusion of azid anion across the cytoplasmic membrane is relatively low in comparison with the fast diffusion of hydrazoic acid. The inhibitory effect of azide on nitrate reductase was not altered by treatments that modify pH gradients across the cytoplasmic membrane. It is concluded that the nitrate-reducing azide-sensitive site of nitrate reductase is located on the outer aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane. The consequences of this location for mechanisms of proton translocation driven by nitrate reduction are discussed, and lead to the proposal that the nitrate reductase of the cytoplasmic membrane is vectorial, reducing nitrate on the outer aspect of the membrane with 2H+ and 2e- that have crossed from the inner aspect of the membrane.

Measurements were made of energy-dependent quenching of atebrin fluorescence in membrane particles prepared from Escherichia coli grown anaerobically with glycerol as carbon source in the presence of either nitrate or fumarate. It is concluded that this technique can be used to study the functional organization of the anaerobic proton-translocating electron-transport chains that use nitrate or fumarate as terminal electron acceptor.

A study was made of the rapid oxidation kinetics of the cytochromes of Escherichia coli. The b-type cytochromes were kinetically heterogeneous, with one species (presumably cytochrome o) oxidized so rapidly that it could fully support observed oxidation rates. Cytochrome d but not cytochrome a1 was also kinetically competent to support respiration. However, in cells grown anaerobically in the presence of NO3-, cytochrome d exhibited slow oxidation kinetics and a red-shift in its reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum.

Studies on the respiratory nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) from Escherichia coli K12 by electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectroscopy indicate that its molybdenum centre is comparable with that in other molybdenum-containing enzymes. Two Mo(V) signals may be observed; one shows interaction of Mo(V) with a proton exchangeable with the solvent and has: A (1H) 0.9-1.2mT; g1 = 1.999; g2=1.985; g3 = 1.964; gav. = 1.983. Molybdenum of both signal-giving species may be reduced with dithionite and reoxidized with nitrate.

1. Nitrate reductase was purified 134-fold from Escherichia coli K12. The purification procedure involves the release by Triton X-100 of the enzyme from the cell envelope. i. The purified enzyme exists in aqueous solution either as a monomer (mol. wt. about 220 000) or as an associated form (probably a tetramer; mol.wt. about 880 000). 3. The purified enzyme has three subunits with apparent mol.wts. of 150 000, 67000 and 65000. An additional subunit of apparent mol.wt. 20000 is present in a haem-containing fraction that is also produced by the preparative procedure described. 4. None of the enzyme subunits is present in the cell envelope of cells grown in the absence of nitrate. 5. Reversible changes in the activity of nitrate reductase in vitro with FMNH2 as reductant can be induced under circumstances which are without effect on the reduced Benzyl Viologen-NO3-activity.ImagesPLATE 1	Purification and some properties of nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) from Escherichia coli K12.

Abram, Dinah (Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind.). Electron microscope observations on intact cells, protoplasts, and the cytoplasmic membrane of Bacillus stearothermophilus. J. Bacteriol. 89:855–873. 1965.—Negatively stained preparations of protoplasts and fragments of cytoplasmic membranes from cells of Bacillus stearothermophilus ruptured by treatment with sonic oscillation, partial lysis with lysozyme, autolysis, or phage infection were examined electron microscopically. Specimens of intact cells also were examined by the same technique. The following structural details were revealed. Intact or nearly intact, partially swollen, elongated protoplasts and their ghosts have a characteristic differentiated surface texture and can easily be distinguished from the cell wall. Infoldings of the cytoplasmic membrane can be observed in these protoplasts, to which flagella are attached; the latter originate via hooks from “basal structures” that are in close association with the cytoplasmic membrane or part of it. Abundant intracytoplasmic membranous elements, which appear to be tubular or vesicular, can be seen in whole cells of three of the strains studied. The fine structure of the cytoplasmic membrane and probably that of its intracytoplasmic infoldings was observed on flattened and folded membrane fragments, one layer thick. Structural units, roughly spherical, 65 to 85 A in diameter, were present on one side of the cytoplasmic membrane, facing the cytoplasm. They were attached loosely to the membrane by fine stalks, 40 to 60 A long, and were easily detached, probably leaving the stalks behind them on the membrane. While the greater stability of membranes from thermophiles made this study of the fine structure possible, the structural units described were demonstrated also on cytoplasmic membranes from mesophiles.Images	Electron Microscope Observations on Intact Cells, Protoplasts, and the Cytoplasmic Membrane of Bacillus stearothermophilus	Dinah Abram	14273672	1965-03-01	19	
Nitrate reductase extracted from the membrane of Escherichia coli by alkaline heat treatment was purified to homogeneity and used to prepare specific antibody. Nitrate reductase, precipitated by this antibody from Triton extracts of the membrane, contained a third subunit not present in the purified enzyme used to prepare the antibody. Nitrate reductase precipitated by antibody from alkaline heat extracts was composed of peptide fragments of various sizes. These fragments were produced by a membrane-bound protease which was activated by alkaline pH and heat. It is the action of this protease that releases the enzyme from the membrane, as shown by the observations that protease inhibitors decreased the amount of solubilization of the enzyme, and the enzyme remaining in the membrane after heating showed much less proteolytic cleavage than that which was released.

Nitrate reductase solubilized from the membrane of Escherichia coli by alkaline heat treatment was purified to homogeneity and used to prepare specific antibody. Nitrate reductase, precipitated by this antibody from Triton extracts of the membrane, contained a third subunit, not present in the purified enzyme used to prepare the antibody. This third subunit was identified as the cytochrome b1 apoprotein. This cytochrome is bound to nitrate reductase from wild-type E. coli in a ratio of 2 mol of cytochrome per mol of enzyme complex. In mutants unable to synthesize heme, this cytochrome b1 apoprotein is not bound to nitrate reductase. In these same mutants, the enzyme is overproduced and accumulates in the cytoplasm. The absence of cytochrome also affects the stability of the membrane-bound form of the enzyme.	Anaerobic cytochrome b1 in Escherichia coli: association with and regulation of nitrate reductase.

Specific antibody to purified nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli was used to identify enzyme components present in mutants which lack functional nitrate reductase. chlA and B mutants contained all three subunits present in the wild-type enzyme. Different peptides with a broad range of molecular weights could be precipitated from chlCmutants, and chlE mutants contained either slightly degraded enzyme subunits or no precipitable protein. No mutants produced significant amounts of cytoplasmic enzyme. The chlA and B loci are suggested to function in the synthesis and attachment of a molybdenum-containing factor. The chlC locus is suggested to be the structural gene for nitrate reductase subunit A and chlE is suggested to be involved in the synthesis of the cytochrome b1 apoprotein.

Azotobacter synthesizes an extensive internal membranous nework when grown with air (N2), i.e., under conditions when these bacteria fix nitrogen. Very slight quantities of internal membrane, concentrated mainly about the cell periphery, are formed when Azotobacter grows with fixed nitrogen, i.e., ammonia and amino acids. Compared to cells growing with ammonia, cells utilizing atmospheric nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source are smaller in size and volume, grow one-third slower, and lack detectable poly-β-hydroxybutyrate.Images	Correlation of Ultrastructure in Azotobacter vinelandii with Nitrogen Source for Growth	Joel Oppenheim, Leon Marcus	5411753	1970-01-01	19	
Osmotically shocked Escherichia coli and membrane vesicle ghosts from E. coli cells have lost the ability to accumulate potassium by active transport. The addition of valinomycin to the membrane ghosts restores the capacity to accumulate radioactive 42K and 86Rb by a temperature- and energy-dependent process. Membrane vesicles prepared from mutants of E. coli altered in potassium transport show defects in the valinomycin-stimulated accumulation of 42K that are related to the defects in the intact cells.

Chlorate-resistant mutants corresponding to each known genetic locus (chlA, chlB, chlC, chlD, chlE) were isolated from Escherichia coli K-12. All these mutants showed decreased amounts of membrane-bound nitrate reductase, cytochrome b, and formic dehydrogenase, but all had normal succinic dehydrogenase activity. Proteins from the cytoplasmic membranes of these mutants were compared to those of the wild type-on polyacrylamide gels. The addition of nitrate to wild-type anaerobic cultures caused increased formation of three membrane proteins. These same proteins, along with one other, were missing in varying patterns in mutants altered at the different genetic loci. One of the missing proteins was found to be the enzyme nitrate reductase, although this protein was present in some mutants lacking nitrate reductase activity. None of the others has been identified.

1. The aerobic incubation of iron-deficient Torulopsis utilis cells for 12h under non-growing conditions results in the recovery by mitochondria of the previously absent site 1 energy conservation and sensitivity to piericidin A. 2. The recovery of piericidin A sensitivity but not site 1 is prevented by the presence of cycloheximide (100μg/ml) in the medium used for aerobic incubation of the cells. Rotenone sensitivity behaved similarly. 3. Chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline were without effect on the recovery of site 1 and piericidin A sensitivity. 4. Inclusion of 59Fe in the growth medium can be used as the basis for a highly sensitive assay for non-haem iron. 5. Iron-limited growth of T. utilis lowers the concentration of both non-haem iron and acid-labile sulphide of submitochondrial particles by over 20-fold compared with the `normal' situation with iron-supplemented glycerol-limited growth. 6. Increases in the non-haem iron and acid-labile sulphide concentrations of submitochondrial particles occur when site 1 and piericidin A sensitivity are recovered. The increase is approximately halved by the presence of cycloheximide. 7. The non-haem iron of T. utilis submitochondrial particles does not exchange with added iron. 8. Continuous culture of T. utilis at the transition between glycerol- and iron-limitation results in cells where mitochondria possess site 1 energy conservation but lack piericidin A sensitivity. 8. It is concluded, in contrast with widely held views to the opposite, that energy conservation at site 1 does not require electron flow to proceed through a piericidin A- or rotenone-sensitive route. 9. Restriction of the iron supplied to growing T. utilis to a concentration just above that required for growth limitation demonstrates that a 10- to 20-fold decrease of the `normal' non-haem iron concentration of both cells and mitochondria is without effect on the growth yield per unit of carbon source. Submitochondrial particles prepared from such iron-restricted but otherwise functionally normal cells have a non-haem iron concentration of about 0.5–0.8ng-atom/mg of protein. It is concluded that the concentration of iron–sulphur protein required for normal function by the respiratory chain is close to the concentrations of cytochromes and flavoproteins.

1. Conditions have been established for the sulphate-limited growth of Torulopsis utilis in continuous culture. 2. Mitochondria prepared from sulphate-limited cells lack both piericidin A sensitivity and the first energy-conservation site (site 1). Sensitivity to antimycin A or cyanide and the second and third energy-conservation sites were apparently unaffected by sulphate-limited growth. 3. Aerobic incubation for 8h of sulphate-limited cells with a low concentration of sulphate (50μm or less) resulted in the recovery of mitochondrial piericidin A sensitivity and site 1. The use of higher concentrations of sulphate (250μm or more) still resulted in the recovery of mitochondrial piericidin A sensitivity and site 1, but also resulted in the appearance of a non-phosphorylating oxidase, which mediated oxidation of the respiratory chain at about the level of cytochrome b in an antimycin A- and cyanide-insensitive manner. Both this alternative route and the conventional normal route of respiration were shown to coexist and to intercommunicate at the level of cytochrome b. 4. Low-temperature spectroscopy failed to identify any new respiratory component to explain the alternative route. 5. The apparent affinity of the alternative route for oxygen was similar to that for the conventional route through cytochrome oxidase, namely half-maximal activity at 0.1μm-oxygen or less. 6. The non-haem iron concentration of submitochondrial particles was unaffected by sulphate limitation, whereas the acid-labile sulphide concentration was lowered tenfold. Marked increases (between four- and 30-fold) in the acid-labile sulphide concentration of submitochondrial particles were observed in sulphate-limited cells after aerobic incubation with various concentrations of sulphate. The lowest increase (fourfold) was observed without added sulphate, the highest (30-fold) with 1.0mm added sulphate. 7. The ratio of non-haem iron to acid-labile sulphide in submitochondrial particles varied with different growth conditions from a maximum of 15.0 to a minimum of 0.72. It is suggested that analytical measurements of non-haem iron are an inadequate guide to the concentration of iron–sulphur protein in complex systems. 8. The effects of sulphate-limited growth on site 1 and piericidin sensitivity are interpreted to indicate a role for iron–sulphur protein in these properties. 9. The aerobic incubation of sulphate-limited cells with cycloheximide resulted in the recovery by mitochondria of site 1 but not of piericidin sensitivity. 10. The appearance of the alternative route for cyanide- and antimycin-A (but not piericidin A-) insensitive respiration on incubating sulphate-limited cells with sulphate concentrations higher than 250μm indicates that the alternative route involves an iron–sulphur protein.

Active transport of amino acids in isolated membrane vesicles of E. coli ML 308-225 is stimulated by oxidation of D-lactate, and this stimulation is dependent on electron transport [Kaback, H. R. & Milner, L. S. (1970) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 66, 1008]. In attempting to relate these results to amino-acid transport in intact cells, we isolated mutants of E. coli ML 308-225 that contain defects in D-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.4) and electron transport. Intact cells of these mutants are normal for transport of proline and alanine. We also isolated mutants defective in Ca,Mg-stimulated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3), which is responsible for coupling electron transport to the synthesis of ATP. These mutants are defective in their ability to transport proline and alanine, as measured both in cells and isolated membrane vesicles. A possible role for the ATPase in coupling energy to active transport is discussed.	Coupling of Energy to Active Transport of Amino Acids in Escherichia coli	Robert D. Simoni, Mary K.

"Membranes obtained from Escherichia coli have been solubilized with deoxycholate. The solubilized dehydrogenases and cytochromes are not sedimented at 105,000 g. These components readily penetrate the ""included space"" of Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and polyacrylamide gels and have been fractionated on the basis of molecular size. Solubilization destroys nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH) oxidase and D-lactate oxidase activities, but leaves an appreciable part of the original succinoxidase activity intact. Evidence for a succinate dehydrogenase-cytochrome b1 complex is given. Menadione added to the solubilized preparation does not elicit NADH oxidase activity nor stimulate the existing succinoxidase activity, but does provoke an active D-lactate oxidase activity. This D-lactate oxidase activity, however, does not use cytochromes and is not sensitive to cyanide."	RESPIRATION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN ESCHERICHIA COLI MEMBRANE-ENVELOPE FRAGMENTS VI.

Two classes of mutants isolated from E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium are altered in respiration-coupled active transport, as studied in whole cells and/or isolated membrane vesicles. Mutant cells defective in D-lactate dehydrogenase (dld) transport amino acids and lactose normally. Membrane vesicles prepared from these mutants do not exhibit D-lactate-dependent transport, D-lactate oxidation, or D-lactate: dichlorophenolindophenol reductase activity. However, succinate-dependent transport is markedly enhanced in these mutants, without a corresponding increase in succinic dehydrogenase activity.The second class of mutants is defective in the coupling of electron transfer to active transport. Whole cells and membrane vesicles prepared from these etc mutants exhibit markedly reduced ability to transport amino acids, despite the ability of the vesicles to oxidize D-lactate, succinate, and NADH. Vectorial phosphorylation of α-methylglucoside by these mutants is normal. Electrontransfer coupling mutants are similar phenotypically to mutants uncoupled for oxidative phosphorylation (uncA), but have normal ATPase activity. Moreover, uncA mutants catalyze active transport as well as does the wild type. These experiments indicate that the ETC component is essential for the coupling of respiratory energy to active transport, and provide further evidence that the generation or utilization of ATP is not involved in these transport mechanisms.

The membrane adenosine triphosphatase (E.C. 3.6.1.3) from Escherichia coli has been solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 12.9S in a sucrose gradient, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 360,000. On electrophoresis in gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, it dissociates into subunits with apparent molecular weights of 60,000, 56,000, 35,000, and 13,000. The purified enzyme loses activity and breaks down into subunits when stored in the cold. Guanosine 5′-triphosphate and inosine 5′-triphosphate are alternative substrates. Ca2+ and, to a small extent, Co2+ or Ni2+ will substitute for Mg2+ in the reaction. The Km for Mg-adenosine triphosphate of the membrane-bound enzyme is 0.23 mM, and for the pure enzyme it is 0.29 mM. Azide is a noncompetitive inhibitor of both the membrane-bound enzyme and the pure enzyme. Pi is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the solubilized enzyme. An antibody to the purified enzyme was obtained from rabbits. The antibody inhibits the solubilized enzyme and virtually all of the adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by membranes from cells grown aerobically or anaerobically. The antibody also inhibits the adenosine triphosphate-stimulated pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (E.C. 1.6.1.1) of the E. coli membrane.Images	Energy-Transducing Adenosine Triphosphatase from Escherichia coli: Purification, Properties, and Inhibition by Antibody	Ronald L.

The reconstitution of nitrate reductase activity in mixtures of cytoplasmic fractions from the chlorate-resistant mutants chlA, B, C, and E which are lacking this activity was investigated, and the membrane-like particulate material which formed during this reconstitution was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When chlA and chlB extracts are incubated together, the cytoplasmic membrane proteins present in the particles which are formed are contributed by both mutants, and the proteins are essentially the same as the proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane fractions of the two mutants. Identical amounts of protein become particulate when cytoplasmic extracts of any of the mutant strains or wild-type strains are incubated at 32 C either singly or in mixtures, and the formation of particulate material does not appear to be a consequence of nitrate reductase reconstitution. Experiments with wild-type strains indicate that the membrane proteins in the cytoplasmic extract are derived from the cytoplasmic membrane during cell breakage. Reconstitution experiments involving various combinations of preincubated and unincubated extracts of the mutants have allowed a preliminary identification of three types of components which are necessary for the formation of active nitrate reductase: (i) a soluble factor present only in extracts from induced chlB; (ii) a different soluble factor which is missing in chlB but is present in extracts from wild-type, chlA, chlC, and chlE; and (iii) a complex including the nitrate reductase protein which is inactivated by preincubation of the mutant extracts.

1. The NAD(P) transhydrogenase activity of the soluble fraction of sonicated rat liver mitochondrial preparations was greater than the NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, and the NAD-linked and NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase activities were not additive. The NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was destroyed by an endogenous autolytic system or by added nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and was restored by a catalytic amount of NADP. 2. We concluded that the isocitrate dehydrogenase of rat liver mitochondria was exclusively NADP-specific, and that the oxoglutarate/isocitrate couple could therefore be used unequivocally as redox reactant for NADP in experiments designed to operate only the NAD(P) transhydrogenase (or loop 0) segment of the respiratory chain in intact mitochondria. 3. During oxidation of isocitrate by acetoacetate in intact, anaerobic, mitochondria via the rhein-sensitive, but rotenone- and arsenite-insensitive, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, measurements of the rates of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-insensitive pH change in the presence of various oxoglutarate/isocitrate concentration ratios gave an →H+/2e− quotient of 1.94±0.12 for outward proton translocation by the NAD(P) transhydrogenase. 4. Measurements with a K+-sensitive electrode confirmed that the electrogenicity of the NAD(P) transhydrogenase reaction corresponded to the translocation of one positive charge per acid equivalent. 5. Sluggish reversal of the NAD(P) transhydrogenase reaction resulted in a significant inward proton translocation. 6. The possibility that isocitrate might normally be oxidized via loop 0 at a redox potential of −450mV, or even more negative, is discussed, and implies that a P/O quotient of 4 for isocitrate oxidation might be expected.

A neomycin-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli, NR70, lacking membrane-bound Mg2+-adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity has been isolated. Both whole cells and membrane vesicles exhibit a reduced ability to accumulate amino acids and sugars. Other membrane-related functions such as oxygen consumption, the in vivo hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, and the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system did not exhibit reduced activities in NR70. Amino acid transport could be partially restored by the addition of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The results suggest that a role of the Mg2+-adenosine triphosphatase may be to participate in the coupling of energy derived from the electron transport chain to other processes such as transport.

1. Membrane preparations from both uncA− and uncB− mutant strains of Escherichia coli K12, in which electron transport is uncoupled from phosphorylation, were fractionated by washing with a low-ionic-strength buffer. The fractionation gave a `5mm-Tris wash' and a `membrane residue' from each strain. This technique, applied to membranes from normal cells, separates the Mg2+,Ca2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activity from the membrane-bound electron-transport chain and the non-energy-linked transhydrogenase activity. 2. Reconstitution of both oxidative phosphorylation and the ATP-dependent transhydrogenase activity was obtained by a combination of the `membrane residue' from strain AN249 (uncA−) with the `5mm-Tris wash' from strain AN283 (uncB−). 3. Valinomycin plus NH4+ inhibited oxidative phosphorylation both in membranes from a normal strain of E. coli and in the reconstituted membrane system derived from the mutant strains. 4. The electron-transport-dependent transhydrogenase activity was located in the membrane residue and was de-repressed in both the mutant strains. 5. The spatial and functional relationships between the proteins specified by the uncA and uncB genes and the transhydrogenase protein are discussed.

Measurements were made of the stoicheiometry of respiration-driven proton translocation coupled to the oxidation of NAD(P)-linked or flavin-linked substrates in intact cells of Escherichia coli. Observed stoicheiometries (→H+/O quotient; Mitchell, 1966) were approx. 4 with l-malate as substrate and approx. 2 for succinate, d-lactate and glycerol oxidation. It is concluded that the potential number of equivalent energy-conservation sites associated with the respiratory chain is 2 in aerobically grown cells of E. coli harvested during the exponential phase of growth.

The application of freeze-cleave electron microscopy to whole cells of Escherichia coli revealed that the particles exposed on the resulting two inner membrane faces are asymmetrically distributed. This method can therefore be used to determine the orientation of membrane vesicles from E. coli. Membrane vesicles freshly prepared in potassium phosphate buffer (K+-vesicles) by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts consisted almost entirely of right-side-out vesicles. Their size suggested that each cell gives rise to one vesicle. When the membrane vesicles were subjected to one cycle of freezing and thawing, the number of inside-out vesicles rose to about 25%. However, due to the small size of most of the inside-out vesicles, these contribute only 2 to 3% of the total membrane surface area of the preparation. The inside-out vesicles appear to arise from infoldings of the membrane of right-side-out vesicles. They also accumulate within the latter, thus producing multivesicular membrane sacs. Na+-vesicles (vesicles prepared in sodium phosphate buffer) subjected to freezing and thawing appeared to lose structural rigidity more than did K+-vesicles. In contrast to the membrane vesicles prepared by the osmotic lysis of spheroplasts, those obtained by breaking intact cells by a single passage through a French pressure cell were uniformly very small (only 40 to 110 nm in diameter); approximately 60 to 80% were inside-out. To reconcile the polarity of the membrane vesicles with the enzymic activities of such preparations, we propose that “dislocation” of membrane proteins occurs during osmotic lysis of spheroplasts.Images	Orientation of Membrane Vesicles from Escherichia coli as Detected by Freeze-Cleave Electron Microscopy	K.

The inner or cytoplasmic membrane fraction of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli was isolated by isopycnic centrifugation on sucrose gradients. The membrane proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (8.5%), and up to 56 bands were resolved. Different preparations gave very similar patterns of proteins. Succinate dehydrogenase mutants (sdh) were isolated which could not grow on succinate minimal medium, although growth on fumarate was unimpaired. The protein patterns of inner membrane preparations from sdh amber mutants were compared with the wild type, and one major band was greatly reduced in the mutants. This component, which represented approximately 5% of the inner membrane protein, was restored by introducing an amber suppressor gene (supU), which also restored the Sdh+ phenotype. The band corresponded to a protein with a molecular weight of 67,000 daltons, which is close to that for the large subunits of the succinate dehydrogenases of Rhodospirillum rubrum and beef heart mitochondria.Images	Proteins of the Inner Membrane of Escherichia coli: Identification of Succinate Dehydrogenase by Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis with sdh Amber Mutants	Margaret E.

1. The reconstitution of oxidase activity in cell-free extracts of a mutant of Escherichia coli K12Ymel, that require 5-aminolaevulinic acid for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, is described. 2. The reconstitution is dependent on haematin or a haem extract from a prototrophic strain of E. coli, and the product of the reaction has been identified as NADH-reducible cytochrome b. 3. The requirement for haematin cannot be replaced by four other porphyrins. Coproporphyrin III does not inhibit the haematin-dependent reconstitution, mesoporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX apparently compete with haematin for a binding site on the cytochrome apoprotein(s) and deuteroporphyrin IX binds to cytochrome apoprotein(s) and cannot be subsequently replaced by haematin. 4. The properties of electron-transport particles from cell-free extracts of the mutant strain, grown aerobically in the presence or absence of 5-aminolaevulinic acid, are described. In the absence of 5-aminolaevulinic acid no detectable cytochromes are produced, and oxidase activities are lowered but there is no apparent effect on the activities of the NADH dehydrogenase and d-lactate dehydrogenase. 5. The reconstitution of oxidase activity by electron-transport particles from cells grown in the absence of 5-aminolaevulinic acid requires ATP and haematin, and the product of the reaction was identified as NADH-reducible cytochrome b. 6. It is concluded that the cytochrome apoproteins are synthesized and incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli in the absence of haem synthesis. The subsequent reconstitution of functional cytochrome(s) requires protohaem, but the nature of the side chain on the 2 and 4 positions of the porphyrin appears to be important.

1. A new mutant strain (AN228) of Escherichia coli K12, unable to couple phosphorylation to electron transport, has been isolated. The mutant allele (unc-405), in strain AN228, was found to map near the uncA and uncB genes at about minute 74 on the E. coli genome. 2. A transductant strain (AN285) carrying the unc-405 allele is similar to the uncA and uncB mutants described previously in that it is unable to grow on succinate, gives a low aerobic yield on limiting concentrations of glucose, has a normal rate of electron transport, is unable to couple phosphorylation to electron transport, and lacks ATP-dependent transhydrogenase activity. 3. Strain AN285 (unc-405) is similar to an uncA mutant, but different from an uncB mutant, in that it is unable to grow anaerobically in a glucose–mineral-salts medium, and membrane preparations do not have Mg2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activity. 4. Strain AN285 (unc-405) does not form an aggregate analogous to the membrane-bound Mg2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase aggregate found in normal cells. In this respect it differs from strain AN249 (uncA−), which forms an inactive membrane-bound Mg2+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase aggregate.	Oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli K12.

The energy-transducing, Mg-Ca activated ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) of E. coli is located on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Antibody to purified ATPase has now been used to demonstrate that membrane vesicles as ordinarily prepared by the lysozyme-EDTA method consist of two distinct populations. About half the vesicles are everted, and thus readily agglutinated by antibody to ATPase, while half are right-side out. NADH oxidase (reduced NAD:O2 oxidoreductase EC 1.6.99.3) activity is associated almost entirely with everted vesicles, while the ability to concentrate proline is a property of the right-side out vesicles. The results explain the failure of previous workers to observe the energization of membrane vesicles by oxidation of NADH.

In anaerobic suspensions of Escherichia coli, after H+ ions have been translocated outwards across the plasma membrane by a respiratory pulse, re-equilibration is catalysed by Na+. The sudden addition of a Na+ salt causes the effective outward translocation of H+ by an electroneutral process. We conclude that the plasma membrane of E. coli contains a Na+/H+ antiport system that normally translocates Na+ outwards under the influence of an inwardly directed H+-activity gradient.

1. The mechanism of sulphite and sulphate permeation into rat liver mitochondria was investigated. 2. Extramitochondrial sulphite and sulphate elicit efflux of intramitochondrial phosphate, malate, succinate and malonate. The sulphate-dependent effluxes and the sulphite-dependent efflux of dicarboxylate anions are inhibited by butylmalonate, phenylsuccinate and mersalyl. Inhibition of the phosphate efflux produced by sulphite is caused by mersalyl alone and by N-ethylmaleimide and butylmalonate when present together. 3. External sulphite and sulphate cause efflux of intramitochondrial sulphate, and this is inhibited by butylmalonate, phenylsuccinate and mersalyl. 4. External sulphite and sulphate do not cause efflux of oxoglutarate or citrate. 5. Mitochondria swell when suspended in an iso-osmotic solution of ammonium sulphite; this is not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide or mersalyl. 6. Low concentrations of sulphite, but not sulphate, produce mitochondrial swelling in iso-osmotic solutions of ammonium malate, succinate, malonate, sulphate, or phosphate in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide. 7. It is concluded that both sulphite and sulphate may be transported by the dicarboxylate carrier of rat liver mitochondria and also that sulphite may permeate by an additional mechanism; the latter may involve the permeation of sulphurous acid or SO2 or an exchange of the sulphite anion for hydroxyl ion(s).

When cells of Pseudomonas are grown on citrate as the sole carbon source they oxidize citrate and isocitrate rapidly. Fluorocitrate inhibits the oxidation of citrate. Fluorocitrate-treated cells accumulate [6-14C]citrate, as shown by a rapid Millipore-filtration technique. In the absence of fluorocitrate most of the [6-14C]-citrate is lost in the form of 14CO2. The isolation of a pseudomonad characterized by its ability to grow on tricarballylate as a sole carbon source has facilitated the study of the tricarboxylate-carrier specificity. Cells grown on citrate will exchange radioactive citrate for unlabelled citrate or isocitrate but not for cis-aconitate, trans-aconitate or tricarballylate. Cells grown on tricarballylate will exchange radioactive citrate for unlabelled citrate, cis-aconitate or tricarballylate, but not for isocitrate or trans-aconitate. The properties of the exchange system involved are compared with those of the related system in mitochondria.	The transport of citrate and other tricarboxylic acids in two species of Pseudomonas	H.

When cells of the anaerobe Streptococcus lactis 7962 are deprived of their normal fermentable energy source, active transport of galactosides is completely abolished although the membrane carriers are still capable of facilitating the equilibration of sugars across the cell membrane. In these nonmetabolizing cells it was possible to test the Mitchell hypothesis of obligatory coupling of proton movement with sugar transport. This hypothesis was supported by alkalinization of the medium observed when thiomethylgalactoside was added to a lightly buffered suspension of S. lactis cells. Conversely, addition of protons resulted in active transport of thiomethylgalactoside. Accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside to a concentration more than 20-times that in the external medium was induced by suddenly exposing cells to a medium at pH 6; no accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside was observed with cells exposed to pH 8.Active transport of thiomethylgalactoside occurred in the absence of energy metabolism when S. lactis cells were treated with valinomycin. This ionophore allowed intracellular K+ to flow out, thus imposing a membrane potential (inside negative). This potential resulted in a proton uptake and an associated active transport of galactoside. The membrane potential was measured from the distribution ratio (inside/outside) of K+ in the presence of valinomycin. The pH gradient was measured from the distribution ratio of [14C]methylamine. The protonmotive force, calculated from the membrane potential and the pH gradient, was found to be directly related to the accumulation of galactoside, in accordance with the chemiosmotic hypothesis.

Solubilization of a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-2,6 dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) oxidoreductase associated with the membrane NADH oxidase system of Bacillus megaterium KM was effected by treatment with 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 8 m urea, or buffer (pH 9.0) in the presence of ethyl-enediaminetetraacetate. These treatments inactivated membrane NADH oxidase. It was found that membrane NADH oxidase and NADH-DCIP oxidoreductase were masked in membranes. Several procedures, including brief sonic oscillation, treatment with 0.05% deoxycholate, prolonged stirring at 4 C with 10% glycerol, and washing in the absence of Mg2+, unmasked the oxidase and oxidoreductase activities. It was necessary to study the masking and unmasking of these activities to quantitate adequately the effects of solubilization procedures. Further information on the localization of oxidase and oxidoreductase in subcellular fractions and the effects of electron transport inhibitors on NADH oxidation was also obtained.Images	Masking of Bacillus megaterium KM Membrane Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Oxidase and Solubilization Studies1	R.

A fluorescent galactoside, 2-(N-dansyl)-aminoethyl β-D-thiogalactoside (dansyl-galactoside), competitively inhibits lactose transport by membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli, but is not actively transported. An increase in dansyl-galactoside fluorescence is observed upon addition of D-lactate. The fluorescence increase is not observed in membrane vesicles lacking the β-galactoside transport system, and is blocked or rapidly reversed by addition of β-galactosides, sulfhydryl reagents, inhibitors of D-lactate oxidation, or uncoupling agents. The fluorescence increase exhibits an emission maximum at 500 nm and excitation maxima at 345 nm and at 292 nm. The latter excitation maximum is absent unless D-lactate is added, indicating that the bound dansyl-galactoside molecules are excited by energy transfer from the membrane proteins. Titration of vesicles with dansyl-galactoside in the presence of D-lactate demonstrates that the β-galactoside carrier protein represents about 3.3% of the total membrane protein. The data indicate that D-lactate oxidation leads to binding of the fluorescent galactoside to the β-galactoside carrier protein in such a manner that the dansyl group is transferred to a hydrophobic environment within the membrane.

Membrane vesicles containing internal alcohol dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) were prepared from Escherichia coli ML308-225. Upon the addition of ethanol, these vesicles respired and transported several amino acids. Transport rates driven by internally generated reduced NAD (NADH) were about 60 to 80% of that stimulated by d-lactate. This transport was inhibited by cyanide and anaerobiosis. Ferricyanide, a nonpermeable electron acceptor, inhibited transport stimulated by external NADH, but not that stimulated by internally generated NADH.

Accumulation of 45Ca++ was found to occur in membrane vesicles of E. coli prepared by lysis with a French pressure cell. The uptake occurs by active transport, requiring an energy source. Substrates of the electron transport chain, including D-lactate, reduced phenazine methosulfate, and NADH, stimulated accumulation, but this effect was blocked by the addition of cyanide. ATP could also stimulate accumulation, and this effect was blocked by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation inhibited the accumulation driven by either type of energy source.Accumulation of calcium is rapid, reaching the steady-state plateau within 1 min. Addition of phosphate to the assay buffer results in a prolongation of the reaction, allowing for the time-dependent accumulation of calcium for as long as 30 min.Vesicles prepared by lysis with a French pressure cell exhibit almost no ability to accumulate proline, while vesicles prepared by the method of Kaback transport proline but exhibit little energy-dependent transport of calcium. It is suggested that the accumulation of calcium in these vesicles, which are believed to be inverted, reflects a system that in vivo is responsible for the active extrusion of calcium from the cells.

1. The action of the antibiotics enniatin A, valinomycin, the actin homologues, gramicidin, nigericin and dianemycin on mitochondria, erythrocytes and smectic mesophases of lecithin–dicetyl hydrogen phosphate was studied. 2. These antibiotics induced permeability to alkali-metal cations on all three membrane systems. 3. The ion specificity on each membrane system was the same. 4. Enniatin A, valinomycin and the actins did not induce permeability to protons, whereas nigericin and dianemycin rendered all three membrane systems freely permeable to protons. 5. Several differences were noted between permeability induced by nigericin and that induced by gramicidin. 6. The action of all these antibiotics on mitochondrial respiration could be accounted for by changes in passive ion permeability of the mitochondrial membrane similar to those induced in erythrocytes and phospholipid membranes, if it is assumed that a membrane potential is present in respiring mitochondria.

1. Total water exchangeable with tritiated water and sucrose space were measured in rat liver mitochondria during the uptake of K+ induced by valinomycin and the release caused by nigericin. The K+ content and the sucrose-inaccessible water rose and fell together. 2. Swelling resulting from phosphate addition in a medium of high K+ concentration was associated mainly with increased sucrose-accessible water, which carried dissolved K+. This change was reversed by addition of ATP. 3. The response of the sucrose-inaccessible space to changed osmolarity was qualitatively that expected if the mitochondrial K+ is assumed to be present in this space with a univalent anion. 4. It is brought out that the light-scattering method fails to distinguish between changes in sucrose space and in sucrose-inaccessible space, which in the present experiments could be altered respectively by phosphate (in high K+ solution) and by cation uptake induced by antibiotic.

1. The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the lactate-, β-hydroxybutyrate- and glutamate-dehydrogenase systems were measured in rat livers freeze-clamped as soon as possible after death. The substrates of these dehydrogenases are likely to be in equilibrium with free NAD+ and NADH, and the ratio of the free dinucleotides can be calculated from the measured concentrations of the substrates and the equilibrium constants (Holzer, Schultz & Lynen, 1956; Bücher & Klingenberg, 1958). The lactate-dehydrogenase system reflects the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio in the cytoplasm, the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial cristae and the glutamate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial matrix. 2. The equilibrium constants of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were redetermined for near-physiological conditions (38°; I0·25). 3. The mean [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio of rat-liver cytoplasm was calculated as 725 (pH7·0) in well-fed rats, 528 in starved rats and 208 in alloxan-diabetic rats. 4. The [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio for the mitochondrial matrix and cristae gave virtually identical values in the same metabolic state. This indicates that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase share a common pool of dinucleotide. 5. The mean [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio within the liver mitochondria of well-fed rats was about 8. It fell to about 5 in starvation and rose to about 10 in alloxan-diabetes. 6. The [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios of cytoplasm and mitochondria are thus greatly different and do not necessarily move in parallel when the metabolic state of the liver changes. 7. The ratios found for the free dinucleotides differ greatly from those recorded for the total dinucleotides because much more NADH than NAD+ is protein-bound. 8. The bearing of these findings on various problems, including the following, is discussed: the number of NAD+–NADH pools in liver cells; the applicability of the method to tissues other than liver; the transhydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; the physiological significance of the difference of the redox states of mitochondria and cytoplasm; aspects of the regulation of the redox state of cell compartments; the steady-state concentration of mitochondrial oxaloacetate; the relations between the redox state of cell compartments and ketosis.

1. The rates of formation of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate by the isolated perfused rat liver were measured under various conditions. 2. The rates found after addition of butyrate, octanoate, oleate and linoleate were about 100μmoles/hr./g. wet wt. in the liver of starved rats. These rates are much higher than those found with rat liver slices. 3. The differences between the rates given by slices and by the perfused organ were much higher with the long-chain than with short-chain fatty acids. The increments caused by oleate and linoleate were 12 and 16 times as large in the perfused organ as in the slices, whereas the increments caused by butyrate and octanoate were about four times as large. 4. The rates of ketogenesis in the unsupplemented perfused liver of well-fed rats, and the increments caused by the addition of fatty acids, were about half of those in the liver from starved rats. 5. The value of the [β-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio of the medium was raised by octanoate, oleate and linoleate. 6. Carnitine did not significantly accelerate ketogenesis from fatty acids. 7. Oleate formed up to 82% of the expected yield of ketone bodies. 8. In the liver of alloxan-diabetic rats the endogenous rates of ketogenesis were raised, in some cases as high as in the liver from starved rats, after addition of oleate. 9. On addition of either β-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate to the perfusion medium the liver gradually adjusted the [β-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio towards the normal range. 10. The [β-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio of the medium was about 0·4 when slices were incubated, but near the physiological value of 2 when the liver was perfused. 11. The experiments demonstrate that for the study of ketogenesis slices are in many ways grossly inferior to the perfused liver.	Rates of ketone-body formation in the perfused rat liver	H. A.

1. The ratio [ATP]/[ADP][Pi], as measured by direct determination of the three components in rat liver, was found in various nutritional states to have approximately the same value as the ratio [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] calculated from the concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glyceraldehyde phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate on the assumption that lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase are at near-equilibrium in the liver. This implies that the redox state of the NAD couple in the cytoplasm is linked to, and partially controlled by, the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides. 2. The combined equilibrium constant of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase reactions at 38°C and I0.25, was found to be 5.9×10−6. 3. The fall of the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio in starvation and other situations is taken to be the consequence of a primary fall of the [ATP]/[ADP][HPO42−] ratio.

1. A study has been made of the ability of rat liver in vivo to maintain equilibrium in the combined glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions, i.e. in the system: [Formula: see text] Attempts were made to upset equilibrium. The [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio was rapidly changed by injection of ethanol or crotyl alcohol, and the value of [ATP]/[ADP][HPO42−] was rapidly changed by injection of ethionine or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone. 2. The concentrations of the metabolites occurring in the above equation were measured in freeze-clamped liver. 3. Although the injected agents caused large changes in the concentrations of the individual components, near-equilibrium in the system was maintained, as indicated by the fact that the value of [ATP]/[ADP][HPO42−], referred to as the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides, measured directly agreed with the value calculated for equilibrium conditions from the above equation. 4. The results are discussed and taken to confirm that the order of magnitude of the value of the redox state of the cytoplasmic NAD couple in rat liver is controlled by the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotide system.

1. The interaction of electron-transporting particles from heavy mitochondria of ox heart with several fluorescent probes was examined. 2. 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate and 2-(N-methylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulphonate both show an energy-dependent response. 3. Energy transfer between the electron-transporting particles and the dyes and the kinetics of the dye–particle interaction were studied in order to locate the binding regions in the membrane. 4. The energy-dependent probe responses were shown to be a result of changes in the quantum yield of fluorescence of the bound dyes together with increased binding of the dyes to the energized membrane. 5. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were also used to observe changes on energization. 6. A new type of probe was found in pyrene-3-sulphonate, which may be regarded as a `volume indicator' for the internal membrane binding region, since it shows a concentration-dependent excimer fluorescence. 7. By comparing the responses of all these dyes when energized particles are uncoupled, a membrane transition with a time-constant of 2–3s is inferred.

Isolated mitochondria are capable of undergoing dramatic reversible ultrastructural transformations between a condensed and an orthodox conformation. These two conformations are the extremes in ultrastructural organization between which structually and functionally intact mitochondria transform during reversible respiratory cycles. It has been found that electron transport is required for the condensed-to-orthodox ultrastructural transformation which occurs in mitochondria under State IV conditions, i.e., under conditions in which exogenous substrate is present and ADP is deficient. Inhibition of State IV electron transport at the cyanide-, antimycin A-, or Amytal-sensitive sites in the respiratory chain results in inhibition of this transformation. Resumption of electron transport in initially inhibited mitochondrial systems, initiated by channeling electrons through pathways which bypass the inhibited sites, results in resumption of the ultrastructural transformation. The condensed-to-orthodox transformation is DNP insensitive and, therefore, does not require participation of the coupling enzymes of the energy-transfer pathway. It is concluded that this ultrastructural transformation is manifest by the conversion of the chemical energy of electron transport directly into mechanical work. The reversed ultrastructural transformation, i.e., orthodox-to-condensed, which occurs during ADP-activated State III electron transport, is inhibited by DNP and parallels suppression of acceptor control and oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanochemical ultrastructural transformation as a basis for energy transfer in mitochondria is considered with respect to the results presented.

"Electron-opaque granules are deposited in isolated rat-liver mitochondria concomitant with the energy-linked accumulation of Sr++ by these organelles. High temperature microincineration (600°C) of thin sections of mitochondria containing different amounts of Sr++ shows that a clear qualitative correlation exists between the number of inorganic residues remaining after incineration and the amount of Sr++ translocated into the mitochondria. By loading the mitochondria with consecutive pulses of small amounts of Sr++ (""multiple-pulse"" loading), very early stages of granule formation can be detected; the first detectable deposits are seen closely associated with the cristae. The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that mineral deposition following or during the in vitro accumulation of ions by mitochondria occurs, at least initially, at sites on these membranes and not as nonspecific precipitates in the mitochondrial matrix. The large number of electron-opaque deposits (100 to 200) seen in single thin sections of individual mitochondria having accumulated intermediate levels of Sr++ clearly exceeds the number of normal dense granules in rat-liver mitochondria, indicating that the normal matrix granules per se do not constitute sites essential for deposition. At the highest levels of Sr++ uptake studied in the multiple-pulse loading experiments, needlelike deposits are seen, a result which suggests that the structural form (""crystallinity"") of the mineral deposits may be determined by the rate of accumulation."

The intracellular distribution of calcium has been studied in the mucosa of the avian shell gland, a tissue which transports large quantities of calcium during discrete time intervals. Ca45 was administered to hens either in a single dose followed by sacrifice 5 min later or in repeated doses over an extended period followed by sacrifice 2 hr or 24 hr after the last injection. Subcellular fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed for Ca45. The Ca45 was located principally in the particulate fractions; the concentration (CPM Ca45/mg N) was highest in the mitochondrial fraction. Comparisons of (1) the Ca45 distribution in shell gland cells with that of liver cells, (2) the alterations which occur due to the phase of the egg laying cycle, (3) the effects due to the time elapsed since the last injection of Ca45, and (4) the Ca45 distribution of the short term experiments with that of the long term experiments revealed that the mitochondrial fraction of the shell gland appeared to be active in the movement of calcium. The microsomal fraction showed increased values in CPM Ca45/mg N when calcification was occurring, which may indicate that the subcellular components of this fraction have a role in calcium transport. The nuclear and supernatant fractions did not seem to be involved in the transport process. The implications of these results concerning the manner by which calcium may be controlled on a cellular level in this system are discussed.

Isolated rat liver mitochondria were incubated in vitro under conditions supporting the massive accumulation of calcium and phosphate. Samples were embedded, thin sectioned, and examined in the electron microscope. The intramitochondrial distribution of insoluble or structure-bound mineral substances was studied by electron microscopy coupled with recently developed techniques of high resolution microincineration. As shown previously, the ion-loaded mitochondria acquire large, internal granules which have inherent electron opacity indicative of high mineral content. Study of ash patterns in preselected areas of sections directly confirmed the high mineral content of the granules, and the appearance of the residues was consistent with the copresence in the granules of some organic material. Other mitochondrial structures were almost devoid of mineral. Thin sections of unincubated control mitochondria also were incinerated. They were found to contain appreciable amounts of intrinsic mineral, seemingly associated with membranes. The normal, dense matrix granules commonly seen in unaltered mitochondria could be seen in intact sections of these control preparations, but after burning no definite correspondence of any ash to the granules could be demonstrated. The normal granules perhaps do not contain mineral. Heating experiments on ash patterns of all the preparations demonstrated the thermal stability and crystallizability of the ash. The crystallized ash of the in vitro-produced dense granules was tentatively shown by electron diffraction to be β-tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite). This, together with evidence from the literature, suggests that the original, noncrystalline mineral may be a colloidal, subcrystalline precursor of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite. Experiments were performed on synthetic calcium phosphates for comparison. Other possible applications of the microincineration techniques are briefly discussed.

The energized uptake of low levels of Ca2+ in the presence and absence of phosphate by isolated rat liver mitochondria, and the perturbation effected by this activity on ultrastructural and metabolic parameters of mitochondria have been investigated. In the presence of phosphate, low levels of Ca2+ are taken up by mitochondria and result in various degrees of ultrastructural expansion of the inner mitochondrial compartment. This indicates that low levels of Ca2+ in the presence of phosphate, are accumulated in an osmotically active form into the water phase of the inner compartment. The first clearly observable quantitative increase in the volume of the inner compartment occurs after the accumulation of 100 nmoles Ca2+/mg protein. An accumulation of 150–200 nmoles Ca2+/mg protein, which is equivalent to the osmolar concentration of endogenous K+, is required to effect a doubling of the volume of the inner compartment. This degree of osmotic perturbation occurs as mitochondria transform from a condensed to an orthodox conformation. The osmotically induced orthodox conformation differs from the mechanochemically induced orthodox conformation previously described, in that its development is concomitant with a marked decrease in acceptor control and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and it fails to transform to a condensed conformation in response to addition of ADP. In the absence of added phosphate, a maximum of 190 nmoles Ca2+/mg protein was found to be taken up by mitochondria (state 6). Ca2+ is apparently bound under state 6 conditions since the uptake does not effect an ultrastructural expansion of the inner compartment. Phosphate added after state 6 Ca2+ binding, however, results in an immediate ultrastructural expansion of the inner compartment. The addition of phosphate to mitochondria in the absence of exogenous Ca2- fails to effect an osmotic ultrastructural transformation. Under state 6 conditions, the binding of between 40 and 190 nmoles Ca2+/mg protein results in the formation of dense matrix inclusions which appear to be composed of tightly packed, concentrically oriented membranes. Under conditions in which the bound Ca2+ is subsequently released, there is a concomitant loss in the density of these matrix inclusions, leaving behind morphologically distinct membrane whorls in the mitochondrial matrix.

Membrane-bound, flavin-linked D-lactate dehydrogenase in membrane vesicles of E. coli ML 308-225 is solubilized by extraction with guanidine HCl. When membrane vesicles prepared from a D-lactate dehydrogenase mutant are treated with this extract, they regain the capacity to catalyze D-lactate oxidation and D-lactate-dependent transport. Similar effects are obtained with wild-type membrane vesicles in which D-lactate oxidation and D-lactate-dependent transport have been inactivated by 2-hydroxy-3-butynoate. Although treatment of wild-type vesicles with the extract results in an increased capacity to catalyze D-lactate oxidation, no effect on transport is observed. Reconstituted transport activity is a saturable function of the amount of guanidine extract added. Moreover, the quantity of extract required to achieve maximum initial rates of transport varies with each transport system. On the other hand, reconstituted D-lactate oxidation increases linearly over a broader range of extract concentrations.Oxamate, a competitive inhibitor of D-lactate dehydrogenase, and p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate block both the initial rate of transport and the steady-state level of accumulation in reconstituted vesicles. Furthermore, these reagents induce efflux of transport substrates from preloaded, reconstituted vesicles. The same reagents inhibit the initial rate of uptake but not the steady-state level of accumulation in ML 308-225 vesicles, and do not induce efflux. These results suggest that, although reconstituted vesicles catalyze D-lactate oxidation and D-lactate-dependent transport, the system has not been reconstituted to its native state.

Anaerobic β-galactoside transport in whole cells and membrane vesicles from E. coli ML 308-225 is coupled to the oxidation of α-glycerol-P or D-lactate with fumarate as an electron acceptor. Alternatively, anaerobic β-galactoside transport may be coupled to the oxidation of formate utilizing nitrate as electron acceptor. Both anaerobic electron-transfer systems are induced by growth of the organisms under appropriate conditions. Components of both systems are loosely bound to the membrane, necessitating the use of a modified procedure for vesicle preparation in order to demonstrate anaerobic transport in vitro. Addition of ATP or an ATP-generating system to vesicles prepared from anaerobically-grown cells or inclusion of ATP or the ATP-generating system during preparation of vesicles does not stimulate transport. The results support the conclusion that active transport under anaerobic conditions is coupled primarily to electron flow.Images	Anaerobic Transport in Escherichia coli Membrane Vesicles*	Wilhelmus N.

When membrane vesicles prepared from a D-lactate dehydrogenase mutant of E. coli ML 308-225 are treated with a homogeneous preparation of D-lactate dehydrogenase, the enzyme binds to the vesicles and they regain the capacity to catalyze D-lactate oxidation and D-lactate-dependent active transport. Although membranebound enzyme increases linearly with addition of increasing quantities of enzyme, reconstituted transport activity and D-lactate oxidation are saturable functions of the amount of enzyme bound. The maximal specific transport activity obtained in the reconstituted system is similar in magnitude to that of wild type vesicles. Titration studies with 2-(N-dansyl)-aminoethyl-β-D-thiogalactoside demonstrate that there is at least a 7- to 8-fold excess of lac carrier protein relative to D-lactate dehydrogenase. Hydroxybutynoate-inactivated enzyme does not bind to the vesicles, indicating that the coenzyme moiety is critically involved in binding. Conformational changes are also apparently involved since 0.6 M guanidine·HCl is required for optimal binding and reconstitution. The relative unreactivity of reconstituted vesicles towards vinylglycolic acid suggests that D-lactate dehydrogenase is bound to the outer surface of the reconstituted vesicles.

Transport of vinylglycolate (2-hydroxy-3-butenoic acid) via the lactate transport system is the limiting step for covalent labeling of membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli ML 308-225. Thus, the rate and extent of vinylglycolate labeling is stimulated about 10-fold by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, and stimulation is abolished by 2,4-dinitrophenol and by phospholipase treatment, neither of which affect the rate of vinylglycolate oxidation. [3H]Vinylglycolate of high specific activity has been prepared, and vesicles have been labeled with this compound in the presence of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. Examination of these preparations by high resolution radioautography in the electron microscope demonstrates that virtually all of the vesicles are labeled. The experiments provide a strong indication that most, if not all, of the membrane vesicles in these preparations catalyze active transport.Images	Determination of the Absolute Number of Escherichia coli Membrane Vesicles That Catalyze Active Transport*†	S.

The transport of β-galactosides by isolated membrane preparations from Escherichia coli strains containing a functional y gene is markedly stimulated by the conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate. The addition of D-lactate to these membrane preparations produces a 19-fold increase in the initial rate of uptake and a 10-fold stimulation of the steady-state level of intramembranal lactose or thiomethylgalactoside. Succinate, DL-α-hydroxybutyrate, and L-lactate partially replace D-lactate, but are much less effective; ATP and P-enolpyruvate, in addition to a number of other metabolites and cofactors, do not stimulate lactose transport by the vesicles. Lactose uptake by the membrane preparations in the presence of D-lactate requires oxygen, and is blocked by electron transport inhibitors and proton conductors; however, uptake is not significantly inhibited by high concentrations of arsenate or oligomycin. Furthermore, the P-enolpyruvate-P-transferase system is not involved in β-galactoside transport by the E. coli membrane vesicles. The findings indicate that the β-galactoside uptake system is coupled to the membrane-bound D-lactic dehydrogenase via an electron transport chain but does not involve oxidative phosphorylation.	β-GALACTOSIDE TRANSPORT IN BACTERIAL MEMBRANE PREPARATIONS: ENERGY COUPLING VIA MEMBRANE-BOUND D-LACTIC DEHYDROGENASE	Eugene M.

Promitochondria of anaerobically grown Saccharomyces cerevisiae lack cytochromes aa3, b, c1, and c, as well as ubiquinone, yet catalyze a Pi-ATP exchange reaction that is sensitive to uncouplers, rutamycin, and atractyloside. The promitochondrial Pi-ATP exchange reaction is abolished by the cytoplasmic “petite” mutation, as well as by growth of the cells in the presence of erythromycin, which indicates a role of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the assembly of the energy transfer system. These observations demonstrate that mitochondrial energy transfer can occur in the absence of a respiratory chain.	Promitochondria of Anaerobically Grown Yeast, V.

Interaction of uncoupling reagents with bovine serum albumin markedly inhibited its hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes. The inhibition presumably is due to conformational transitions in the protein substrate induced by the binding of the ligand–uncoupling reagents. The proteolysis of casein, a protein that does not bind these reagents, was not affected, indicating that the proteinases themselves were not inactivated. In contrast, interaction of uncoupling reagents with freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria enhanced their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes. This was shown by an increase in the release of ninhydrin-reacting material, by an increase in free acid groups and by a decrease in the turbidity of the mitochondrial suspensions. These effects, although opposite in direction to those obtained with albumin, are also presumed to indicate structural changes in the mitochondrial proteins and a disorganization of the protein–phospholipid complex. It is suggested that such structural alterations are expressed functionally as the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.	Structural changes in mitochondria induced by uncoupling reagents.

At a concentration of 10−6m, nigericin and monactin inhibited growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of excess K+. In the presence of certain antibiotics, the cells exhibited increased permeability to certain cations; internal Rb+ was rapidly lost by exchange with external H+, K+ Rb+, and, more slowly, with Na+ and Li+. No effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Cation exchanges induced by nigericin and monactin were metabolically passive and apparently did not involve the energy-dependent K+ pump. When the cells were washed, the cytoplasmic membrane recovered its original impermeability to cations. By use of monactin, we prepared cells whose K+ content had been completely replaced by other cations, and the metabolic characteristics of K+-depleted cells were studied. Cells containing only Na+ glycolyzed almost as well as did normal ones and, under proper conditions, could accumulate amino acids and orthophosphate. These cells also incorporated 14C-uracil into ribonucleic acid but incorporation of 14C-leucine into protein was strictly dependent upon the addition of K+. When K+ or Rb+ was added to sodium-loaded cells undergoing glycolysis, these ions were accumulated by stoichiometric exchange for Na+. From concurrent measurements of the rate of glycolysis, it was calculated that one mole-pair of cations was exchanged for each mole of adenosine triphosphate produced.

Cells of uninduced Bacillus licheniformis (strain 749) in mid-logarithmic phase have no extensive intracytoplasmic membrane. After induction with cephalosporin C, characteristic organelles that contain tubules and vesicles with single-layered membranes and no visible internal substructure can be seen in thin sections in the periplasm. A magnoconstitutive penicillinase producer (749/C) contains similar structures. It is suggested that they represent a penicillinase secretory apparatus. In the first 15 min after induction, negatively stained preparations of induced 749 show large intracellular vesicles without individual contact with the cell surface. Negatively stained 749/C and fully induced 749 contain invaginations comparable to the structures seen in thin sections. When protoplasts of induced 749 and of 749/C are prepared, vesicles and tubules similar to those seen in thin sections of whole cells are liberated from the cell. Growing protoplasts of induced 749 show massive convolutions of the peripheral membrane, multiple layers of membrane, and characteristic long, slender tubules extending from the protoplast surface. These phenomena are not observed in uninduced 749 except for the production of a relatively small number of tubules. In 749/C, there were fewer convolutions than in induced 749, although tubule production was similar. Multiple layers of membrane were not observed in 749/C. The relation of the penicillinase secretory structures to mesosomes and to secretory structures of other organisms is discussed.Images	Morphological Phenomena Associated with Penicillinase Induction and Secretion in Bacillus licheniformis	B.

We studied the effect of compounds that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation on membrane function in Streptoccocus faecalis, an organism which relies upon glycolysis for the generation of metabolic energy. At low concentrations (ranging from 10−7 to 10−4m), tetrachlorosalicylanilide, tetramethyldipicrylamine, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, pentachlorophenol, and dicoumarol strongly inhibited energy-dependent transport of rubidium, phosphate, and certain amino acids. However, these compounds had little effect on the generation of adenosine triphosphate via glycolysis or on its utilization for the synthesis of macromolecules. They also did not seriously inhibit uptake of those monosaccharides and amino acids which do not require concurrent metabolism. It is proposed that the uncouplers interfere with the utilization of metabolic energy for membrane transport. The uncouplers accelerated the translocation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. It appears that a proton-impermeable membrane is required for transport, perhaps, because a proton gradient is involved in the coupling of metabolic energy to the translocation of substrates across the membrane.

The effect of colicins E1 and K on active transport of β-d-galactosides and of α-methyl-d-glucoside (αMG) by Escherichia coli was studied. These colicins strongly inhibited the accumulation of thio-methyl-galactoside (TMG) by bacteria and caused rapid exit of previously accumulated TMG. The inhibition effect was limited to the accumulation phase of galactoside transport; the rate of hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl galactoside, which is dependent on transport of the substrate by the lactose-permease system, was only slightly affected. The accumulation of αMG was highly resistant to inhibition by these colicins under conditions which caused complete suppression of TMG accumulation. These effects of the colicins on transport resemble qualitatively those of sodium azide. The findings were interpreted by assuming that colicins E1 and K inhibit the energy-dependent steps in the accumulation of TMG but do not affect facilitated diffusion of galactosides mediated by the specific transport mechanism. The continued accumulation of αMG was attributed to the fact that this compound is stored by E. coli cells as a phosphorylated compound by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent transport system rather than by an adenosine triphosphate-linked accumulation mechanism.

Colicins E1 and K inhibited a whole series of energy-dependent reactions in Escherichia coli cells, including motility, biosynthesis of nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides, and the conversion of ornithine to citrulline. Respiration was only partially affected, and substrates such as glucose continued to be catabolized through the normal pathways, albeit with reduced CO2 production. The soluble products of aerobic glucose catabolism by colicin-treated cells were analyzed. Pyruvate replaced acetate as the major excreted product, and the following intermediates of glycolysis were excreted in significant amounts: glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and 3-phosphoglycerate. Anaerobically growing cells manifested a somewhat enhanced tolerance to the colicins. This protection by anaerobiosis appeared to depend on the exclusion of oxygen more than on the extent of fermentative catabolism versus catabolism of the respiratory type. These results are interpreted in terms of possible functions of colicin in lowering the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the cells and in terms of the role of lowered ATP levels in inhibiting many of the energy-requiring reactions.

The translational motility of Pseudomonas fluorescens was weakly inhibited by oligomycin, Dicumarol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, 2n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, and potassium cyanide. Atabrine and antimycin A together with potassium cyanide immediately immobilized this bacterium, but antimycin A alone was without effect. Gramicidin D also immobilized P. fluorescens, but its action was inhibited by K+ and NH4+ ions. In like manner, the effect of p-chloromercuribenzoate could be counteracted with cysteine, thereby suggesting the involvement of —SH groups in flagellar motility processes. It appears that the energy required for motility of P. fluorescens is generated by oxidative phosphorylation mediated by the cytochrome system.

Escherichia coli accumulates thiomethyl-β-d-galactoside against a concentration gradient under anaerobic conditions. The accumulation was abolished by carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, tetrachlorosalicylanilide, 2,4 dinitrophenol, and other uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation even though oxidative phosphorylation would not be expected to occur anaerobically. In the presence of the uncouplers, the β-galactoside carrier remained functional and catalyzed equilibration of thiomethylgalactoside across the membrane. The uncouplers did not inhibit the generation of adenosine triphosphate or protein turnover, or the accumulation of α-methylglucoside and glycerol by phosphorylation. We conclude that, at least anaerobically, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation do not interfere with energy metabolism in general, but prevent the utilization of metabolic energy for the active transport of galactosides. The uncouplers also facilitate passage of protons across the membrane. Various hypotheses are considered to explain why a proton-impermeable membrane may be required for active transport of galactosides and other substrates.

1. The liberation of the vesicles of the mesosomes from protoplasts of Bacillus licheniformis strain 6346 is controlled by the Mg2+ concentration present during the removal of the walls by lysozyme. 2. The functioning of the cytoplasmic membranes is also critically controlled by the Mg2+ concentration. 3. The isolated mesosomes and the cytoplasmic membranes differ in their enzymic activities. Both succinate dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase activities are very low or absent from the mesosomes. 4. The cytoplasmic membranes can also be separated into materials of different density. 5. Distribution of the membranes between these fractions is controlled by the Mg2+ concentration and the growth conditions of the microorganisms.ImagesPLATE 1PLATE 2PLATE 3	Some enzymic activities and chemical properties of the mesosomes and cytoplasmic membranes of Bacillus licheniformis 6346	D.

Mitochondrial membrane potentials and resistances have been determined under various metabolic conditions by the use of piezoelectric-driven microelectrodes. The mean state 3 potentials (about +19 mv) are higher than the potentials in state 4 (about +9 mv). DNP in uncoupling concentrations or KCN have no significant effect on membrane resistance or potential. Previous experiments have shown the potential to be sensitive to mitochondrial swelling and have suggested that it depends predominantly on anionic distribution.Images	MICROELECTRODE STUDIES ON THE MEMBRANE PROPERTIES OF ISOLATED MITOCHONDRIA, II.

Glycolyzing cells of Streptococcus faecalis accumulate K+ with concurrent extrusion of equivalent amounts of H+ and Na+. An attempt was made to clarify the retionship between the movements of Na+ and K+. Sodium was displaced from cells glycolyzing in the presence of ammonia, diethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and other nitrogenous cations; by contrast, K+ was completely retained. Accumulation of K+ by heterologous exchange for Na+ was not inhibited by antibiotics which facilitate diffusion of K+ across the membrane, but was blocked by proton conductors. The results indicate that extrusion of Na+ and H+ from the cells is a primary, energy-linked process which generates an electrical potential (interior negative); K+ accumulation occurs in response to this potential. Two mutants deficient in K+ accumulation and retention were examined in terms of this model. One mutant is apparently defective in exchange of K+ for H+. In the other mutant, exchange of K+ for Na+ is impaired.	Extrusion of Sodium and Hydrogen Ions as the Primary Process in Potassium Ion Accumulation by Streptococcus faecalis	F. M. Harold, J. R.

The fluorescent probe, 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonate (ANS) binds to Escherichia coli, showing an enhanced fluorescence. The interaction of colicin E1 with sensitive cells causes an increase of about 100% in the fluorescence of the bound ANS, and this change at equilibrium has an apparent “all-or-none” nature as a function of E1 multiplicity. Approximately 6 to 8% of the ANS is bound to the cells at equilibrium. The colicin E1-induced fluorescence increase can be attributed partly to an increase in ANS binding and partly to an increase in the fluorescence yield of the bound ANS. The kinetics of the E1-induced fluorescence increase in sensitive cells are very similar to those of the adenosine triphosphate decrease. The phosphorylation uncoupler p-trifluoromethoxy-carbonylcyanidephenylhydrazone also causes a large change in the fluorescence of bound ANS. Colicin E2 or E3 does not cause any fluorescence change, nor does colicin E1 cause fluorescence change with a colicinogenic strain. ANS appears to be a probe of structural or conformational change in the cell envelope that is closely associated with the colicin E1-induced adenosine triphosphate decrease.

An envelope preparation containing the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli was obtained by breaking the cells with a French pressure cell and sedimentating the envelope fraction by ultracentrifugation. This fraction was prepared for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by dissolving the protein in an acidified N,N′-dimethylformamide, removing lipids by gel filtration in the same organic solvent and removing the solvent by dialysis against aqueous urea solutions. More than 80% of the total protein of the envelope fraction was recovered in soluble form. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing gels yielded from 20 to 30 well-resolved bands of protein. One major protein band was observed on the gels. This protein had a molecular weight of 44,000 and accounted for as much as 40% of the total protein of the envelope fraction. A double-labeling technique was used to examine the protein composition of the envelope fraction from cells grown under different sets of conditions which result in large changes in the levels of membrane-bound oxidative enzymes. These changes in growth conditions resulted in only minor alterations in the protein profiles observed on the gels, suggesting that this organism is able to adapt to changes in growth environment with only minor modifications of the major proteins of the cell envelope.

Envelope preparations obtained by passing Escherichia coli cells through a French pressure cell were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation into two distinct particulate fractions. The fraction with the higher density was enriched in fragments derived from the cell wall, as indicated by the high content of lipopolysaccharide, the low content of cytochromes, and the similar morphology of the fragments and intact cell walls. The less-dense fraction was enriched in vesicles derived from the cytoplasmic membrane, as indicated by the enrichment of cytochromes, the enzymes lactic and succinic dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase, and the morphological similarity of the vesicles to intact cytoplasmic membrane. Both fractions were rich in phospholipid. The protein composition was compared by mixing the cytoplasmic membrane-enriched fraction from a 3H-labeled culture with the cell wall-enriched fraction from a 14C-labeled culture and examining the resulting mixture by gel electrophoresis. Thirty-four bands of radioactive protein were resolved; of these, 27 were increased two- to fourfold in the cytoplasmic membrane-enriched fraction, whereas 6 were similarly increased in the cell wall-enriched fraction. One of the proteins which is clearly localized in the cell wall is the protein with a molecular weight of 44,000, which is the major component of the envelope. This protein accounted for 70% of the total protein of the cell wall, and its occurrence in the envelope from spheroplasts suggests that it is a structural protein of the outer membranous component of the cell wall.Images	Protein Composition of the Cell Wall and Cytoplasmic Membrane of Escherichia coli	Carl A.

A study has been made of the effects of both varying the pH and extracellular [K+] on the initial rate of uptake of glycine (v) by a strain of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis that concentrated the amino acid, with respect to the extracellular phase, by up to 1400 times. When no other substrate than glycine was provided and [glycine] was relatively small (≤0.2mm) (1) v increased fivefold when the pH was lowered from 7 to 4.5; (2) v fell by up to about 80% as [K+] rose, K+ behaving as a non-competitive inhibitor of the system, with Ki 0.33mequiv./l at pH7; (3) the absorption of glycine caused up to about 2 or 3 equiv. of K+ to leave the yeast cells. These three phenomena were each less evident when glucose was present. An analogy is drawn between the respective interactions of H+ and K+ with the yeast system and the well recognized effects of Na+ and K+ on amino acid transport in certain mammalian systems.

1. The ATP content of preparations of a strain of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis was lowered below 0.3nmol/mg of yeast by starving the yeast cells in the presence of both antimycin and 5mm-deoxyglucose. 2. When the depleted cells were put at pH4.5 with glycine up to about 20nmol of the amino acid/mg of yeast was absorbed without being chemically modified. The mechanism did not depend on an exchange with endogenous amino acids. 3. The concentration of the absorbed glycine could apparently reach 100–200 times that outside the cells. 4. Replacement of the cellular K+ by Na+ almost stopped amino acid absorption in the presence of antimycin and deoxyglucose, but not in their absence. 5. It is suggested that, when energy metabolism itself had stopped, a purely physical process, namely the movements of H+ and K+ into and out of the yeast respectively, served to concentrate the amino acids in the cells. Both ionic species appear to be co-substrates of the system transporting amino acids.	The concentration of amino acids by yeast cells depleted of adenosine triphosphate	A. A. Eddy, K. Backen, G.

The hook-basal body complex comprising the basal end of purified intact flagella from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was studied in detail with an electron microscope. The E. coli hook can be described as having five or six concentric helical coils. The basal body from E. coli is 27 nm in length and consists of four rings, 22.5 nm in diameter, arranged in two pairs and mounted on a rod. The top pair of rings is connected near their periphery, resembling a closed cylinder. In B. subtilis the basal body looks like that from E. coli, except that the top pair of rings is missing. Hook-basal body complexes from both organisms could be isolated by dissociating the filaments with either urea or acid. Based on our results, two types of basal body structures are proposed, as exemplified by E. coli and B. subtilis, which directly reflect the structure of the gram-negative and gram-positive cell envelopes.Images	Fine Structure and Isolation of the Hook-Basal Body Complex of Flagella from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis	M.

A procedure is described for the purification of the Escherichia coli outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide or L membrane) with flagella still attached. The resulting lipopolysaccharide membrane was in the form of vesicles that had a trilaminar structure in thin section and contained about 55% lipopolysaccharide and 45% protein. T2 or T4 phage preadsorbed to E. coli were found attached to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane. Flagella were bound to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane specifically at the basal body ring closest to the hook (the L ring). The cytoplasmic membrane in preparations from osmotically lysed E. coli spheroplasts or Bacillus subtilis protoplasts was specifically attached to flagella at the basal body ring farthest from the hook (the M ring). In the E. coli preparation, lipopolysaccharide membrane was also present and was attached to the L ring. From these data and a knowledge of the structure and dimensions of the E. coli flagellar basal body and cell envelope, a model for flagellar attachment is deduced.Images	Attachment of Flagellar Basal Bodies to the Cell Envelope: Specific Attachment to the Outer, Lipopolysaccharide Membrane and the Cytoplasmic Membrane	M.

The effects of bacteriocin JF246, produced by Serratia marcescens, on the incorporation of labeled leucine and thymidine, the synthesis of β-galactosidase, the active transport of labeled leucine and α-methyl-d-glucoside, and the cellular levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in Escherichia coli were studied. This bacteriocin strongly inhibited the incorporation of leucine and thymidine into protein and deoxyribonucleic acid, respectively, as well as the active transport of leucine. The accumulation of α-methyl-d-glucoside, which is mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, was not markedly inhibited. The level of ATP in bacteriocin-treated cells rapidly fell to 10 to 15% of the control value. However, the kinetics of inhibition of macromolecular synthesis by various levels of bacteriocin was not related to the kinetics of ATP decline.

1. Proton uptake into the yeast Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, was studied at pH4.5–5.5 in the presence of both antimycin and 2-deoxyglucose to inhibit energy metabolism. Previous work had shown that the cells then absorbed about 20nmol of glycine or l-phenylalanine against a considerable amino acid concentration gradient. The addition of the amino acid immediately stimulated the rate of uptake of protons two- to three-fold. About 2 extra equivalents of H+ accompanied a given amount of the amino acids into the yeast preparations exposed to the metabolic inhibitors for 2–4min and about 1.2 equivalents after 20min exposure. 2. Analogous observations were made during serial additions of glycine, l-phenylalanine, l-leucine and l-lysine to preparations lacking the metabolic inhibitors and deficient in substrates needed for energy metabolism. In fresh cellular preparations the influx of glycine was then closely coupled to a stimulated flow of 2.1 equiv. of H+ into the yeast. A similar number of K+ ions left the cells. About 30% of the extra protons was subsequently ejected from the yeast. Deoxyglucose and antimycin together inhibited the ejection of protons. When the yeast had been fed with glucose energy metabolism was stimulated and almost as many protons as were absorbed with the amino acid were apparently ejected again. 3. Yeast preparations containing Na+, instead of K+, as the principal cation absorbed about 1 extra equivalent of H+ after the addition of phenylalanine, glycine or leucine. This response was not observed in the presence of both deoxyglucose and antimycin. 4. The observations show that H+ and, in certain circumstances, K+ are co-substrates in the transport of the amino acids into the yeast. An analogy is drawn with the roles of Na+ and K+ as co-substrates in certain mammalian systems. The results lead to various models relating the physical flow of the co-substrate ions on the amino acid carrier to the transduction of chemical energy in an associated ion pump forming part of the mechanism for transporting amino acids into the yeast.

The use of fluorescent probes to give continuous readouts of the structural states of mitochondrial membranes during energy coupling seems a logical extension of their use in the study of protein structural changes. A clear correlation of the probes' fluorescence characteristics with the acquisition of energy coupling can be demonstrated in fragmented and natural membrane using 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) and ethidium bromide respectively. The present contribution attempts to bring together contemporary viewpoints of this and other laboratories and the recent experimental data and give some detailed information on probe environment and on the structural or charge changes occurring upon energization.The energy-dependent region of the membrane is located at an aqueous interface between an outer layer of proteins (presumably cytochromes) and the membrane permeability barrier; the aromatic portion of ANS appears to be located in the lipid phase and the sulfonic acid group in the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase is probably a structured water region near paramagnetic membrane components such as cytochrome. Membrane energization arising from altered redox potential changes of cytochromes (bT) is communicated to the water structure through altered structural states of the hemoproteins, causing a decreased volume of the structured water region and increased interaction with the paramagnetic components in the energized state. Attendant alterations of protonic equilibria of membrane components induce both local and transmembrane changes in charge distribution, with consequent movements of ions, including the probe molecules themselves.

Streptococcus lactis (ATCC 7962) accumulated thiomethyl-β-galactoside (TMG) and other galactosides against concentration gradients when the cells were supplied with a metabolizable substrate, such as glucose. The accumulated TMG was free and not phosphorylated. In the absence of glucose, TMG rapidly entered the cell to a concentration equal to that of the medium. Agents that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation abolished active transport but not the carrier-facilitated entry of TMG. Evidence that the transport carriers were functional in the absence of glucose or in the presence of uncoupling agents included the demonstration of counterflow, which depends on competitive inhibition for the carrier for exit.

1. A spectroscopic resolution has been made of the components contributing to the `iron-flavoprotein' trough extending from 450 to 520nm in the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of submitochondrial particles of Torulopsis utilis. 2. Seven components were identified other than cytochrome b, ubiquinone and succinate dehydrogenase. On the basis of the effects of iron- and sulphate-limited growth of cells on their subsequently derived electron-transport particles, and also by consideration of analytical measurements of the concentration of FMN, FAD, non-haem iron and acid-labile sulphide in the electron-transport particles in relation to the magnitude of the spectroscopic changes, it was possible to identify five of these components as follows: species 1a, the flavin of NADH dehydrogenase ferroflavoprotein; species 1b, the iron–sulphur component of NADH dehydrogenase ferroflavoprotein; species 1′, the flavin of an NADPH dehydrogenase; species 2, an iron–sulphur or ferroflavoprotein component; species 3, the flavin of l-3-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. Two additional components were a fluorescent flavoprotein, probably lipoamide dehydrogenase, and a b-type cytochrome reducible by NADH or NADPH but not reoxidizable by the respiratory chain. 3. Species 1b and 2 were undetectable in electron-transport particles from iron- or sulphate-limited cells, but could be recovered in vivo under non-growing conditions. 4. The recovery in vivo of species 2 but not species 1b was inhibited by cycloheximide. 5. The recovery of species 1b correlates with the recovery of site 1 conservation. 6. The recovery of species 1b with species 2 correlates with the recovery of piericidin A sensitivity. 7. Evidence is presented for an NADPH dehydrogenase distinct from NADH dehydrogenase. The oxidation of NADH and NADPH by the respiratory chain is sensitive to piericidin A, and an iron–sulphur protein common to both pathways (species 2) is suggested as the piericidin A-sensitive component. 8. The approximate E′0 (pH7.0) values of species 1 (a and b, low potential) and species 2 (high potential) indicate that site 1 energy conservation occurs between the levels of species 1 (a and b) and species 2.

1. Mitochondria prepared from Torulopsis utilis grown in a chemostat with iron-limited growth were found to lack energy conservation but not electron flow in that segment of the respiratory chain leading from intramitochondrial NADH to the cytochromes [i.e. the site 1 segment (Lehninger, 1964)]. 2. Site 1 energy conservation was present in mitochondria prepared from cells grown under conditions of limitation by glycerol, ammonium and magnesium. Phosphate-limited growth resulted in mitochondrial preparations without respiratory control. 3. Mitochondria from cells grown under conditions of iron limitation were insensitive to the respiratory inhibitor piericidin A, whereas sensitivity was present in mitochondria prepared from glycerol-, ammonium-, magnesium- or phosphate-limited cells. 4. These observations are considered to provide indirect evidence for a role of non-haem iron in the mechanism of energy conservation and also piericidin A sensitivity in T. utilis mitochondria. 5. A readily constructed and inexpensive pH-measuring and -controlling circuit is described for use with continuous-culture apparatus.

1. During copper-limited growth of Candida utilis in continuous culture on a non-fermentable carbon and energy source there is a selective pressure favouring the emergence of variants that are less dependent on copper. 2. We describe the properties of such a variant that by-passes cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) by utilizing an alternative oxidase communicating with the respiratory chain at about the level of cytochrome b. 3. Both direct studies of isolated mitochondria and calculations based on growth parameters showed that only one of the normal three phosphorylation sites was active. This site was localized between NADH and the cytochromes. 4. Growth of the variant with copper-supplemented media resulted in the return of cytochrome oxidase but not the loss of the alternative oxidase. 5. The alternative oxidase is inhibited by substituted benzhydroxamic acids. 6. Submitochondrial particles from the variant did not exhibit any novel electron-paramagnetic-resonance-spectroscopy features at about g=2.0 either at 80°K or 12°K.

A polyester embedding technique was used to study the early stages of spore formation in members of the genus Bacillus in order to investigate further the origin and nature of the initial spore septum and the resulting forespore envelope. Whereas previously, with a methacrylate procedure, this layer had appeared to be continuous with the cell wall, this study reveals it as a double layer of cytoplasmic membrane. Perisporal, membranous organelles connected both to the developing forspore envelope and to the cytoplasmic membrane were encountered in the four species studied. Similar organelles were prominent during growth at the sites of transverse septa formation. These were connected to, or continuous with, the cytoplasmic membrane and often adherent to the chromatin bodies of the dividing bacilli.

The ability of either glucose or D-lactate to energize active transport of amino acids in E. coli was studied in starved cells blocked at specific sites of energy metabolism. Proline uptake could be driven by either oxidative or substrate-level processes. The oxidative pathway was sensitive to cyanide but not to arsenate, and operated normally in a mutant deficient in the Ca, Mg-dependent ATPase. The substrate-level pathway, which was active with glucose but not with D-lactate as the carbon source, was sensitive to arsenate but not to cyanide, and required a functional ATPase. Uncouplers prevented the utilization of energy for proline uptake by either pathway.Energy coupling for glutamine uptake was quite different. The oxidative pathway was sensitive to cyanide and uncouplers and, in contrast with proline, required an active ATPase. The glycolytic component was resistant to cyanide and uncouplers, and functioned normally in the ATPase mutant. Arsenate abolished glutamine transport energized by either pathway.The results suggest that proline transport is driven directly by an energy-rich membrane state, which can be generated by either electron transport or ATP hydrolysis. Glutamine uptake, on the other hand, is apparently driven directly by phosphate-bond energy formed by way of oxidative or substrate-level phosphorylations.

The isolation of a new thermophilic bacterium, Thermus aquaticus gen. n. and sp. n., is described. Successful enrichment requires incubation at 70 to 75 C, and the use of nutrient media relatively dilute with respect to the organic components. Strains of T. aquaticus have been isolated from a variety of thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and from a thermal spring in California. The organism has also been isolated from man-made thermal habitats, such as hot tap water, in geographical locations quite distant from thermal springs. Isolates of T. aquaticus are gram-negative nonsporulating nonmotile rods which frequently form long filaments at supraoptimal temperatures or in the stationary phase. All isolates form a yellow cellular pigment, probably a carotenoid. A characteristic structure formed by all isolates is a large sphere, considerably larger than a spheroplast. These large spheres, as well as lysozyme-induced spheroplasts, are resistant to osmotic lysis. Deoxyribonucleic acid base compositions of four strains were determined by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation and found to be between 65.4 and 67.4 moles per cent guanine plus cytosine. The growth of all isolates tested is inhibited by fairly low concentrations of cycloserine, streptomycin, penicillin, novobiocin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Nutritional studies on one strain showed that it did not require vitamins or amino acids, although growth was considerably faster in enriched than in synthetic medium. Several sugars and organic acids served as carbon sources, and either NH4+ or glutamate could serve as nitrogen source. The organism is an obligate aerobe and has a pH optimum of 7.5 to 7.8. The optimum temperature for growth is 70 C, the maximum 79 C, and the minimum about 40 C. The generation time at the optimum is about 50 min. The possible relationships of this new genus to the myxobacteria, flexibacteria, and flavobacteria are discussed.Images	Thermus aquaticus gen. n. and sp. n., a Nonsporulating Extreme Thermophile	Thomas D.

Thermus aquaticus contains four major fatty acids, iso-C15 (28%), iso-C16 (9%), normal-C16 (13%), and iso-C17 (48%), when grown at 70 C, as determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Small amounts of iso-C12, normal-C12:1, iso-C13, normal-C14, iso-C14, and normal-C15:1 were also detected. A change in growth temperature (50 to 75 C at 5-C intervals) affects a shift in the proportions of some of the fatty acids. The proportions of the monoenoic and branched-C17 fatty acids decreased and the proportions of the higher-melting iso-C16 and normal-C16 fatty acids increased. Cells grown at 75 C contained 70% more total fatty acids than cells grown at 50 C. The largest increases, in absolute amounts, were in the content of iso-C16 and normal-C16 fatty acids, with only a 1.6-fold increase in the major iso-C15 and iso-C17 fatty acids. There was a 2.5-fold decrease in normal-C15:1 and at least a 24-fold decrease in anteiso-C17, which is present at 50 and 55 C but not at higher temperatures. There was no difference in proportion or amount of fatty acids between exponential and stationary-phase cells grown at 70 C. When cells were grown on glutamate instead of yeast-extract and tryptone at 70 C, the total fatty acid content remained constant, but there was an increase in the proportions of iso-C16 and normal-C16 fatty acids concomitant with a decrease in the proportions of the iso-C15 and iso-C17 fatty acids.

The complex lipids of Thermus aquaticus include phospholipids, glucolipids, carotenoids, and vitamin K2 isoprenologues. The phospholipids account for 30% of the total lipids and have been identified as phosphatidylethanolamine (4%), phosphatidylglycerol (3%), phosphatidylinositol (10%), cardiolipin (3%), and phosphatidic acid (1%). The major phospholipid contained three fatty acids, a long-chain unsaturated amine, and one glycerol per phosphate and accounted for 80% of the lipid phosphate. The carotenoids accounted for 60% of the membrane lipid. The majority of the carotenoids were very polar. Mono- and diglucosyldiglyceride and the 35-, 40-, and 45-carbon vitamin K2 isoprenologues were also identified. All these lipids were localized in the membrane of T. aquaticus. When the growth temperature was increased from 50 to 75 C and measured at 5 C intervals, there was a progressive increase in the total lipid content. The phospholipids increased 2-fold, the carotenoids increased 1.8-fold, and the glucolipids increased 4-fold between cells grown at 50 C and 75 C. The vitamin K2 level did not change. The proportions of the individual lipids within each lipid class remained constant as the temperature of growth was raised. Metabolic studies indicated turnover of the diacyl phospholipids during pulse-chase experiments at rates comparable with mesophilic bacteria. The major phospholipid and the carotenoids did not turn over.Images	Effect of Growth Temperature on the Lipid Composition of Thermus aquaticus	Paul H. Ray, David C. White, Thomas D.

A thermostable β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23; β-dgalactoside galactohydrolase) was found to be inducible in an extreme thermophile resembling Thermus aquaticus. Enzyme induction was achieved by the addition of lactose, galactose, or the α-galactoside, melibiose, to growing cultures. The addition of glucose to induced cultures had a repressive effect on further enzyme synthesis. The enzyme was purified 78-fold, and the optimum temperature and pH for activity were determined to be 80 C and pH 5.0, respectively. The enzyme was activated by both manganese and ferrous iron. Sulfhydryl activation and thermal stabilization indicate that the thermophilic β-galactosidase is a sulfhydryl enzyme. Kinetic determinations at 80 C established a Km of 2.0 × 10−3m for the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and a K1 of 7.5 × 10−3m for lactose. The Arrhenius energy of activation (for the hydrolysis of ONPG) was calculated to be 13.7 kcal/mole. A molecular weight of 5.7 × 105 daltons was estimated by elution of the enzyme from Sephadex 4B.

Threonine deaminase (l-threonine dehydratase EC 4.2.1.16) has been partially purified from a new extreme thermophilic bacterium, Thermus X-1, which is similar to T. aquaticus YT-1. The threonine deaminase of strain X-1 has a maximal rate of reaction at 85 to 90 C and is more thermostable than the threonine deaminase from mesophilic bacteria. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 to 115,000, a Km for l-threonine of 14 mM, a pH optimum of 8.0, and like other threonine deaminases also catalyzes the deamination of serine. However the Thermus X-1 threonine deaminase does not show a strong feedback inhibition by isoleucine. It is suggested that the regulation of the biosynthesis of isoleucine in this extreme theromophile may resemble that reported in Rodospirillum rubrum.

Protoplasts of Bacillus stearothermophilus NCA 1503-4R are resistant to osmotic rupture and are not sensitive to mechanical manipulation. Protoplast stability is maintained by divalent cations. The thermostability of protoplasts is enhanced when the cells are grown at elevated temperatures. The membrane content of the cell and the protein-to-lipid ratio of the membrane increases as the growth temperature is increased. The membrane-bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) oxidase system from cultures grown at 70 C was more thermostable than the same enzyme system from cultures grown at 55 C. Alkaline phosphatase was resistant to thermal inactivation in the intact protoplast. The extent of this protection is dependent on protoplast stability.Images	Membranes of Bacillus stearothermophilus: Factors Affecting Protoplast Stability and Thermostability of Alkaline Phosphatase and Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Oxidase	Charlene Wisdom, N.

"1. The uptake of glycine-N15 by components of cell nuclei was studied. The nuclear components were derived both from tissues with high metabolic rates-mammalian liver, kidney, and pancreas-and from cells with relatively low rates of metabolism-avian erythrocytes and echinoderm sperm. N15 uptake by nuclear components of liver, kidney, and pancreas was far more rapid than by those of erythrocytes and sperm. 2. The nuclear components of liver, kidney, and pancreas for which measurements were made were DNA, histone, and residual protein of chromatin. Uptake into DNA was low, into histone higher, and into residual protein much higher still, being comparable with that into mixed cytoplasmic protein. 3. A comparison of the uptake of N15 by the chromosomal components, histone and DNA of liver, pancreas, and kidney showed that chromosomal ""activity"" varies in different cells and also in the same cell depending upon its over-all activity."

"The composition of isolated nuclei and cell preparations from tissues of calf, beef, horse, and fowl was studied with respect to the following components: 1. Liver and kidney arginase, catalase, and uricase; pancreatic lipase and amylase; cardiac muscle myoglobin; erythrocyte hemoglobin; intestinal alkaline phospharase. These are referred to as ""special"" components in view of their characteristically restricted distribution reflecting the differentiated nature of the tissues in question. 2. Esterase, β-glucuronidase, alkaline and nucleotide phosphatases, adenosine deaminase, guanase, and nucleoside phosphorylase. These are enzymes of general distribution. The differences in nuclear composition noted with respect to the ""special"" components, together with the broad variability in nuclear activity found for enzymes of general distribution, led to the conclusion that nuclei are differentiated structures. The following distribution was observed: 1. ""Special"" components: Hemoglobin was found to be present in fowl and goose erythrocyte nuclei, but myoglobin was entirely absent from heart muscle nuclei; of the special enzymes listed, only catalase and arginase appeared to be concentrated in some of the nuclei. There was no significant nuclear concentration of lipase, amylase, uricase, or alkaline phosphatase. No simple relationship was found between the concentration of a special enzyme in a tissue and its activity in the corresponding nuclei. For example, arginase activity, which is high in mammalian liver and in fowl kidney, was found in liver, not kidney, nuclei. Similarly, catalase activity was demonstrated only in mammalian liver nuclei, although, in mammals, both liver and kidney are rich sources of this enzyme. 2. Enzymes of general distribution fell into three classes: (a) Those present in low concentrations, if at all, in the nuclei—alkaline phosphatase, the nucleotide phosphatases) and β-glucuronidase. (b) Those present in nuclei in varying concentrations—esterase. (c) Those present in high proportions in most nuclei—adenosine deaminase, nucleoside phosphorylase, and guanase. The exceptionally low nuclear activity of intestinal mucosa with respect to these enzymes was discussed in relation to physiological considerations. The response of nuclei to changes in physiological state was demonstrated by experiments on starvation. The outstanding aspect of this response was a change in nuclear enzymatic activity opposing that observed in the cytoplasm. A comparison of fetal and adult mucosa cells led to the following tentative interpretation of the observed intracellular enzyme distribution: In cells tending to moribundity, as in those subjected to starvation, relative nuclear enzymatic activity falls. The occurrence of special enzymes in nuclei was considered in terms of differentiation, and the high nuclear concentration of the nucleoside-specific enzymes was interpreted in terms of general nuclear metabolic activity."

The purity of these nuclei has been established by staining reactions, enzyme studies, and immunological tests for serum proteins. 3. Evidence is presented to show that a transport of cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus does not occur during the isolation. 4. Nuclei prepared in non-aqueous media contain considerably more protein and a very different enzyme composition from that observed in nuclei prepared by ""homogenization"" techniques in dilute citric acid. 5. The suitability of nuclei prepared in organic media for the study of intracellular enzyme distribution is discussed."	THE ISOLATION OF CELL NUCLEI IN NON-AQUEOUS MEDIA	V. Allfrey, H. Stern, A. E.

1. The preparation and properties of lysine-rich histones, which differ in a number of respects from the classical arginine-rich histones, have been described. 2. Lysine-rich histones, like those previously known, are located in cell nuclei. 3. Lysine-rich histones dissociate more readily from combination with nucleic acid than do other histones.

1. The metabolism of chromosomal proteins has been studied in the pancreas, liver, and kidney of adult mice (a) by measuring the rates of glycine-N15 incorporation into histones and residual chromosome fractions, and (b) by measuring the extent to which N15, once incorporated into chromosomal proteins, is retained. 2. The uptake of isotopic nitrogen by these nuclear constituents was compared with that of protein fractions prepared from the cytoplasm by differential centrifugation in sucrose solutions. One such fraction, which comprises the bulk of the ribosenucleoprotein of the cell sediments as a pellet on high speed centrifugation. The supernatant remaining after this centrifugation is a fraction which, in the pancreas, is rich in the secretory enzymes synthesized by the cell. 3. A comparison of the rates of glycine-N15 uptake shows that cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein is the most active of the protein fractions analyzed. In the pancreas it meets the conditions required of a precursor for the secretory enzymes of the supernate. 4. In all tissues considered the rates of glycine-N15 uptake into histone and residual chromosome fractions are lower, that for histone being the lowest of any of the protein components considered and that for residual protein approximating the over-all rate for cytoplasmic protein. 5. The effects of feeding and fasting upon glycine-N15 incorporation have been studied. In the pancreas, feeding causes a sharp increase in N15 uptake by the mixed tissue proteins and by the nucleoprotein and supernatant protein of the cytoplasm. There is a parallel increase in N15 uptake by the chromosomal constituents—histone and residual protein. 6. A parallelism between N15 uptake in cytoplasmic and chromosomal proteins is also observed in the liver and kidney when over-all protein metabolism is altered by feeding and fasting. 7. The responsiveness of the histones and residual proteins to changes in the environment has also been demonstrated in N15 retention experiments. The loss of isotope once incorporated into chromosomal proteins is much more rapid in fed than in fasted animals.	SOME OBSERVATIONS ON PROTEIN METABOLISM IN CHROMOSOMES OF NON-DIVIDING CELLS	V. G.

1. The ribonucleoprotein of the microsome fraction which sediments at 40,000 R.P.M. as a pellet (and which is referred to as the pellet material) has been studied with reference to its role in protein synthesis in the pancreas. 2. In pellet material nucleic acid and protein form a definite complex as shown by its electrophoretic behavior and unchanging composition under various conditions. 3. Protein of pellet material is not especially rich in the diamino acids. 4. Evidence is brought forward indicating that the protein component of pellet material takes part in the general process of protein synthesis in the cell. (a) The well known correlation between quantity of RNA and rate of protein synthesis in a tissue implicates the protein of the pellet material, for most of the RNA in the pancreas and other tissues is in this material. (b) Uptake of isotopically labelled glycine by the pellet material, confirming results of previous workers, is for short periods greater than in other protein fractions. (c) Comparing the pellet materials of pancreas, liver, and kidney—three tissues with vastly different rates of protein synthesis, in the sequence given—there is a correlation between the quantity of RNA in the pellet and the rate of protein synthesis in the tissue; a similar correlation between quantity of RNA in the pellet material and rate of N15-glycine uptake by the protein component of the pellet; and finally, the level of uptake by total protein varies with the tissue and is related to the uptake of N15-glycine by protein of the pellet. 5. In the pancreas a distinction can be made between proteins synthesized for secretion and the nucleoprotein of the pellet (not found in the secretion) which, however, takes part in the synthetic process, as shown by the fact that the N15 uptake by protein of the pellet is increased when the synthesis of digestive enzymes is stimulated by secretion. 6. The time course of N15 uptake by proteins of the pancreas indicates that pellet protein serves as precursor material in the synthesis of the secretory proteins. 7. Rate of uptake of N15-glycine by the purines of RNA of the pellet material is not correlated with uptake by the protein. 8. The uptake of C14-alanine by an in vitro system of microsomes + mitochondria is impaired by preincubation of the microsomes with ribonuclease. This is direct experimental evidence for the dependence of protein synthesis upon the presence or intactness of ribonucleic acid in the microsomes.	SYNTHESIS OF PROTEIN IN THE PANCREAS II.

Nuclei of calf thymus and liver and of rat liver were isolated in sucrose media and a number of their properties studied in relation to those of corresponding nuclei isolated in non-aqueous media with a view to determining their capacity to retain soluble components. The best preparations of sucrose nuclei were obtained from calf thymus. Cytochrome oxidase measurements and DNA/N ratios were far less sensitive than microscopic examination as indicators of purity when rat liver and calf thymus nuclei were compared. No satisfactory preparation of calf liver nuclei was obtained, contamination with whole cells having been appreciable; such preparations, nevertheless, could be used to advantage in the tests undertaken. DNA content of thymus nuclei isolated in sucrose was much the same as that of non-aqueous ones, pointing to a retention of soluble protein under aqueous conditions of isolation. That this net retention of protein was not due to the impermeability of the nuclear membrane was shown by the hydrolysis of the DNA upon addition of some crystalline DNAase to a sucrose suspension of nuclei. A comparative study of liver and thymus nuclei isolated in aqueous and non-aqueous media with respect to the soluble enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase, and nucleoside phosphorylase yielded the following results: 1. Lyophilization of sucrose-isolated nuclei and their extraction with the organic solvents used in the non-aqueous procedure did not inactivate any of the enzymes tested. In the case of thymus the reverse was true, there being a marked increase in activity of all the enzymes studied. 2. In thymus, nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase were active to approximately the same extent in nuclei isolated by either procedure. Glucose phosphate dehydrogenase alone was more active in sucrose-isolated nuclei, pointing to the possibility of an adsorption of this enzyme. 3. In rat liver nuclei isolated in sucrose, lyophilization and treatment with organic solvents revealed only the presence of some dehydrogenase. 4. The washing out of soluble enzymes was most markedly demonstrated in the case of calf liver. Only traces of the nucleoside enzymes were found in the sucrose-isolated nuclei, and in the case of the dehydrogenase only a half of that present in the non-aqueous nucleus remained. The main conclusions drawn were as follows:— 1. In sucrose media the nuclear membrane is ineffectual in preventing the inward or outward diffusion of protein. 2. The extent to which soluble proteins are retained by a nucleus isolated in sucrose appears to depend upon internal structural factors, such as the concentration of DNA in the nucleus. 3. With respect to determining the composition of nuclei in terms of soluble components, the sucrose isolation procedure is considered to be of indifferent merit and hence invalid for such a type of analysis.

A study has been made of calf thymus and liver tissue to ascertain the position of the nucleus with respect to mechanisms capable of hydrogen transfer. Although previous work had shown that reduced pyridine nucleotide coenzymes are produced in the course of nuclear metabolism, it has now been established that the flavoprotein system of cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c, and most, if not all, of other flavoproteins are absent from nuclei. Metabolites capable of cytochrome c reduction, notably ascorbic acid and glutathione, have been demonstrated in the nuclei. Glutathione reductase has been found present in nuclei only to a minor extent, suggesting that nuclear glutathione might function largely in a capacity other than that of hydrogen carrier in the nucleus. Although no enzymatic relation could be established between ascorbic acid and hydrogen transfer in nuclei) it was possible to demonstrate a close association between ascorbic acid concentration and the mitotic process in lily anthers. The significance of the anaerobic character of nuclear metabolism to chromosome function is discussed.

"1. An improved type of ground glass homogenizer for soft tissues has been described which brings about a high degree of cell disruption and liberation of nuclei without causing appreciable damage to mitochondria. The gentleness and effectiveness of the new homogenizer in respect to isolation of mitochondria have been ascertained by comparing the ATP-ase activities of mitochondria isolated in 0.25 M sucrose solution without pH adjustment using a previous type of homogenizer with those of mitochondria isolated under the same conditions with the aid of the new homogenizer. In these experiments sucrose of 0.25 molarity without pH adjustment has been used in order to maintain the mitochondria in a rather sensitive state so as to make slightly deleterious effects of homogenization readily apparent. 2. A new method is described for the isolation of morphologically intact mitochondria and cell nuclei from the same homogenate. In this procedure the pH of the homogenate in 0.44 M sucrose is maintained at 6.0–6.2 with citric acid during the homogenization. An alternative method employing 0.44 M sucrose plus 0.005 M CaCl2 is given for the isolation of nuclei from tumor cells. However, the latter method does not produce unaltered mitochondria. 3. The α-ketoglutarate, malate, succinate, and hexanoate oxidases of the ""intact"" mitochondria isolated in 0.44 M sucrose adjusted to pH 6.0–6.2 with very dilute citric acid as described in this paper have been investigated, and it has been shown that the mitochondria compare favorably to those isolated in 0.25 M sucrose by a previously described method. 4. Mitochondria have been found to contain an enzyme which causes nuclei to lose their ability to form gels in dilute alkali. This enzyme is released from the mitochondria when the latter are disrupted. 5. Some properties of nuclei isolated by the new method have been briefly discussed."

"Rat liver, liver homogenates, and microsome fractions separated therefrom were examined systematically in the electron microscope in sections of OsO4-fixed, methacrylate-embedded tissue and pellets. It was found that most microsomes are morphologically identical with the rough surfaced elements of the endoplasmic reticula of hepatic cells. They appear as isolated, membrane-bound vesicles, tubules, and cisternae which contain an apparently homogeneous material of noticeable density, and bear small, dense particles (100 to 150 A) attached to their outer aspect. In solutions of various osmolar concentrations they behave like osmometers. The findings suggest that they derive from the endoplasmic reticulum by a generalized pinching-off process rather than by mechanical fragmentation. The microsome fractions contain in addition relatively few vesicles free of attached particles, probably derived from the smooth surfaced parts of the endoplasmic reticula. Dense, peribiliary bodies represent a minor component of the same fractions. The microsomes derived from 1 gm. wet weight liver pulp contained (averages of 10 experiments) 3.09 mg. protein N, 3.46 mg. RNA (RNA/protein N = 1.12), and 487 µg. phospholipide P. They displayed DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity and contained an alcohol-soluble hemochromogen. The microsome preparations proved resistant to washing and ""aging."" Treatment with versene and incubation with ribonuclease (30 minutes at 37°C.) resulted in appreciable losses of RNA and in partial or total disappearance of attached particles. Treatment with deoxycholate (0.3 to 0.5 per cent, pH = 7.5) induced a partial clarification of the microsome suspensions which, upon centrifugation, yielded a small pellet of conglomerated small, dense particles (100 to 150 A) with only occasionally interspersed vesicles. The pellet contained ∼80 to 90 per cent of the RNA and ∼20 per cent of the protein N of the original microsomes. The supernatant accounted satisfactorily for the materials lost during deoxycholate treatment. The findings suggest that the microsomal RNA is associated with the small particles whereas most of the protein and nearly all of the phospholipide, hemochromogen, and DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity are associated with the membrane or content of the microsomes."

1. Mitochondria isolated from rat liver were disrupted with 0.3 per cent deoxycholate and a number of subfractions were isolated from this preparation by differential centrifugation. 2. The protein N, RNA and phospholipide content, as well as the succinoxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, adenylate kinase, and DPNH-cytochrome c reductase of these fractions were determined. 3. Two of these subfractions, found to consist of mitochondrial membranes (2), contained ∼ 12 per cent of the protein N and ∼ 35 per cent of the phospholipide of the whole mitochondria and accounted for ∼ 70 per cent of the succinoxidase and cytochrome c oxidase activity of the original mitochondrial preparation. There was no discernible adenylate kinase, DPNH-cytochrome c reductase, or phosphorylating activities in these fractions, nor could they oxidize other substrates of the Krebs's cycle. 4. The most active fraction (60 minutes at 105,000 g pellet) had a higher phospholipide/protein value than the whole mitochondria and showed a seven-to elevenfold concentration of succinoxidase and cytochrome c oxidase activities. 5. Evidence has been given to indicate that the various components of the succinoxidase complex are present in this membrane fraction in the same relative proportions as in the whole mitochondria. 6. The implications of these findings are discussed.	CYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF MITOCHONDRIA II. ENZYMES ASSOCIATED WITH A MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE FRACTION	Philip Siekevitz, Michael L.

Several types of striated muscle have been examined by the technics of electron microscopy and the findings in myotome fibers of Amblystoma larvae, the sartorius, and cardiac muscle of the rat are reported on in some detail. Particular attention has been given to structural components of the interfibrillar sarcoplasm and most especially to a finely divided, vacuolar system known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This consists of membrane-limited vesicles, tubules, and cisternae associated in a continuous reticular structure which forms lace-like sleeves around the myofibrils. It shows a definable organization which repeats with each sarcomere of the fiber so that the entire system is segmented in phase with the striations of the associated myofibrils. Details of these repetitive patterns are presented diagrammatically in Text-figs. 1, 2, and 3 on pages 279, 283, and 288 respectively. The system is continuous across the fiber at the H band level and largely discontinuous longitudinally because of interruptions in the structure at the I and Z band levels. The structure of the system relates it to the endoplasmic reticulum of other cell types. The precise morphological relation of the reticulum to the myofibrils, with specializations opposite the different bands, prompts the supposition that the system is functionally important in muscle contraction. In this regard it is proposed that the membrane limiting the system is polarized like the sarcolemma and that the corresponding potential difference is utilized in the intracellular distribution of the excitatory impulse.

"An artificial system is studied consisting of salt solutions of different concentrations separated by a porous, ""charged"" membrane, through which a constant electric current is passed. Experiments on such systems demonstrate rhythmic variations of the transmembrane potential and the membrane resistance, which are concomitant with an oscillatory streaming of water solution across the membrane. The repetitive oscillations can be of a damped or undamped type dependent on the ""stimulating"" current density. A qualitative discussion of the mechanism of the oscillations is given. It centers around the periodic resistance changes in the membrane, which result from a complicated interplay between the driving forces present. The importance of electro-osmotic effects is emphasized. A few comparisons relating to possible electrophysiological implications are presented. In the metastable state of this membrane oscillator, ""make"" and ""break"" responses can be triggered by electric as well as by mechanical (pressure) ""stimuli."""

"A quantitative theory is presented for the behavior of a membrane-electrolyte system subject to an electric current flow (the ""membrane oscillator""). If the membrane is porous, carries ""fixed charges,"" and separates electrolyte solutions of different conductances, it can be the site of repetitive oscillatory changes in the membrane potential, the membrane resistance, and the hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane. These events are accompanied by a pulsating transport of bulk solutions. The theory assumes the superposition of electrochemical and hydrostatic gradients and centers round the kinetics of resistance changes within the membrane, as caused by effects from diffusion and electro-osmotic fluid streaming. The results are laid down in a set of five simple, basic expressions, which can be transformed into a pair of non-linear differential equations yielding oscillatory solutions. A graphical integration method is also outlined (Appendix II). The agreement between the theory and previous experimental observations is satisfactory. The applied electrokinetic concepts may have importance in relation to analyses of the behavior of living excitable cells or tissues."

The vesicles of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum, i.e. the physiological relaxing factor, remove most of the exchangeable Ca bound to actomyosin and myofibrils. The extent to which they remove Ca and the extent to which they inhibit myofibrillar activity are closely correlated. Previous work has shown that those in vitro reactions of actomyosin with ATP which are equivalent to its contraction, i.e. superprecipitation and a high ATPase activity, require the formation of a Ca-actomyosin complex, and that actomyosin after the removal of most of its bound Ca is inhibited by physiological concentrations of ATP. The evidence now suggests that the factor achieves its relaxing effect through the dissociation of the Ca-actomyosin complex and that it has no other direct influence on the biological activity of actomyosin. Experiments, showing that under similar conditions the vesicles of the factor are capable of reducing the concentration of ionized Ca in the surrounding medium to about 0.02 µM and less, suggest that the factor competes successfully with actomyosin for the available Ca through its mechanism of Ca accumulation.

Dense, homogeneous granules of 250 to 350 mµ in diameter have been found inside the cavities of the endoplasmic reticulum in the acinar cells of the pancreas of the guinea pig. They apparently correspond to the fine granules described in the same material in light microscopy by Mankowski and Bensley. The location of these granules indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum is a cavitary system and suggests its participation in secretory processes.	INTRACISTERNAL GRANULES IN THE EXOCRINE CELLS OF THE PANCREAS	George E. Palade	13357506	1956-07-25	19	
The pancreatic exocrine cell of the guinea pig has a voluminous endoplasmic reticulum distinguished by extensive association with small, dense particles, and by its orderly disposition in the basal region of the cell. In addition to the small, (∼15 mµ), dense particles attached to the limiting membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, numerous particles of similar appearance are found freely scattered in the cytoplasmic matrix. The various cell structures of pancreatic exocrine cells can be satisfactorily identified in pancreatic homogenates. The microsome fraction consists primarily of spherical vesicles (80 to 300 mµ), limited by a thin membrane (7 mµ) which bears small (∼15 mµ) dense particles attached on its outer surface. The content of the microsomal vesicles is usually of high density. Pancreatic microsomes derive by extensive fragmentation mainly from the rough surfaced parts of the endoplasmic reticula of exocrine cells. A few damaged mitochondria and certain dense granules (∼150 mµ) originating probably from islet cells, contaminate the microsome fraction. Pancreatic microsomes contain RNA, protein, and a relatively small amount of phospholipide and hemochromogen. They do not have DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity. In six experiments the RNA/protein N ratios were found grouped around two different means, namely 0.6 and 1.3. Pancreatic microsomes are more labile than liver microsomes but react in a similar way to RN-ase-(loss of the particulate component and RNA), and deoxycholate treatment (loss of the membranous component and of phospholipide, hemochromogen, and most of the protein). Postmicrosomal fractions consisting primarly of small (∼15 mµ), dense particles of ribonucleoprotein (RNA/protein N ratio = 1 to 2) were obtained by further centrifugation of the microsomal supernatant. The small nucleoprotein particles of these fractions are frequently found associated in chains or clusters.	PANCREATIC MICROSOMES AN INTEGRATED MORPHOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL STUDY	G. E. Palade, P. Siekevitz	13398437	1956-11-25	19	
Pancreatic tissue, (guinea pig) homogenized in 0.88 M sucrose, was fractionated by differential centrifugation into a nuclear, zymogen, mitochondrial, microsomal, and final supernatant fraction. The components of the particulate fractions were identified with well known intracellular structures by electron microscopy. The fractions were analyzed for protein-N and RNA, and were assayed for RNase and trypsin-activatable proteolytic (TAPase) activity. The zymogen fraction accounted for 30 to 40 per cent of the total TAPase and RNase activities, and its specific enzymatic activities were 4 to 10 times higher than those of any other cell fraction. The zymogen fraction was cytologically heterogeneous; zymogen granules and mitochondria represented its main components. More homogeneous zymogen fractions, obtained by successive washing or by separation in a discontinuous density-gradient, had specific activities 2 to 4 times greater than the crude zymogen fractions. Chymotrypsinogen was isolated by column chromatography from pancreas homogenates and derived cell fractions. The largest amount was recovered in the zymogen fraction. The final supernatant had properties similar to those of the trypsin inhibitor described by Kunitz and Northrop.	A Cytochemical Study on the Pancreas of the Guinea Pig I.

Microsomes were isolated from the pancreas of starved and fed guinea pigs. In the first case, the gland was removed from animals starved for 48 hours; in the second, the pancreas was excised 1 hour after the beginning of a meal that ended a fast of 48 hours. These are referred to below as fed animals. In both cases the tissue was homogenized in 0.88 M sucrose and the microsomes obtained by centrifuging the mitochondrial supernatant at 105,000 g for 60 minutes. In starved animals the content of the endoplasmic reticulum of the exocrine cells and the content of the microsomes were found to be of low or moderate density. In fed guinea pigs the cavities of the reticulum frequently contained dense intracisternal granules and the microsomes were distinguished by a content of high density sometimes in the form of recognizable intracisternal granules. In starved animals, the microsomes were found to account for 5 to 20 per cent of the trypsin-activatable proteolytic activity and ribonuclease activity of the whole cell, whereas in fed animals they contained uniformly almost 30 per cent of these activities. In fed animals the dense, cohesive content of the microsomes (intracisternal granules) could be isolated by breaking up the microsomes with dilute (0.1 per cent) deoxycholate solutions and separating microsomal subfractions by differential centrifugation. The specific enzymatic activities of a heavy microsomal subfraction rich in intracisternal granules were almost equal to those of isolated purified zymogen granules. The ribonucleoprotein particles attached to the microsomal membranes could be isolated by the same technique and found also to exhibit some of the same enzymatic activities. Corresponding subfractions isolated from the microsomes of starved animals were considerably less active. The relevance of these findings for the synthesis and intracellular transport of protein in the exocrine cell of the pancreas is discussed.	A Cytochemical Study on the Pancreas of the Guinea Pig II.

DL-leucine-1-C14 was administered by intracardiac injection to guinea pigs and its in vivo incorporation into the proteins of various pancreatic cell fractions followed over a period of 2 hours. The pancreas was homogenized in 0.88 M sucrose and fractionated by differential centrifugation to give nuclear, zymogen, mitochondrial, microsomal, postmicrosomal, and final supernatant fractions. The proteins of these fractions, obtained by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid followed by washing, were counted. The proteins of the microsomal fraction showed the highest early specific activity and were followed by those of the zymogen and mitochondrial fractions. The microsomal fraction was broken up into two subfractions: one consisting of detached RNP particles, the other representing mainly the microsomal content and membranes. The incorporation of labelled leucine into the proteins of microsomal subtractions and in those of postmicrosomal fractions was studied comparatively in the pancreas of fasted and fed guinea pigs as well as in the liver and pancreas of fasted animals. A tentative cytological picture of protein synthesis and transport based on these findings is presented.	A Cytochemical Study on the Pancreas of the Guinea Pig III.

Mitochondrial fractions, relatively free from contamination by other cytoplasmic structures, have been isolated by differential centrifugation from homogenates of brown adipose tissue from starved rats. It was possible in such fractions to distinguish two types of mitochondria in this tissue. Type I mitochondria, when morphologically intact, are limited by a bilaminar membrane and show regular parallel cristae. In isolated fractions, a proportion of these mitochondria are swollen, vacuolation occurring within the cristae between their limiting membranes. Type II mitochondria are distinguished from the more numerous type I bodies by the opaque appearance of their matrix. They are limited by a membrane which is in part single, and in part double. They show a few, but crisply outlined internal membranes. Vacuolation of this type of mitochondrion has not been observed. Vacuolation comparable to that in brown fat mitochondria was also observed between the two laminae of the enclosing membrane and within the cristae of liver mitochondria.

An investigation of the mechanisms of norepinephrine action and heat production in brown adipose tissue from newborn rabbits has been carried out. Data obtained with the use of biochemical techniques has been correlated with morphological data from electron microscopy. Norepinephrine was found to stimulate the respiration of brown fat in vitro. Inhibitors of glycolysis abolish this effect, whereas inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation do not, at least not to the same extent. Brown fat is readily permeable to added Krebs cycle intermediates. Substrate level phosphorylation, but no electron transport-coupled phosphorylation, could be demonstrated in isolated mitochondria. It is suggested that the rate of fatty acid oxidation is limited by the availability of phosphate acceptor systems which break down ATP formed at the substrate level and thus provide ADP for further substrate level phosphorylation. The theory of respiratory control by the action of reesterification of fatty acids is discussed in the light of these findings. Under the electron microscope, brown fat mitochondria are characterized by their large size, tightly packed cristae, and by the different types of granules in the matrix. No elementary particles are seen when the mitochondria are examined by the negative-staining technique. The absence of electron transport-coupled phosphorylation together with the apparent absence of elementary particles seems to be of particular significance.

The accumulation of some organic anions in the space inaccessible to sucrose of rat liver mitochondria was measured. In untreated mitochondria anions were apparently concentrated from 1mm applied concentration by between five- and 22-fold, depending on their charge. After depletion of endogenous reserves either with uncoupling agent or with oligomycin uptakes were decreased. The accumulation of citrate was restored by combinations of a dicarboxylic acid (malate, succinate, maleate or meso-tartrate) and energy. The energy could either be provided by oxidation of a suitable dicarboxylic acid or from ascorbate in the presence of tetramethylphenylenediamine, or from ATP. The restoration of citrate uptake is not necessarily accompanied by a gain of K+, but a cation- and energy-linked citrate uptake can be induced with valinomycin. When citrate is added to mitochondria in the presence of malate the latter is competitively displaced. The anion accumulation could arise from an internal energy-linked positive potential.

A repeating particle associated with the cristae and the inner membrane of the external envelope has been recognized and characterized in beef heart mitochondria by correlated electron microscopic and biochemical studies. Many thousands (ca. 104 to 105) of these particles, disposed in regular arrays, are present in a single mitochondrion. The repeating particle, called the elementary particle (EP), consists of three parts: (1) a spherical or polyhedral head piece (80 to 100 A in diameter); (2) a cylindrical stalk (about 50 A long and 30 to 40 A wide); and (3) a base piece (40 x 110 A). The base pieces of the elementary particles form an integral part of the outer dense layers of the cristae. The elementary particles can be seen in electron micrographs of mitochondria in situ, of isolated mitochondria, and of submitochondrial particles with a complete electron transfer chain. Negative staining with phosphotungstate is only one of several techniques that can be used for reproducible demonstration of the repeating particles and underlying subunit organization of mitochondrial membranes. A particulate unit containing a complete electron transfer chain can be isolated from beef heart mitochondria. The isolated unit approximates in size that of the elementary particle in situ. The molecular weight of the particle in situ is calculated to be 1.3 x 106. Evidence is presented for identifying the isolated unit with the elementary particle visualized in situ. The elementary particle of the mitochondrion is believed to be a prototype of a class of functional particles or macromolecular assemblies of similar size found in association with membranes generally.

Experiments are reported that demonstrate that in E. coli the pyridine nucleotide-independent D- and L-lactate dehydrogenases and the aerobic L-α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase are membrane bound. These enzymes differed from succinate dehydrogenase in that they could be solubilized by treatment with nonionic detergent while succinate dehydrogenase could not. The binding of these enzymes to membrane was measured in mutants constitutive for the synthesis of various dehydrogenases: in cells in which the amount of dehydrogenases synthesized was greater than in others, the enzymes described above (except succinate dehydrogenase) were found in part in the soluble fraction of the cell extracts. Experiments of oxygen uptake indicate that when a fraction of the enzymes became soluble, this soluble fraction is no longer functional in respiration. These results indicate that it is possible to prevent membrane attachment of certain dehydrogenases by the excess production of other dehydrogenases; it may be that dehydrogenases compete for identical binding sites.

A new method for demonstrating cytochrome oxidase activity, based upon the oxidative polymerization of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to an osmiophilic reaction product, has improved the localization of this enzyme over methods based upon the Nadi reaction, in both the light and electron microscopes. The reaction product occurs in nondroplet form, which more accurately delineates the localization of cytochrome oxidase in mitochondria of heart, liver, and kidney. In electron microscopic preparations the excess reaction product is found to overflow into the intracristate spaces and into the outer compartment between inner and outer limiting mitochondrial membranes. This finding suggests that the enzymatic activity of cytochrome c is located on the inner surface of the intracristate space which is the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Succinic dehydrogenase activity has also been located at this site by using an osmiophilic ditetrazolium salt, TC-NBT. Considered together, the sites of reactivity of both parts of the respiratory chain have implications for the chemiosomotic hypothesis of Mitchell who suggests a mechanism of energy conservation during electron transport in the respiratory chain of the mitochondrion.

Oka, Tetuo (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and Kei Arima. Cyanide resistance in Achromobacter. II. Mechanism of cyanide resistance. J. Bacteriol. 90:744–747. 1965.—Photochemical data showed that the only oxidase found in the cyanide-sensitive cells of Achromobacter was cytochrome o, and that cyanide-resistant cells contained at least two oxidases. The oxidase responsible for cyanide resistance was a pigment the CO compound of which had its absorption band at a wavelength longer than 580 mμ. In addition, kinetic data suggested that there were two oxidases having different affinities for cyanide. From the data presented, resistance to cyanide in Achromobacter strain D was attributed to the induced formation of cytochrome a2, which has a very low affinity for cyanide. Several characteristics of cytochrome a2 as a cytochrome oxidase are summarized.	Cyanide Resistance in Achromobacter II. Mechanism of Cyanide Resistance	Tetuo Oka, Kei Arima	16562076	1965-09-01	19

Bacteriol. 90:734–743. 1965.—By following the cytochrome concentrations during the growth cycle and under various conditions (aerobic, aerobic plus KCN, reduced aeration, anaerobic plus NaNO3) in Achromobacter strain D, a close relationship between the formation of cytochrome a2 (and a1) and the difficulty of oxygen utilization was demonstrated. Cytochrome o, which was the only oxidase found in aerobic log-phase cells, was present in bacterial cells grown under various conditions; the amount present had no relation to the degree of cyanide resistance. On the other hand, cytochrome a2 (and a1) was inducible, and a close relation was observed between the amount of cytochrome and resistance to cyanide. Spectrophotometric observations indicated that, among the cytochromes present in resistant cells, cytochrome a2 could be oxidized most easily in the presence of cyanide and that cytochrome b1 could be oxidized without the oxidation of cytochrome a1. We concluded that cytochrome a2 is a cyanide-resistant oxidase capable of catalyzing the oxidation of cytochromes in the presence of cyanide. Cytochrome a2 is also resistant to azide, an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase.	Cyanide Resistance in Achromobacter I.

Acid-treated extracts of Escherichia coli were tested for their ability to restore reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-nitrate reductase activity to an extract of a Neurospora nit-1 mutant which produces a defective enzyme. With wild-type E. coli this complementation activity was more readily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, although the nitrate reductase activity was found primarily in the particulate fraction. chlB mutants of E. coli appeared to have more complementation activity in the cytoplasm than was observed in the wild type, but no activity in the particulate fraction. The other chl mutants had little or no activity in either fraction. These results suggest that chlB mutants can produce a component or cofactor which is missing in the other mutants and in the Neurospora mutant, but cannot transfer it to the nitrate reductase enzyme.

Mitochondria isolated from the ascites form of L1210 mouse leukemia cells readily accumulate Ca2+ from the suspending medium and eject H+ during oxidation of succinate in the presence of phosphate and Mg2+, with normal stoichiometry between Ca2+ uptake and electron transport. Ca2+ loads up to 1600 ng-atoms per mg of protein are attained. As is the case in mitochondria from normal tissues, Ca2+ uptake takes precedence over oxidative phosphorylation. However, Ca2+ transport by the L-1210 mitochondria is unusual in other respects, which may possibly have general significance in tumor cells. The apparent affinity of the L1210 mitochondria for Ca2+ in stimulation of oxygen uptake is about 3-fold greater than in normal liver mitochondria; moreover, the maximal rate of Ca2+ transport is also considerably higher. Furthermore, when Ca2+ pulses are added to L1210 mitochondria in the absence of phosphate or other permeant anions, much larger amounts of Ca2+ are bound and H+ ejected per atom of oxygen consumed than in the presence of phosphate; up to 7 Ca2+ ions are bound per pair of electrons passing each energy-conserving site of the electron-transport chain. Such “superstoichiometry” of Ca2+ uptake can be accounted for by two distinct types of respiration-dependent interaction of Ca2+ with the L1210 mitochondria. One is the stimulation of oxygen consumption, which is achieved by relatively low concentrations of Ca2+ (Km ≅ 8 μM) and is accompanied by binding of Ca2+ up to 40 ng-atoms per mg of protein. The second process, also dependent on electron transport, is the binding of further Ca2+ from the medium in exchange with previously stored membrane-bound protons, in which the affinity for Ca2+ is much lower (Km ≅ 120 μM).

1. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3) of Candida utilis exhibited altered properties when the organism was grown under iron-limited conditions. No suitable acceptor was found for assay of this enzyme from iron-limited cells. 2. Mitochondrial membrane proteins from C. utilis were analysed by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Compared with glycerol-limited cells, iron limitation resulted in the loss of at least two polypeptides from the mitochondrial membrane. 3. Neither of the polypeptides affected by iron limitation was part of a cytochrome, although one of them was part of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. 4. Non-haem iron of mitochondrial membranes was released in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate, and electrophoresis in solutions of this detergent cannot be used directly to identify iron–sulphur proteins. Non-ionic detergents do not release non-haem iron but nor do they provide a satisfactory system for electrophoretic separation.

"E.p.r- (electron-paramagnetic-resonance) spectroscopy was used to compare chemical environment and reactivity of molybdenum, flavin and iron-sulphur centres in the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase from Veillonella alcalescens (Micrococcus lactilyticus) with those of the corresponding centres in milk xanthine oxidase. The dehydrogenase is frequently contaminated with small but variable amounts of a species resistant to oxidation and giving a new molybdenum (V) e.p.r. signal, ""Resting I"". There is also a ""desulpho"" form of the enzyme giving a Slow Mo(V) signal, indistinguishable from that of the milk enzyme. Molybdenum of the active enzyme behaves in a manner analogous to that of the milk enzyme, giving a Rapid Mo(V) signal on partial reduction with substrates or dithionite. Detailed comparison shows that molybdenum in each enzyme must have the same ligand atoms arranged in the same manner. As with the milk enzyme, complex-formation between reduced dehydrogenase and purine substrate molecules, presumably interacting at the normal substrate-binding site, modifies the Rapid signal, confirming that such substrates interact near molybdenum. The dehydrogenase-flavin semiquinone signal is identical with that of the oxidase but, in contrast, there is only one iron-sulphur signal. The latter gives an e.p.r. spectrum similar to that of aldehyde oxidase."

The turkey enzyme is contaminated by up to three non-functional forms, giving molybdenum e.p.r. signals designated Resting I, Resting II and Slow. Slow and to a lesser extent Resting I signals are like those from the Veillonella enzyme, whereas Resting II is very like a resting signal described by K. V. Rajagopolan, P. Handler, G. Palmer & H. Beinert (1968) (J. Biol. Chem. 243, 3784-3796) for aldehyde oxidase. Another non-functional form that gives the Inhibited signal is produced on treatment of the enzyme with formaldehyde. Stopped-flow measurements at 450 nm show that, as for the milk enzyme, reduction by xanthine is rate-limiting in enzyme turnover. The active enzyme gives rise to Very Rapid and Rapid molybdenum(V) e.p.r. signals, as well as to an FADH signal. That these signals are almost indistinguishable from those of the milk enzyme, confirms the similarities between the active sites. There are two types of iron-sulphur centres that give signals like those in the milk enzyme, though with slightly different parameters. Quantitative reduction titration of the functional enzyme with xanthine revealed two important differences between the turkey and the milk enzymes. First, the turkey enzyme FADH/FADH2 system has a redox potential sufficiently low that xanthine is incapable of reducing the flavin completely. This finding presumably explains the very low oxidase activity. Secondly, whereas the Fe/S II chromophore in the milk enzyme has a relatively high redox potential, for the turkey enzyme the value of this potential is lower and similar to that of its Fe/S I chromophore.ImagesFig. 8.

A new non-functional modified form of milk xanthine oxidase is described. This contains molybdenum in a quinquivalent state, which is resistant to both oxidation and reduction. The new species is derived from the native enzyme in a two-step process. The first step is the conversion into the desulpho form, via loss of the 'persulphide' sulphur, and the second involves reaction with ethylene glycol or other reagents. The species gives a characteristic Mo(V) electron-paramagnetic-resonance signal, without proton splittings, designated Resting II. This is virtually identical with signals reported previously from resting turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase and rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase. The possibility is discussed that species Resting II, prepared with ethylene glycol, contains a -COCH2OH residue bound to a nitrogen ligand of molybdenum.

Some envelope proteins of Escherichia coli show variable behavior in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, depending upon the conditions of the solubilization. When solubilized in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 70 C for 20 min, three distinct peaks (peaks 4, 6, and 7) are seen at molecular weights of 57,800, 44,300, and 38,400, respectively. However, when the envelope fractions are solubilized in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 C for 5 min, or when they are treated with N, N-dimethylformamide at acidic pH before solubilization by our method, only a single peak at 48,000 molecular weight is observed in the molecular weight range mentioned above. That is, peaks 4 and 7 disappear and a new peak appears at the position overlapping with peak 6. Proteins isolated from peaks 4 and 7 show the similar molecular weight shifts to the new peak by the treatment at 100 C. No other peaks show any change by the heat treatment. The increase at the new peak is completely accounted for by the decrease at peaks 4 and 7, indicating that the new peak is composed of proteins from peaks 4, 6, and 7. However, it is concluded that these three peaks consist of distinctly different proteins for the following reasons: (i) they have different amino acid compositions, (ii) they show different solubilities in the nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40, and as shown previously, (iii) peak 6 (protein Y) is related to deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, and (iv) proteins in peaks 4, 6, and 7 have different resistance to proteolytic enzymes. Although the reasons for the anomalous molecular weight shifts of these peaks are not well understood at present, it is important to solubilize the E. coli envelope proteins by the standard method in order to investigate their properties and functions of the envelope proteins.Images	Homogeneity of Envelope Proteins of Escherichia coli Separated by Gel Electrophoresis in Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate	Masayori Inouye, Mei-Lan Yee	4569407	1973-01-01	19	
Extraction of a partially purified preparation of cell walls from Escherichia coli with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 removed all cytoplasmic membrane contamination but did not affect the normal morphology of the cell wall. This Triton-treated preparation, termed the “Triton-insoluble cell wall,” contained all of the protein of the cell wall but only about half of the lipopolysaccharide and one-third of the phospholipid of the cell wall. This Triton-insoluble cell wall preparation was used as a starting material in an investigation of several further treatments. Reextraction of the Triton-insoluble cell wall with either Triton X-100 or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) caused no further solubilization of protein. However, when the Triton-insoluble cell wall was extracted with a combination of Triton X-100 and EDTA, about half of the protein and all of the remaining lipopolysaccharide and phospholipid were solubilized. The material which remained insoluble after this combined Triton and EDTA extraction still retained some of the morphological features of the intact cell wall. Treatment of the Triton-insoluble cell wall with lysozyme resulted in a destruction of the peptidoglycan layer as seen in the electron microscope and in a release of diaminopimelic acid from the cell wall but did not solubilize any cell wall protein. Extraction of this lysozyme-treated preparation with a combination of Triton X-100 and EDTA again solubilized about half of the cell wall protein but resulted in a drastic change in the morphology of the Triton-EDTA-insoluble material. After this treatment, the insoluble material formed lamellar structures. These results are interpreted in terms of the types of noncovalent bonds involved in maintaining the organized structure of the cell wall and suggest that the main forces involved are hydrophobic protein-protein interactions between the cell wall proteins and to a lesser degree a stabilization of protein-protein and protein-lipopolysaccharide interactions by divalent cations. A model for the structure of the E. coli cell wall is presented.Images	Effect of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid, Triton X-100, and Lysozyme on the Morphology and Chemical Composition of Isolated Cell Walls of Escherichia coli	Carl A.

Imaeda, Tamotsu (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas, Caracas, Venezuela) and Mitua Ogura. Formation of intracytoplasmic membrane system of mycobacteria related to cell division. J. Bacteriol. 85:150–163. 1963.—Mycobacterium leprae, M. lepraemurium, and a Mycobacterium sp. were observed with an electron microscope. In these bacilli, the three-dimensional structure of the intracytoplasmic membrane system consists of tubular infoldings of the invaginated plasma membrane. The moderately dense substance, presumably representing the cell-wall precursor, is found in the membranous system, especially in the rapid growth phase of mycobacteria. This system always shows an intimate relationship with cell division. A low-density zone, probably corresponding to the low-density substance which coats the cell wall, appears in the connecting regions of the system and in the longitudinal portion of the cell wall. These zones extend centripetally, and the separation of the cell wall occurs after the two zones meet. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the intracytoplasmic membrane system may produce cell-wall material during cell division of mycobacteria.Images	FORMATION OF INTRACYTOPLASMIC MEMBRANE SYSTEM OF MYCOBACTERIA RELATED TO CELL DIVISION	Tamotsu Imaeda, Mituo Ogura	13956365	1963-01-01	19	
Edwards, Mercedes R. (New York State Department of Health, Albany) and Roy W. Stevens. Fine structure of Listeria monocytogenes. J. Bacteriol. 86:414–428. 1963.—Cells of Listeria monocytogenes, at different stages of growth, were fixed with osmium tetroxide and treated with uranyl acetate. The material was dehydrated in alcohol, embedded in prepolymerized methacrylate, and studied in thin sections. In most of the micrographs, the plasmalemma (or plasma membrane) showed a pattern of three dense lines, each ca. 25 A thick, alternating with two light zones, each ca. 30 A thick. The outer light zone was regularly bridged by strands of dense material, and the inner one was not. The dense line at the edge of the cytoplasm was not always discernible because of its similarity in density with the ground cytoplasm, although it could be easily demonstrated in lysed cells and in protoplasts. The latter were found to be limited by a pair of dense lines, each ca. 25 A thick, bounding a light core ca. 30 A thick. This structure corresponds to a “unit” membrane, but it represents only a part of the plasmalemma of the intact cell; it was therefore interpreted as being more complex than a single unit membrane. Intracytoplasmic membranes of various configurations were clearly shown to be extensions of the plasmalemma. They may branch repeatedly and anastomose to form a complicated honeycomb-like organelle or organelles of different appearances, sometimes lamellate. The lamellar bodies are envisioned as resulting from spiraled ingrowths. The various kinds of ingrowths of the plasmalemma were designated “plasmalemmosomes” to indicate their origin; however, some of these organelles in Listeria were similar to those described in different bacteria by other authors. Plasmalemmosomes have been found in both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells. Another outstanding feature in many micrographs was the nucleoid, which contains dense fibrils measuring 25 to 50 A in diameter. These fibrils frequently appeared to be coiled and were of the order of magnitude ascribed to deoxyribonucleic acid molecules.Images	FINE STRUCTURE OF LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES	Mercedes R.

Fitz-James, Philip (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada). Fate of the mesosomes of Bacillus megaterium during protoplasting. J. Bacteriol. 87:1483–1491. 1964.—When cells of Bacillus megaterium growing rapidly in peptone medium are treated with sucrose buffer prior to protoplasting, their membranous organelles or mesosomes are extruded as a collection of vesicles into the wall-membrane interspace. On subsequent protoplast formation with lysozyme digestion, the mesosome remnants become dispersed. If glucose is added to the peptone, a slightly more persistent mesosome can be seen and photographed by phase microscopy during lysozyme digestion, either as a wall-attached granule or as a protoplast tag. In thin section, mesosomes are found as small, variably dispersed aggregates of vesicles and wall-like material. Complete protoplasts are usually free from internal mesosomes but may contain twists or everted pockets of membrane on their periphery. By lysozyme digestion of partially fixed cells, the empty mesosome pockets in the membrane can be demonstrated in rod-shaped protoplasts.Images	FATE OF THE MESOSOMES OF BACILLUS MEGATERIUM DURING PROTOPLASTING	Philip Fitz-James	14188732	1964-06-01	19	
Ryter, Antoinette (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), and Otto E. Landman. An electron microscope study of the relationship between mesosome loss and the stable L-state (or protoplast state) in Bacillus subtilis. J. Bacteriol. 88:457–467. 1964.—In a prior publication, it was postulated that inability of protoplasts to restart cell-wall synthesis and cell division and the inability of stable mass-conversion L forms to return to the bacillary state were both equivalent and both due to the interruption of a membrane-associated reaction sequence. It was further postulated that this reaction sequence might reside in the mesosome. In the present publication, it is shown by means of electron microscopy of thin sections that protoplasts and L forms do not contain mesosomes. The sequence of events leading to loss of the mesosomes during protoplasting is as follows. Soon after lysozyme addition, the mesosomes are extruded from the cell interior into the space between cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane. Mesosome fragments in the form of small vesicles gather at the poles of the cells and are released, along with intact protoplasts, when the wall fragments. (Sudden shift of bacilli to hypertonic environment also causes extrusion and fragmentation of mesosomes, but this damage is later repaired.) In intact bacilli, mesosomes are in contact with both the peripheral membrane and nuclear material. Upon extrusion of the mesosomes, a direct attachment between nuclear material and cytoplasmic membrane is observed. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-membrane attachment may play a role in the control of DNA replication. Bacillus subtilis L-colonies consist of irregularly shaped bodies of varying sizes, bounded only by a membrane. Many of the smaller bodies do not contain nuclear material, and many of the large ones appear inviable. Division is accomplished by a disorganized-appearing constriction process. There are no septa.Images	ELECTRON MICROSCOPE STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MESOSOME LOSS AND THE STABLE L STATE (OR PROTOPLAST STATE) IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS	Antoinette Ryter, Otto E.

Bladen, Howard A. (National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, Md.), Marie U. Nylen, and Robert J. Fitzgerald. Internal structures of a Eubacterium sp. demonstrated by the negative staining technique. J. Bacteriol. 88:763–770. 1964.—Thin sections as well as negatively stained whole cells of a Eubacterium sp. isolated from the rat cecum were examined in a Siemens Elmiskop I electron microscope. The cell wall usually appeared in thin sections as a single dense layer about 130 A thick; however, occasionally it was demonstrated to be composed of three layers. The plasma membrane was approximately 130 A wide, and was composed of a denselight-dense arrangement. Intracytoplasmic membranous elements continuous with the plasma membrane were also observed in thin sections. When whole cells were negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid, the cell wall became transparent, and structures comparable in morphology to intracytoplasmic membranous elements were observed. These were demonstrated by stereomicroscopy to be in the interior environment of the cell, and appeared in many cases continuous with the cell wall. Frequently, they seemed to open to the exterior of the cell through what may be termed a pore. Small stalked structures similar to those described in mitochondria were observed along the periphery of the cell and occasionally along the walls of the internal elements.Images	INTERNAL STRUCTURES OF A EUBACTERIUM SP.

Colonies and spore suspensions of Streptomyces coelicolor were fixed by the method of Kellenberger, Ryter, and Séchaud (1958) and embedded in methacrylate or araldite. Thin sections were cut with an A. F. Huxley microtome and examined in a Siemens' Elmiskop I. At all stages of development the hyphae of Streptomyces coelicolor have an extensive membranous component in the cytoplasm. The membranes are continuous with the plasma membrane and have a variety of configurations at different places in the hyphae. Tubular structures, vesicles, and parallel stacks of membranes are seen. In some areas concentric layers of membranes form whorled structures which are particularly frequent in the region of developing cross-walls and within maturing spores. In the spores membranous structures often lie embedded in the nuclear material. In disintegrating hyphae the intracytoplasmic membranes round off into small vesicles and remain when the rest of the cytoplasmic structure has gone. In the absence of typical mitochondria and other cytoplasmic membranous structures it is possible that the membranous component of the cytoplasm of Streptomyces coelicolor may perform the functions of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or the mitochondria of higher cells.

Treatment of a partially purified preparation of cell walls of Escherichia coli with Triton X-100 at 23 C resulted in a solubilization of 15 to 25% of the protein. Examination of the Triton-insoluble material by electron microscopy indicated that the characteristic morphology of the cell wall was not affected by the Triton extraction. Contaminating fragments of the cytoplasmic membrane were removed by Triton X-100, including the fragments of the cytoplasmic membrane which were normally observed attached to the cell wall. Treatment of a partially purified cytoplasmic membrane fraction with Triton X-100 resulted in the solubilization of 60 to 80% of the protein of this fraction. Comparison of the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble proteins from the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane fractions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after removal of the Triton by gel filtration in acidified dimethyl formamide indicated that the detergent specifically solubilized proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane. The proteins solubilized from the cell wall fraction were qualitatively identical to those solubilized from the cytoplasmic membrane fraction, but were present in different proportions, suggesting that the fragments of cytoplasmic membrane which are attached to the cell wall are different in composition from the remainder of the cytoplasmic membrane of the cell. Treatment of unfractionated envelope preparations with Triton X-100 resulted in the solubilization of 40% of the protein, and only proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane were solubilized. Extraction with Triton thus provides a rapid and specific means of separating the proteins of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli.Images	Solubilization of the Cytoplasmic Membrane of Escherichia coli by Triton X-100	Carl A.

A nitrogenase system that remains in the supernatant fluid after centrifuging for 3 hr at 180,000 × g can be extracted from Azotobacter vinelandii by osmotic lysis of the bacteria. This nitrogenase preparation is oxygen-labile and appears to be similar, though not identical, to that obtained from Clostridium pasteurianum. The particulate characteristic and oxygen stability of previously described preparations are likely due to the method of cell disruption, e.g., in the French pressure cell. The data support a nitrogenase model system in the intact cell in which oxygen-labile enzymes are protected from oxygen by the extensive internal membranous system which Azotobacter synthesize only when they fix nitrogen.Images	Properties of a Soluble Nitrogenase in Azotobacter	Joel Oppenheim, Robert J.

Utilization of iron (Fe3+) by Escherichia coli depends upon a system which is determined by at least two genetic loci. Mutants which carry a deletion of the tonB-trp region of the chromosome grow only when very high concentrations of iron are present in the medium. These strains are sensitive to chromic ion (Cr3+) and, unlike the parent strain, fail to grow on MnSO4 when FeSO4 is not added to the medium. A second type of mutant, Chr2, which was isolated on the basis of its sensitivity to chromic ion, also requires a high concentration of iron for growth. This mutant can be distinguished phenotypically from the deletion mutants since it grows normally on low concentrations of iron, provided citrate is added to the medium. The chromium sensitivity of both types of mutants can be reversed by high concentrations of exogenous iron. The data are interpreted to indicate that the E. coli mutants studied are defective in iron transport and that residual iron transport is in some way inhibited by chromic ion.

Escherichia coli strains B/r and 2276 contain an active transport system for iron. The system is energy-dependent, repressed by excess iron in the growth medium, and capable of accumulating iron inside of the cells at concentrations 2,000-fold higher than those in the medium. Two tonB-trp deletion mutants, strains B/rlt and B/lt7, which are sensitive to chromic ion and require high levels of iron for normal growth, are deficient in this active transport system. A point mutant, strain Chr2, which is also sensitive to chromic ion and requires high levels of iron for growth, has the active uptake system but cannot synthesize a specific chelator for iron, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine (DHBS). Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that both the active uptake system and chelation of iron by DHBS play a role in iron uptake from iron-deficient medium. The chromium sensitivity of the mutants can be explained by inhibition of uptake of exogenous iron.

A number of mutants of Salmonella typhimurium were isolated which are blocked in the biosynthesis of enterobactin, an iron chelator that is secreted by the wild-type bacteria when they are grown on low iron media. One class of these enb mutants accumulates the enterobactin precursor 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and another class does not accumulate any detectable catechol precursor. The enb mutants grow very well on a glucose-mineral salts medium. Addition of citrate, itself an iron chelator, to the medium drastically inhibits growth unless the medium is supplemented with enterobactin or iron salts. Citrate inhibits iron uptake from the medium by enb mutants; enterobactin counteracts this inhibition and also, by itself, increases iron uptake. Thus, the apparent function of enterobactin is to promote the absorption of iron from the medium by the bacteria. Transduction experiments showed that the genes for enterobactin biosynthesis are closely linked on the S. typhimurium chromosome. It is suggested that they form an operon which is repressed by the presence of iron. S. typhimurium can utilize the iron chelate ferrichrome. (Deferriferrichrome is a cyclic hexapeptide that is produced by some fungi but not by S. typhimurium.) The enb mutants use ferrichrome as an effective growth factor.Images	Iron Transport in Salmonella typhimurium: Mutants Blocked in the Biosynthesis of Enterobactin	J. R. Pollack, Bruce N. Ames, J. B.

Gramicidin and valinomycin in concentrations of 10−7 and 10−6m, respectively, inhibited the growth of Streptococcus faecalis. Inhibition of growth was associated with loss of Rb+ and K+ from the cells, and could be reversed by addition of excess K+. Cells treated with these antibiotics exhibited greatly increased permeability to certain cations; no effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Unlike normal cells, cells treated with gramicidin rapidly lost internal Rb+ by passive exchange with external cations, including H+, all monovalent alkali metals, NH4+, Mg++, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. Exchange was rapid even at 0 C and was independent of energy metabolism. The effect of valinomycin was more selective. Cellular Rb+ was rapidly displaced by external H+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+; other cations were less effective. The exchange was independent of metabolism but strongly affected by temperature. Under certain conditions, polyvalent cations inhibited exchange between 86Rb and Rb+ induced by valinomycin. The antibiotic apparently neither stimulates nor inhibits the energy-dependent K+ pump of S. faecalis, but exerts its effect on the passive permeability of the membrane to cations. The increased permeability to specific cations induced by gramicidin and valinomycin is a sufficient explanation for the inhibition of growth, glycolysis, and other processes.

The kinetics of oxidation of ubiquinone, flavoprotein, cytochrome c, and the cytochrome b complex in skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) mitochondria made anaerobic with succinate have been measured spectrophotometrically and fluorimetrically in the absence of respiratory inhibitor and in the presence of cyanide or antimycin A. No component identifiable by these means was oxidized rapidly enough in the presence of one or the other inhibitor to qualify for the role of alternate oxidase. Cycles of oxidation and rereduction of flavoprotein and ubiquinone obtained by injecting 12 μm oxygen into the anaerobic mitochondrial suspension were kinetically indistinguishable in the presence of cyanide or antimycin A, implying that these 2 components are part of a respiratory pathway between succinate and oxygen which does not involve the cytochromes and does involve a cyanide-insensitive alternate oxidase. The cytochrome b complex shows biphasic oxidation kinetics with half times of 0.018 sec and 0.4 sec in the absence of inhibitor, which increase to 0.2 sec and 1 sec in the presence of cyanide. In the presence of antimycin A, the oxidation of the cytochrome b complex shows an induction period of 1 sec and a half-time of 3.5 sec. A split respiratory chain with 2 terminal oxidases and a branch point between the cytochromes and flavoprotein and ubiquinone is proposed for these mitochondria.

Mitochondria were prepared from the spadices of skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) whose respiratory rate with succinate and malate showed 15% to 30% sensitivity to cyanide inhibition, and which showed respiratory control by added ADP. The observed respiratory control ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.4. The change in pH of the mitochondrial suspension was recorded simultaneously with oxygen uptake: alkalinization of the medium, expected for phosphorylation of ADP, coincided with the period of acceleration in oxygen uptake caused by addition of an ADP aliquot. The ADP/O ratios obtained were 1.3 for succinate and 1.9 for malate. In the presence of 0.3 mm cyanide, the ADP/O ratio for succinate was zero, while that for malate was 0.7. These results are consistent with the existence of an alternate oxidase which interacts with the flavoprotein and pyridine nucleotide components of the respiratory chain and which, in the presence of cyanide, allows the first phosphorylation site to function with an efficiency of about 70%. In the absence of respiratory inhibitors, the efficiency of each phosphorylation site is also about 70%. This result implies that diversion of reducing equivalents through the alternate oxidase, thereby bypassing the 2 phosphorylation sites associated with the cytochrome components of these mitochondria, occurs to a negligible extent during the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP or State 3.Addition of ADP or uncoupler to skunk cabbage mitochondria respiring in the controlled state or State 4, results in reduction of cytochrome c and the oxidation of the cytochromes b, ubiquinone and pyridine nucleotide. A site of interaction of ADP with the respiratory chain between cytochromes b and cytochrome c is thereby identified by means of the crossover theorem. Flavoprotein measured by fluorescence is also oxidized upon addition of ADP or uncoupler, but flavoprotein measured by optical absorbance changes becomes more reduced under these conditions. Depletion of the mitochondria by pretreatment with ADP and uncoupler prevents reduction of most of the fluorescent flavoprotein by succinate. These results indicate that skunk cabbage mitochondria contain both high and low potential flavo-proteins characterized by different fluorescence/absorbance ratios similar to those demonstrated to be part of the respiratory chain in mitochondria from animal tissues.

"Respiration of a normal strain of Candida albicans was compared with that of a divisionless mutant which has a biochemical lesion such that metabolically generated hydrogen ""spills over,"" during growth, for non-specific dye reduction. This waste is not at expense of growth, since both strains grow at essentially similar rates, nor at expense of respiration, since the mutant reduces oxygen more rapidly than the normal strain. Respiration in both strains is qualitatively similar, and seemingly unique among highly aerobic organisms in that it is not mediated by cytochrome oxidase. In resting cells of both strains, respiration is not only resistant to, but markedly stimulated by, high concentrations of cyanide, carbon monoxide, and azide. In contrast, growth of these yeasts is inhibited by low concentrations of cyanide and azide. Cytochrome oxidase could not be detected in cell-free preparations; reduced cytochrome c was not oxidized by such preparations. Cytochrome bands could not be observed in thick cell suspensions treated with reducing agents. However, incorporation of superoptimal levels of zinc and iron into the culture medium resulted in growth of cells possessing distinct cytochrome bands; respiration of these cells remained insensitive to cyanide, monoxide, and azide, and the bands were maintained in a reduced form on oxygenation. In the divisionless yeast, tetrazolium dyes compete with oxygen for reduction; this is not the case in the normal strain. The firmness with which hydrogen transfer is channeled in the latter for reduction of disulfide bonds (of importance in the division mechanism) and of oxygen, is contrasted with the lack of such control in the mutant."

Membrane-envelope fragments have been isolated from Escherichia coli by comparatively mild techniques. The use of DNAase, RNAase, detergents, sonication, lysozyme, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate were avoided in the belief that rather delicate, but metabolically important, associations may exist between the plasma membrane and various cytoplasmic components. The membrane-envelope fragments have been characterized in terms of their content of major chemical components as well as their electron microscope appearance. Fractions containing membrane-envelope fragments were found to possess appreciable DNA- and protein-synthesizing activities. The fragments were rich in membrane content as determined by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity and deficient in soluble components as measured by NADH dehydrogenase activity. The particulate fraction obtained between 20,000 g and 105,000 g and usually considered a ribosomal fraction was rich in membrane content and had a relatively high capacity for DNA synthesis. Envelope fragments sedimenting at 20,000 g attained very high levels of incorporation of amino acids into protein.
